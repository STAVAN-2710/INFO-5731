review
"After eight years in seclusion, Batman resurfaces to face Bane, a mastermind bent on destroying Gotham and has ties to Bruce Wayne's past. Christopher Nolan's conclusion to his Dark Knight trilogy should be treated as a wrap up rather than a third installment. Despite many new characters being introduced, even their conflicts and motives are derived from events that occurred in the previous two films. Such an approach could be seen as a weakness, since the conflict could just end up being sort of a rematch rather than moving the story forward; however, Nolan's approach works terrificly. Over an hour is shot in stunning IMAX, but the film is more touching than it is intense and that's its best quality. Hardy steps in as the genius mercenary Bane, who is slightly bigger, slightly stronger and slightly smarter than Batman, thus making him a challenge best suited for the grand finale. The Joker works best as Batman's arch-nemesis since they are polar opposites, with The Joker standing for everything Batman stands against. Two-Face works best as Batman's most tragic enemy because Harvey Dent is very much like Bruce Wayne the only difference is: Dent copes with his tragedy through revenge rather than seeking justice as Wayne did. Bane works best as Batman's most challenging villain because of his physical and mental superiority—forget the Bane you saw in ""BATMAN & ROBIN"". Nolan carefully chose all his villains in the series wisely and executed them perfectly. Hardy had big shoes to fill following Ledger's posthumous Oscar winning performance; while Bane is no Joker, Hardy does a satisfying job and should not be compared to Ledger's performance as they are completely different roles. It is Michael Caine, however, that delivers the most memorable and touching performance of the entire film. A wonderful conclusion to a wonderful trilogy.

"The Dark Knight Rises was a perfect sequel to a masterpiece. Christopher Nolan took a different direction and focused more on Bruce Wayne/Batman. This movie is filled with lots of emotions. It has such great characters and of course the dialogs is so good. The performances are incredible. It was my most anticipated movie of the century. The more I watch it, The more epic it gets. Personally, I think The Dark Knight Trilogy is the greatest Trilogy of all time and this movie gives the greatest ending of all time in the movie history. I remember seeing it thrice and the more I watched It the more respect it earns. Thank you Christopher Nolan, You Sir Are A Master."
"Possibly my personal favourite of the Nolan Batman films, and I do like Batman Begins and The Dark Knight very much. Is it perfect? For me, not quite, there are so many plot strand in a long running time that the film occasionally(and there is a big emphasis on that) sags in momentum and some of the strands in the ending could have done with more development. It is a brilliant film all the same, one of the highlights so far of the year. As to expect from Christopher Nolan, it is a visually audacious film, with gorgeous cinematography, a beautifully realised Gotham City and great special effects. Hans Zimmer's score is not one of his very best for me, but there is still an epic and haunting quality that is just perfect for this film. The dialogue provokes thought and makes an emotional impact, and a vast majority of the time The Dark Knight Rises is ambitious and gripping. I don't consider Christopher Nolan one of my favourites, this said he is a hugely impressive director who shows great ambition and a willingness to make his subject matters interesting. He does a really wonderful job here, as the set/action pieces including the plane hijack and Bane's assault on Gotham are enough to make the jaw drop. The performances are just terrific from all involved, Matthew Modine fares weakest but he is far from bad. Christian Bale is still a charismatic presence, Matthew Caine appropriately loyal and Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman subtly understated. Joseph Gordon Levitt captures his character's idealism wonderfully. Tom Hardy is in beefed-up terrifying mode as Bane, a worthy successor to Heath Ledger's iconic Joker. Anne Hathaway was a curious casting choice, but as Catwoman she is spot on, here is a Catwoman who actually does much more than acting sexy(which she still is), she is very ruthless and no-nonsense here. All in all, a hugely impressive film, the best of Nolan's Batman trilogy- though I'm prepared for any flaming I'll get for this opinion- and one of the highlights so far of 2012. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"There's a storm coming .....

Years after being villified, Batman is encouraged once again to come Gotham's aid, as it's in the grip of a group of mercenaries run by the villainous Bane.

First of all, you don't have to be a superhero fan to enjoy this great movie, it truly does have the most broad appeal, there's something here for everyone to enjoy. If you liked the two preceding films, I figure you'll love this one, I'm a fan of all three, this is my personal favourite.

It's a long movie, but it flies by at a canter, no single frame is wasted, it moves by at a terrific pace, it has incredible action sequences, but the story is terrific.

It's really interesting to see Batman coming in from a position where he's decided and feared, he's no longer accepted as Gotham's hero and saviour.

Christian Bale is the perfect Batman, and he is matched every step of the way by Tom Hardy. Hardy is off the charts as Bane, the last time we saw the character was back in The Batman and Robin film, perhaps best forgotten, here though he's an iconic villain.

I can't speak highly enough of Bale and Hardy, but this is also, I think the best of Anne Hathaway, she is excellent here.

A decade on, and this film is still fabulous.

10/10."
"Christopher Nolan's epic trilogy concludes in glorious fashion and gives us a thought provoking and suitably satisfying conclusion to an epic saga. It's emotional, intense and has a great villain in Tom Hardy."
"Not being a huge fan of superhero movies, I didn't have much expectations for Batman Begins. However viewing the 2005 Christopher Nolan production, I was pleasantly shocked. Then after my huge expectations for, ""The Dark Knight"", Christopher Nolan blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, ""The Dark Knight Rises""? Quite simply, Yes! My big expectations were once again, blown away. What a production! This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The editing, sound, score, visuals, direction and action are all top notch.

The film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Christian Bale, of course still makes is a great Batman. Michael Cain is fantastic, as he always is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be considered for an Oscar nomination. Tom Hardy as Bane is utterly terrifying, at times, and completely ominous. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman/Selina Kyle is a scene stealer. She is completely engrossing. Everyone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors are so well done, so well written, and so well directed. The Dark Knight Rises is is emotionally riveting and amazing to view.

At a running time of almost 3 hours, the film never becomes dull, which is pretty impressive. The movie's action sequences are spectacularly well created and very intense. The dialogue between the character's are intelligent and highly believable. The movie's soundtrack is terrific and really exemplify's many of the movie's scenes. Extremely well editing and sound use really develop many of the movie's action scenes, so it's not just explosions and visuals like in many other movies. Nolan creates a grand, dirty, engrossing world, and his action sequences just hum.

In conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that great writing and direction can enhance any movie-going experience, even superhero movies, which are usually thought of as mindless entertainment. I am wholly satisfied with Christopher Nolan's vision and thank all who worked on this film for bringing such an intricate interpretation of its very famous literary source. I cannot recommend this film anymore than I have, I just have to say everyone and anyone should see it. 10/10"""
"I think as a film stand point, the dark knight is a better movie that is better acted and tense the whole way through. The dark knight rises to me is a more fun and action filled movie that you can sit back a bit more. The acting is still amazing and combined with the atmosphere/visuals of the movie creates a the sense of realism that the movie has. That realism is where the intensity stems from throughout the movie, the audience believing that something like this could actually happen makes it that much scarier. Bane is also an excellent villain, in the dark knight the joker challenges Batman mentally but Bane physically challenges him which is a completely new challenge for Batman. The plot is incredible, it it starts fast and instantly brings you into the action. It then takes a step back to develop the characters further and build up the challenge Batman has to face. Once one of the many challenges was overcome by Batman in launches the viewer straight back into action for one epic final battle that lasts almost an hour......and it is GLORIOUS! Not one second was I bored, it is truly incredible how each movie in the trilogy is this good, it shouldn't be possible. I've not even mentioned the incredible soundtrack to compliment the astounding yet grounded action. I can't compliment this movie enough. If you haven't someone seen this trilogy yet....watch it, you won't be disappointed."
"I came out with slight disappointment after watching DKR for I had huge expectations from Nolan after an exceptional TDK.

I am huge fan of first two installment of Batman Trilogy. I liked DKR, it's a good movie, but it could have been much better.

So rather than discussing its merit, which are many, I am pointing out its shortcomings.

It's the weaker than other movies of trilogy and simple reason being it lacks strong characters. DKR is all about storytelling, just like Nolan's Inception, but not as efficient. And in doing so, it fails where Batman Begins and The Dark Knight had succeeded.

Batman Begins was all about fear, doubt, self-realization and redemption where Bruce Wayne discovers his destiny as Batman. BB had a story arc which set background for main characters - Batman / Wayne, Ra's al Ghul, Gordon (to some extent) and most importantly Gothom City and hence set stage for a fitting climax.

The Dark Knight explores the theme of chaos, morality and belief effortlessly and establishes characters of Joker, Harvey Dent/Two Face, Rachel etc. So effortlessly that people choose to ignore even some major plot holes. Heath Ledger's interpretation of Joker was so mesmerizing that it single handily carried TDK to path of greatness/ critical acclaim.

But Dark Knight Rises is all about story telling - efficient but not exceptional. Bane, Miranda Tate, John Blake, Peter Folly (Deputy Commissioner), Selina Kyle - characters are introduced but never explored/ expanded - they just start working on their part - just like cogs in the wheel. They are not so much part of the story itself but just the agents which move the story forward.

Bane's character is dull and single dimensional and do not evoke any fear or awe. He's meticulous, intelligent and strong and this is established quickly in movie but after that he slumps into a just another movie villain. Taila / Miranda character is never fully explored. Even Wayne/Batman is devoid of any emotions in this one and he feels so sure of himself that I start wondering if it's the same Batman that I saw in first two installments. Only new character which had some shades was that of Selina Kyle and Anne Hathaway did justice to it. Add to that helplessness of Alfred portrayed superbly by Caine. Other actors are good but there's not much for them to do.

There's no dilemma, choices, moral battles, hope, chaos or fear - things that make characters and plot interesting and which made Batman Begins and The Dark Knight really good movies. Even the theme of ""Occupy WallStreet"" is very weak and, at best, is closer to London riots with its looting and arson. There's even perfect order in Bane's revolution. Movie moves effortlessly from one plot to another and to climax that it become at times predictable.

But maybe Dark Knight Rises was supposed to be like that only and Nolan had too much to deal with in 2.5 hours. And maybe that's the main problem with DKR - too much is going on in the story that it seems crammed at times. And when there are too many characters and so many story arcs, it's tough to do justice to characters and story telling at the same time.

Dark Knight Rises have a good story but lacks strong characters and relies on Inception's style which incidentally differs from style of first two installments of Batman Trilogy.

And for me, soul of Nolan's Batman Series is its strong characters, their underlying emotions and a theme which is much deeper and meaningful than all fight, gadgetry and style. And this is where DKR fails.

6/10."
"Christopher Nolan has outdone himself with this one. At 3.30 in the morning, I was tired. Just getting out of it, I've never been so awake.

Perhaps what set this film apart from his other films was that it had a genuine emotional heartbeat. I felt that this was a flaw of Nolan's other films - the vision of emotion was there, but it was hollow. In this I bought it. I felt it, hero and villain alike.

Christian Bale was typically brilliant as Batman, and I felt that Bruce Wayne was more heavily embraced in this final installment. Bale added emotional depth to the character - a plot point that I think went astray in The Dark Knight - picking up from the development made in Batman Begins.

Tom Hardy as Bane was quite simply, terrifying. No longer a dunderhead ""enforcer"", but one of the criminal masterminds behind ""Gotham's Reckoning"", coupled with a physical dominance strong enough to send shivers down your spine.

Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle defied my expectations. Hands up who was not entirely convinced that that girl from the Princess Diaries could handle an intensely physical role like Catwoman. But here I am, hugely impressed. She added immeasurably to the value of the film.

Marion Cotillard fulfilled the role of Miranda Tate admirably, though I suspect this was the most underdeveloped character of the film - though after watching, I can see why.

The unsung hero of The Dark Knight Rises is Michael Caine as Alfred. A heartfelt performance that helps drive the emotional content of the film, helping Nolan sell his most well-rounded film to date. Caine's performance in both presence and absence.

Special mention goes to Joseph Gordon Levitt, who is consistently proving himself to be a big player in the Hollywood game. His role as officer Blake felt like there could've been more, but it may just have come all a bit much. It was a great performance, and Levitt sunk his teeth into role.

If you can, go see this in IMAX. If any film was to sell the format to skeptics, The Dark Knight Rises would be IT. I'm happy Nolan stuck to his guns and shot in 2D. 3D would have been unnecessary.

I suppose at this point, I have to turn my focus on Nolan. If he ever reads this... aspiring filmmaker to filmmaker, I've never been so envious, jealous in all my life. It's a film that leaves me floundering, wondering what I could possibly do to get anywhere near this ballpark. Well done. I think an Oscar Nomination is in order.

From here, I'm not sure what to expect of the future. Does our imagination carry us forward, or do the studios? Time will tell.

"I had the honor of watching TDKR during a screening and was completely blown away! Christopher Nolan's third film in his Batman trilogy doesn't disappoint. The movie is incredibly well made, its huge production is quite breathtaking to view. This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The movie's score high-lites many of its incredible scenes, and at times, it takes your breath away.

The film featured excellent performances, by all the cast. Christian Bale, as always is great as Batman. Anne Hathaway was completely engrossing, she became ""Catwoman"", just like Michele Pfeiffer did, although their interpretations were very different, both were equally effective. Tom Hardy was the main villain ""Bane"" completely shattered my expectations. One of the best superhero movie villains, I've ever seen. The terror caused by him, is completely believable and quite menacing. Marlion Cotilliard, Michael Cane, Gary Oldman, and others all did well in their respective roles. Now I know most will miss Heath Ledger as the Joker.(I know I do) I hope people don't compare Tom Hardy's performance to Heath Ledger's, its completely unfair and the two characters are very different. Just read the comics.

The colossal size of the film is a spectacle to behold, but surprisingly you don't get lost with all the explosions and extravagant action scenes, like in other films,(AKA Transformers, or POTC.) If one were to gripe, and I suppose there will never be a film made that one cannot find a point at which to grip, it is painfully long running time here. I found myself more worried about the pain in my posterior than the emotional final minutes after almost 3 hours that I had spent in a cramped seat, but that's just how I am. However the ending is just fantastic, so emotional and bring the trilogy to a very satisfying end.

Sorry if I'm being all fan-boyish and kissing this movie's behind, but I really admire it. It may not be among my personal favorites but generally this seems to be the movie event of this year. As a film though, this is amazing. A true lasting legacy in superhero story telling and summer-blockbusters."
"The best thing about this movie is how satisfying it is. It doesn't leave you frustrated or confused. You can't really complain that it didn't explore certain ideas or follow through. By deciding to have an official ending to this trilogy's story, the themes surrounding Batman are very fresh. We don't know where he'll end up. It's not the same old thing about whether he can continue to be Batman or not, which was already getting repetitive in Spider-man 2. The conclusions are not as important as the feelings they invoke as they come about. Nolan is especially good at capturing the complete tension of actually not knowing what will happen and deeply questioning what you *want* to happen and why.

This movie is bigger than the previous two, far more ambitious. There are no obvious annoying weaknesses that usually come with films in general, especially blockbuster action movies. All of Nolan's movies have deep psychological themes and this takes those in another new direction. I thought Inception was hugely original and insightful about the way people think. That level of abstraction and depth is present in this film. Bane bursts into it, his reputation is quickly established. Nolan uses people's expectations and anticipation to the fullest. We are left to wonder about what has happened in the 8 years since the events of The Dark Knight. Why have the characters become the way they are now?

In the latter half, it does seem like the movie is trying to pull off so many different plot points and connections, but they all work. The cast is very large and impressive. You don't see ""good acting"". You see fascinating characters. They're just playing their part in the grand story that's being crafted. There are many unfamiliar faces but they all have a strange, unique look to them. We often see a person's flaws and previous decisions coming back to haunt them. They find out the hard way what mistakes they have made. Where their limits are. Where they lose control.

The score is almost tribal, very raw and energetic. You don't get much chance to pay attention to it but many parts of the movie are pounding with excitement. There are countless quotable lines and disturbing slices of dialogue. They cut deep. The Joker was a great character and this is a very different movie but the themes are just as dark, only perhaps indirectly. Underneath, it's very sinister. Writing and efficiency appear to be among Nolan's greatest strengths. The story has many layers that interweave and apparently they came in under budget.

Perhaps the most important thing about Catwoman is that she's completely believable. When she beats up men, you don't roll your eyes. She's feminine and powerful in her own way. She fits into the world and we completely understand her motivations. She doesn't have a huge role but a very important one.

I didn't find myself moved but maybe I'm too cynical. I was more affected psychologically. Curious about humanity and all the different sides of it you see in this movie. It goes to many extremes. I felt humbled by my complete lack of life experience. What do I know about anything? How could I possibly understand half of the characters? I haven't been through anything or achieved anything compared to most of them. Michael Caine gets a bigger role this time. He was always critical but this time he's very much the emotional core.

I thought Christian Bale was overlooked in The Dark Knight especially. The movies hinge on him. Bruce Wayne's just a man but also incredibly inspirational. Bale's famous for completely committing to his roles and it pays off. Tom Hardy is impressive as Bane but I suppose that's no surprise. The rest of the leads are similarly awesome. There are many references to the earlier films. Very few questions are left unanswered. It's always nice when film-makers really think it through and make an actual decision and get all the details right.

So anyway, I'll miss Batman (since the trilogy has ended) but couldn't have hoped for a better, more epic and sincere finale to his story."
"The Batman series by Christopher Nolan was and is probably one of the best superhero series ever. In an industry where very few sequels have been that good, The Dark Knight, I believe was designed by Christopher Nolan to be head and shoulders above Batman Begins; and it was. The Dark Knight surpassed Batman Begins, end of story. Now that you have accomplished what very few have managed, how do you surpass this one. A daunting and mountainous task indeed. Only now, Nolan wasn't even trying to surpass it. He was merely trying to present a movie that would build on its predecessor.

The movie is set 8 years after the Joker incident so that anything related to the Joker need not be shown (RIP Heath Ledger). Nolan presents us a completely different Gotham. A different take on it. And how 8 years can change people. How the harvey dent and joker incident can affect people and batman himself. In a time of peace, it is quite easy to plan and attack even an entire city. Everything is taken into concern. And it all adds up to one seemingly invincible villain. The logic is never lost at any point of time. The screenplay is penned to allow the impact of what has happened to Gotham and its people in ""The Dark Knight"" and what could happen if something goes wrong now.

All things said, if you are expecting something better than The Dark Knight, you are mistaken. This was never going to compete or surpass that. This is a very good movie in its own right. As for the series, there cannot be a better conclusion and I really hope nobody else continues this series if Nolan decides not to.

TDKR needs to be appreciated for staying true to its roots and still giving us something good, exhilarating and unexpected."
"There are plenty of elements that made this film work, so I suppose we can tick them off one by one. For starters, the continuation on the focus of Bruce Wayne's story, which has made it all tick. This version of Bruce Wayne and Alfred become the familiar characters we're accustomed with since 2005, and the film invests heavily on the emotional bonding between the two, which deals back to the theme about fear that rears its ugly head again, and how a father figure cannot stand idly by to watch the one he brought up recklessly charge into battle after a long hiatus, and hoping for a life of normalcy with the mantle of the bat given up. Michael Caine may have a shorter screen time than before, but no less powerful.

When Sam Raimi had to put the popular and powerful Venom into Spider-man 3 pretty much against his wishes, we all knew how that turned out to be, effectively killing off the franchise until the decision to reboot it. There may be some similar fears with the introduction of a fairly contemporary villain in Bane, but the story gave him more purpose and meaning, and Tom Hardy was excellent par none in this role as the compete villain - with plenty of brawn, merciless, masterful, and with a plan any terrorist would be proud of. If the Scarecrow meant to induce fear, and the Joker to create chaos, Bane is carnage incarnate. Tom Hardy, even being the requisite mask, is fearful, and while the designs of his plan may dwarf the Joker's in complexity, it sure rivaled his in terms of delivery, and execution. Anyone in his path gets shoved aside with deadly consequences, and anyone alive is only because there is of further use. No hesitation, and no compromise.

And Nolan continues with the introduction of a lot more villains big and small, behind a mask or otherwise, in his Bat films than anyone would credit him for, especially when having those whose lines are blurred, or corrupt to the core and hiding behind social status and fortune. This in turn provides for another arc that boils underneath the main narrative, where the rich and powerful continue to enjoy their successes at the expense of the have-nots, and the Occupy Movement in a way being a very real parallel to the proceedings on screen. While the mobsters were clearly at the top of the food chain in the earlier Nolan films, this one shifted focus to politicians and the elite community, with their fair share of scandals and corporate greed.

While Bane was to the point, Selina Kyle played by Anne Hathaway, is both sensual and a force to be reckoned with herself, being like how she's best portrayed, on the fence. There's a bit of Frank Miller's Year One in this one given the presence of Juno Temple's Holly, and the back to basics as a jewel thief, compared to the mousy secretary in Tim Burton's Batman Returns with Michelle Pfeiffer defining the role, and the garbage that was Halle Berry's. Anne Hathaway nailed this one with what would be a truly memorable outing, and as if a homage of sorts to Burton's second Batman film, that the repartee between Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle at a party became one of the highlights here, as does her thievery and combat ability. She may lack her whip, but more than makes up for it with her steel stiletto heels, and the very sensual and sleekly designed feline moves that you'd wonder how they got delivered while wrapped under that skin tight suit.

And not only is the technology put on screen fictionally impressive, the technical aspects behind the scenes also worked wonders, chalking up serious mileage in having more than an hour's worth of footage shot on the IMAX format. Wally Pfister's cinematography continues to impress with that staying consistent to the gritty look and feel developed for all the Bat films to date, before his departure into a film director's role for his next project. Hans Zimmer also probably developed the best score for Nolan's Bat films, and I dare say without which this film would be less stellar, with the score playing a huge role in adding plenty of character and emotion to the film, lifting it up with excitement during the many set action pieces, with recognizable themes assigned to major players, heightening dangers, and providing a boost to the many feelings in this one heck of an action-adventure.

With how things developed at the end, and what I felt was initial horror of sorts with Batman out in broad daylight, secret identity being porous and all, this film ended in what would be the best way possible - with possibilities, and a twinkle of an eye, Inception style with a did it, or did it not. Twists, turns, surprises and sleight of hand, making it a clear favourite as one of the best this year. Do yourself a favour and watch it in the IMAX format, just as it was intended.

Because you have just got to believe in Christopher Nolan, and the kind of films he has so far delivered. Take a bow, bat-crew, for a trilogy that has now set the bar for any comic book film, and especially any other follow Batman movie, reboot or otherwise, to live up to."
"I'm going to start off by saying that this was probably one of my most anticipated movies of all time. I went in the theater hoping for a masterpiece. I actually expected this movie to jump into my top five of all time. It didn't disappoint, I loved it.

The opening scene had me questioning what exactly was going on. Movies that make you think about the smallest details of the plot are my favorite. In the scene the audience is introduced to the new villain, Bane. As a kid watching cartoons I always thought that bane was a mindless hulk-like bad guy. In this movie he has a true to the comic's portrayal. He's smart, he has a plan, and he'll stop at nothing to put it into action. Much like Dark Knight, the Villain is a major standout. He has such an intimidating presence on screen. Tom Hardy put so much work into the physicality of the character. The first fight between Bane and Batman is one of the moments that they had to get right. Luckily it's one of my favorite moments in the entire film! In the scene they don't use too much sound, just Bane's taunts as he fights, truly frightening. His voice is so interesting. It's something you'll really remember about the film. After the film my friends and I couldn't help but do Bane impressions. He has so many quotable lines that he will probably be one of my favorite villains of all time. You might be wondering if he outperformed the Joker from Dark Knight. The answer is no, not quite. He's so different of a character it's hard to compare, but Joker was just too hard to beat. Christian Bale's performance as Batman and Bruce Wayne was amazing. This was easily his best performance as Batman. The story takes place eight years after the end of Dark Knight so Bruce is feeling the ill effects of being batman. He uses a cane now, and he has a little grey hair. This is a story about Bruce Wayne coming back, and doing anything he can for his city. Bruce and Alfred have some amazing scenes where you forget your watching acting. The emotion they both convey when they're together is stunning. Michel Cane doesn't have as much screen time as he does in the other movies, but he's so good in the ones he's in you won't forget his performance. Morgan Freeman is back. He has some particularly funny scenes with Bruce. They feel like old friends yet again. You really can't go wrong with any of the actors in this movie. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays young police officer Blake. He has some great character development during the course of the movie. I was cheering for him the whole time. If you come out of this movie saying ""I just wish it had better acting"" I'd question your sanity. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman was one big worry I had about the movie going in. Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised. She did a great job of portraying the playful vigilante. She actually had okay chemistry with Christian Bale. Catwoman wasn't forced into the story, her character made sense within the plot. She didn't ruin the movie, which was all I was asking for. Plus, she actually looked like she could fight. She wasn't doing the ""I'm a woman who can beat up ten men with one hand tied behind my back"" routine. It was such a relief that they didn't try to do something annoying like Black Widow from Avengers.

The story was fantastic. It's amazing that Christopher Nolan wasn't planning on doing this movie before he made Batman Begins. There are so many callbacks and references to that movie I would strongly recommend watching that one again before you see this one. I kept saying ""Oh I remember when he said that!"" or thinking ""That ties in perfectly"". This one had plenty of twists and turns. Multiple times I was questioning what was true and what was a clever ruse. If there are any negatives, you might say there are some plot leaps. Not holes mind you, but something upon thinking about it you might consider a little unbelievable. With such huge story and scope I'm surprised there aren't more mistakes. The scale of this movie is far bigger than in either of the first two Batman movies. Bane has a plan for all of Gotham and batman has to stop an entire city of villains. The entire trilogy comes to a very fitting finish. I absolutely loved the ending. I was very satisfied how everything tied together. I especially loved the conclusion of Bruce's story, perfect. When I came out of the theater I couldn't wait to discuss the amazing things that happened in the end. This is a movie where the more you watch it the more you'll understand and enjoy it.

Of course, in the conclusion to a trilogy like this one you would expect to be dazzled by the special effects. They were quite impressive. The new batwing has some pretty amazing aerial maneuvers. You definitely get your money's worth with the cinematography. The opening and ending scenes especially stand out. There was an extremely cool Bat Pod driving scene that, as soon as it was over, I wanted to watch it again.

It can't tell you enough that this was an amazing movie. It was certainly the best of the year. If you're wondering if it's better than The Dark Knight I honestly can't say. Time will tell. It could be better, and that's some of the highest praise I can give it.

Edit: Time did tell. It didn't hold up. Still good. Nowhere near Dark Knight tkubas1.wordpress.com."
"'The Dark Knight Rises' is the third and final instalment in Christopher Nolan's groundbreaking trilogy that reshaped the superhero genre as we know it. The main cast return as well as some newcomers. Tom Hardy as 'Bane', Anne Hathaway as 'Selina', Joseph Gordon-Levitt as 'Blake' and Marion Cotillard as 'Miranda'. The new additions are fantastic, especially Tom Hardy. He brings a menacing presence to the character and finally incorporates the main part of his comic counterpart, his brains. For sure Bane is incredibly strong, but he is also an unbelievable strategist that can systematically wear down Batman whilst also using his strength to defeat him. Hardy displays all of this perfectly despite us barely seeing his face, the mask he wears makes him more frightening and is used as an interesting plot device later in the film. A lot of people criticised the voice that Hardy uses for this character, but personally I love it, I think adds to the mystery of the figure. The best acting comes from Michael Caine as 'Alfred Pennyworth'. Nolan really fleshes out Alfred and Bruce's relationship in this film and Caine plays the reluctant mentor figure perfectly. One of his final scenes really shows off his acting, the regret that Alfred pours out and it's heartbreaking. Whilst all of the other actors are great, Caine excels in this movie compared to 'Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight'. The writing is brilliant, so many twists and turns and a sensational ending that really brings the trilogy full circle and has a great ending to Bruce's arc. The dialogue is excellent, in particular the many Bane monologues that add another layer onto his great character. The fight choreography improves massively and is loads better than the last two films. Hanz Zimmers score is superb and works in all scenes that it features in. Also, the cinematography is beautiful, Wally Pfister, who has worked with Nolan throughout the trilogy, really peaks in this picture. However, this movie isn't perfect, Bane's final demise is very underwhelming, especially for a character that makes as much of an impact as he does. Finally the twist at the end with Blake feels tacked on and is inaccurate to the source material. Overall, I love this movie, for sure it doesn't live up to the heights of 'The Dark Knight' but it is still exceptional and was a stunning way to end this unbelievable series of films.

9/10"
"Let me start by saying, that I am an avid Nolan admirer. Up until now I haven't seen a bad Nolan film. All of his movies would be in my top movies list if I had one, I consider him a genius. After seeing the final act of his Batman I have started to reconsider.

The movie was filled with moments where I found myself thinking ""This is not believable"" and after the first hour I asked myself ""Is this it?"". Gladly after the first hour things did become more meaningful. The ""fall"" of the dark knight was awesome, Bane was a tough guy and the Batman did suffer. It was great. Even Anne Hathaway came trough crushing all my negative preconceptions. Other than that, the movie certainly didn't deliver.

In the end they ruined Banes character. Batman's training in this film was far from believable. There were lot of little stories and story structures going on, which didn't work when added together. I mean they worked but comparing to the previous films of Nolan they certainly did not deliver. In many scenes I thought ""This is something that just could not happen"", the things in this film just didn't work. And I don't mean Batman doing his stunts, of course they are unrealistic, I mean all the little things that left me bothered.

On the other hand when it comes to Batman's stunts there were little, the end conclusion left me thinking ""was this the great finale of BATMAN?"". Isn't Batman supposed to do something cooler than fly a plane or ride a motorcycle? Isn't Batman supposed to be an acrobat who beats everyone in a cool, cunning and mysterious ways? Here he was the operator of an army plane. In the previous films he was Batman, in this film he doesn't really come off as Batman. His only a random commando wearing a Batman suit. This is something I could not forgive Nolan for.

If the scenes we're actually believable I would've propably considered forgiving him this error, but these two errors together are just too much for me to say this is an impressive movie. You might be able to go as far to say this is good, but it is not impressive. This is a shame, because the guy who did this has done nothing but impressive movies. For some other director this movie could be a good stepping stone for something better, an acceptable movie that did have its moments, but for Nolan it is an utter failure. There we're times in this movie when he got me and I was impressed. The movie did in certain scenes raise my emotion and hit me where it should've, but as a whole taking into account all the bad things it cannot be regarded as a movie above others.

I was let down with this movie. With all of his previous movies that I have seen in the theathre I have gone in with enormous expectations, like the kind of hyped mind you should never walk in with and every single time I have walked out with my expectations blown away by the grandness of what I have just seen. This time I walked in with the same expectations and came out disappointed. The only question in my mind being ""How was he able to not see these flaws in this movie, I thought he was a genius who could not fail""."
"This movie shows that despite failure, despite your fears, despite your enemies, you can be a hero. you can use all three of those things to your advantage and become something better than you were before you encountered them. it masterfully shows and tells that ANYONE can be a hero.

obviously on a technical level this film is perfect. almost the entirety of the third act is shot in beautiful imax, that's sadly only in 16:9 on 4K. just like with the previous transfers, sound and picture are great, but this is probably the best looking film to me.

it may not seem like it at first, but just like ra's and joker, bane is the opposite side of the same coin for batman. tom hardy perfectly embodies bane and the darkness, and obviously he's a downgrade from joker, but that doesn't mean he's not the perfect villain for a finale.

hans zimmer delivers probably my third favorite score from him, with an incredible theme for bane as well as many extensions of previous themes.

this is such an underrated finale. all three films mesh together so well, they feel like one. they mean so much to me, and i'll forever thank nolan for making these films."
"I've always loved superhero movies and as a kid Batman was my favourite superhero and I collected as many of the comic books as I could possibly afford.

Saying that I've never expected a superhero movie to be between the best genres of movies that I would ever watch. I just expect them to be entertaining and something fun to watch. I watch most of them; Superman, Spiderman, Ironman, X-men etc.

I expected the same this time but I was knocked off my feet. The actors, the storyline, the manuscript and the filming just came together as one of the best movies I've ever seen. This movie has really brilliant and powerful dialogues.

If you haven't seen it yet then I can strongly recommend it. I will definitely see it again with a good bottle of wine and popcorn. Enjoy!"
"Christopher Nolan's stunning conclusion to his Batman trilogy is a welcome return to form after the slightly overrated THE DARK KNIGHT, which was so obsessed with being all dark and brooding that it forgot to tell much of a story. Despite the presence of a much-hyped (and lamented) Heath Ledger in the cast, I found that film to be less entertaining than BATMAN BEGINS although it still remains an engaging and watchable film. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES (horrible title, by the way), though, blows it out of the water, offering a piece of sheer spectacle that's as involving and as tightly-plotted as you could wish for.

It's eight years since the last film, and Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne is nowadays retired and definitely feeling his age. Before long, though, a hulking brute of a bad guy (Tom Hardy, whose sheer physicality in the role will surprise nobody who's seen Bronson) decides to do some very unpleasant things in the city, so it's time to dust off the bat suit and get back into the action. Good news for the viewer.

As usual, Nolan surpasses the conventions of his genre, making this a superhero film that looks nothing like a superhero film, instead more like a modern-day epic of dramatic cinema. Yes, at the end of the day it's still about suited guys beating the hell out of each other, and Nolan once again relies on old conventions/clichés (such as the 'ticking bomb' trope, which he's repeated in his last three films now) to see him through, but everyone runs so well and so smoothly that you end up not minding.

The cast is thorough and involved as ever, Bale as usual going the extra mile to portray the tortured hero and Caine lending emotional support as Alfred. Hardy's villain is a sheer powerhouse who dominates every scene he's in, and Nolan brings back a couple of his favourites from INCEPTION (Marion Cotillard and Joseph Gordon-Levitt) for good measure. There's not quite as much action as you might expect from a film of this type, but the storyline is so involved that you don't care. Throw plenty of stunning special effects into the mix and you have a real crowd-pleaser of a film with real brain as well as brawn."
"Chris Nolan has r-e-a-l-l-y outdone himself again this time. An amazing story that I don't even know who else could write such a treatment on the World's Greatest Detective, the crowning glory of Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy.

I remember I once made a joke to myself a long while ago about him that if he was going to make another movie, he would probably cast Heath Ledger and Joseph Gordon-Levitt's respective love interests from a movie of which they BOTH starred in and worked on-- 10 Things I Hate About You.

It would be ironically funny how both actors are connected to each other from working at different times with the ""holy-moly mind-blowing"" filmmaker and that the actresses that played their love interests would possibly too as well."
"I'll be brutally honest here. I liked The Dark Knight better than this. Even though its just couple of hours since I finished watching it.

Sure, TDK had its flaws, but then, it was such a marvelous noir saga, a treatise in crime drama that left us begging for more at the end. The phrase ""page-turner"" is often applied to engrossing books, but that could work just as well for the magnificent film. To this day, I cannot take my eyes off whenever I see TDK and by the time that ravishing interrogation scene between Batman and Joker is on, nothing is likely to stir me from my seat. By choosing to make the titular character undergo a perception shift, a massive (and ultimately successful) gamble was taken. And who can forget the late, great Heath Ledger's spectacular performance?

TDKR is not a bad movie per se. Seen alone, it has the ideal ingredients for a summer blockbuster: an A-list cast, monumental action sequences, modern themes of terrorism and official ineptitude, as well as intricate sub-plots which mesh well together at the end. There is more than a passing reference to the predecessors, especially Batman Begins (which, in my humble opinion, is an enormously underrated flick). And it works to a great extent.

Where this film fails as TDK succeeded is in the amount of layering. Some sub-plots were so complex that I was left confused as to where I was before that particular sequence (case in point: Blake's impromptu reconnaissance of a dockyard). Others were left frustratingly hanging in thin air. The plot also seems slow paced at first. While the first sequence is downright awesome, what follows afterward is distinctly underwhelming. Above all else, Batman is renowned to be a master strategist. Here, he ends up getting deceived not once, but twice at Catwoman's hands. You mean to tell me that eight years is good enough to make a superbly trained, marine-worthy, genius escape artist-cum-detective become dull? Really?

I won't go ahead and slate Nolan more here, simply because he gave me the privilege of watching two of the best superhero movies ever filmed in Batman Begins and TDK. The glass is always half-full in my eyes, and I'll admit that Hathaway and Gordon-Levitt were both perfect selections for their roles. I'm not too sure of Tom Hardy, since his performance is more physical than metaphorical but given his task was to exude a ruthless menace, he did his job. The rest of the familiar supporting cast are brilliant as before, especially with Caine showing his human side that we always suspected was well alive beneath that stiff British upper lip exterior and dry wit. I read somewhere that this is not a Batman movie, but a Bruce Wayne movie. And I fully agree. Having to reconcile (with unflattering results) with a life without Batman, Bruce is alone even as a social presence and a corporate figure. It is a true challenge but then again, Christian Bale turned in a remarkable performance in both BB and TDK (he held his own in those scenes where Ledger was not present). And in TDKR, he leaves an indelible mark on a role that would probably be the benchmark.

Batman Begins was all about ""Fear"" while ""Chaos"" was a running theme in TDK. TDKR does a great job in being a conclusion to the trilogy, but it is not the best one among the three, probably because there is no strong undercurrent of a theme here."
"I am a huge fan of Christopher Nolan and the first 2 Dark Knight movies, so I had high expectations for this movie. The Dark Knight Rises is good, but it is nowhere near the level of the other two movies. It has several things that are a bit cliché and it also had several plot holes that I found very irritating and distracting. My friend who I saw it with initially thought it was the best out of the trilogy, but after we discussed the plot holes that he missed, he ranked it as the worst of the three movies. Throughout the movie I felt like everything was a bit overdone. It seemed like they were trying so hard to make the ""epic conclusion"" that they forgot to make it realistic or reasonable. One of the things I loved about the first two was how it dealt with Batman in a fairly realistic way. There was a fairly good overview of how he functioned and how he was viewed. In this I thought there was much less dealing with the separation of Bruce Wayne and Batman, which was one of the interesting parts of the first 2. Also, I would describe the main character of The Dark Knight Rises as Bruce Wayne rather than Batman, which I found greatly disappointing. Still a good movie, but not nearly as great as the first 2."
"-Minor Spoilers- First of all, why hate so much? The movie is not perfect, agreed. It's not the best movie ever, again agreed. However it's one of the best movies, and it's pretty damn good, even if it's not perfect. The plot is good, the action is good, cast is great, acting is great too, and the atmosphere the movie creates is fantastic! Ignore all the hate, and please go enjoy the film. And I don't understand, why are people comparing this movie to TDK? They're by the same director and they're part of the same trilogy, no comparison. TDK is too perfect, and we all know that. So why did ya all have your expectations sky high. Whenever a director releases a movie which is near-perfect, then it is hard for him/her to beat that movie. Sure he/she can make a movie equal to the other one, but to beat it, think again. Thus my expectations for TDKR were high, but not sky high. And guess what? It crossed my expectations, and it was really close to TDK. Tremendous film!

Lately I haven't developed an interest in comic book reading, and I really don't enjoy batman or to be honest I don't enjoy much of superhero films at all. Only a few. However I didn't only enjoy this movie as a superhero film, I also enjoyed it itself as a movie. The reason I don't watch many superhero films is because they're very tedious and repetitive, and there's no message. Here is how your everyday superhero film goes ""There is ""Whatever"" man. Some stupid person attempts to outsmart the _____man, and take over the city, and guess what? He fails, and ______ man gets respect for saving the city...the end"". TDKR was out of the ordinary. To be honest, the whole trilogy was ""Out of the box"" thinking, especially this and TDK. Both this and TDK made it to my Top 10 films of all-time, and many movies at this time don't even make it close.

The movie did have its problems as well, it was not perfect. One of the major concerns was the time. The movie had a near-3hr run time which was more than enough. There were some slow and boring parts at the beginning and middle of the film, but as the movie approached the ending, none of this really mattered. Also I didn't really like how Bane died. He was really bad-ass up until the end, where Catwoman whipped him out in 1 second. I was expecting another fight between Batman and Bane, only to find out something else? It was too fast of a death, and not only that, he was the villain of the film, how can you kill a villain in 1 second? And it was not even Batman who killed him, it was Catwoman? I personally wasn't expecting this at all.

-Major Spoilers- The movie really kept you glued to the screen near the end. I really liked the plot twists and never expected some of them. Though some were predictable, but others weren't, IMO. For example, Batman surviving, and Talia escaping from the prison rather than Bane was pretty unpredictable. On the other hand, John Black turning out to be Robin, and Miranda Tate turning out to be Talia al Ghul was more predictable. I think there were some more plot twists, but I can't really remember, because I saw the full movie once, and that was 3 months back.

At first I thought Bane was the one who escaped from the prison, and was the son of Henri Ducard, but it turned out that it was Talia, and Bane was just a friend. This was the real shocker for me. I didn't really care much for the other plot twists, but this really shook me hard. I never expected this, in fact I even forgot about this up until the end. Also batman surviving? This was the second most unpredictable twist. At first I thought just maybe he survived, but after the funeral, I was sure that he was dead. Then he appears in Florence? This was pretty shocking as well.

The second half of the film was the best, because that's when the excitement began. I was very curious about what was going to happen next. After the explosion scenes, the suspense began to rise rapidly. Then the climax came all together very nicely.

My favourite parts of the film in the first half were the opening ""Plane Hijack"" scene, the ""Stock Exchange"" scene, and ""Bane vs Batman"" fight 1. In the second half my favourite scenes were the ""Football explosion"" scene, ""Bane vs Batman"" fight 2, and the final chase scene. Some of the other fight scenes involving Catwoman and Robin were pretty good too.

Final thoughts, I didn't expect much of this movie after TDK. TDK was perfect, and I thought this movie would be no where close, but it was pretty damn close. It was really good too. The action was great. The cast, acting, and dialogue were all fantastic. Especially the dialogue between Alfred and Bruce. Gary Oldman did a great job, not to mention that Joseph Gordon-Levitt did an amazing job as well. Tom Hardy turned out to be a great villain. Even though Bane's voice was kind of confusing, but it was pretty cool. Overall the whole movie includes some great action scenes, and runs a full circle completing TDK legend in an Epic way!

Final Rating 9/10."
"Christopher Nolan has out done himself again, striking not just Batman fans, but fans of the series and movie goers everywhere with his beautifully crafted, last installment of The Dark Knight trilogy, The Dark Knight Rises. The acting has always been well done in the last two, but something about the last one really made me feel the performances were real, quite like the late Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker. The movie ran about two hours and forty-five minutes give or take, but I never wanted it to end. The story progression never seemed to drag on, the movie always kept me on the edge of my seat. This is one that will be an all time favorite of mine, and a true classic.

"I can't express in words of how amazing this movie is. All I have to say is go watch it for yourself.the is really the best,don't get me wrong i enjoyed the others but this one truly takes the cake!I said before batman begins is the best film i had ever seen without any exception. However viewing the 2005 Christopher Nolan production, I was pleasantly shocked. Then after my huge expectations for, ""The Dark Knight"", Christopher Nolan blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, ""The Dark Knight Rises""? Quite simply, Yes! My big expectations were once again, blown away. What a production! This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The editing, sound, score, visuals, direction and action are all top notch.I am wholly satisfied with Christopher Nolan's vision and thank all who worked on this film for bringing such an intricate interpretation of its very famous literary source.a big kiss for Christian Bale and Anne Hathaway i really love them.if i visit USA this will be for visit Christian Bale and Anne Hathaway. thanks for all."
"Christopher Nolan was assigned with the job of coming out with a new Batman movie comparable to The Dark Knight. Did he succeed? In short, yes. Is it better than The Dark Knight? No. But is it incredible, awesome, and everything we could have hoped for? Yes. This movie would be the best Batman movie and even one of the best movies ever if Heath Ledger wouldn't have put on the face paint. That's what I think is the biggest difference between the movies. While Tom Hardy's Bane is very very well done and flat out frightening at times, nobody can top Ledger's Joker. But don't think for a second that TDKR is any worse because of that.

The Dark Knight Rises brings the biggest threat of all three movies to Gotham in the form of Bane. Bane is Batman's biggest threat he's ever had physically and forces Bruce Wayne to return as Batman after entering an isolated state. Much less happens in this movie than in the previous two and I think it's because of the villains. In Batman Begins, Batman had to fight the Mob, Scarecrow, and Ras Al Ghul. In The Dark Knight, Batman had to fight the Mob, The Joker, and Two-Face. In The Dark Knight Rises, Batman has to fight Bane, and only Bane. From beginning to end, all Batman has to do is figure out how to defeat Bane and stop him from finishing his evil plot. While Batman Begins is some what lessened in genius because it has to tell the origin story of Batman, and The Dark Knight is just obviously amazing to everyone who sees it, The Dark Knight Rises has more of a hidden genius. Most people will miss all the symbols and why this movie is so brilliant and such a masterful ending to the Dark Knight's Legacy.

There's so much I wish I can say, but I don't want to spoil it for you. All I should say is see it. See it and be amazed by it. 10 Stars out of 10."
Gotham's reckoning.Well TDKR the last installment of the Nolan's Batman series ended in the perfect note the way trilogies are a supposed to end the real trilogy. So whats so great about this movie? This movie has it own moments when you get the chills on several occasions about whats is going to happen next it is almost breathtaking.Brilliant performances by all the actors in the movie.Hans Zimmer did it again by making the perfect score for the movie which will glue you to the seat and a wonderful plot which brings justice to the entire series. But but there is a but there are a few things which i felt should have been how it was which I am not going to mention because this needs to be a spoiler free review and i want it to be but this movie is worth every penny. Is this movie better than The Dark Knight? Well to that I have to think about it I cant sum up to the conclusion yet but again for me Batman Begins revolves around Batman The Dark Knight about the people of Gotham TDKR well why are you still reading this go watch it for yourself as i said it was worth every dime ...
"As a huge fan of superhero movies and undeniably the batman Christopher Nolan has depicted is the favourite of my choice. He is humane yet enigmatic, heroic and self-giving. Chris Nolan has produced superhero movies into a whole different level. The action, acting, sound and other visual effects was absolutely mind-blowing for the previous two productions. He is good at picking the right cast playing the right role like Michael Caine, Gary Oldham and Morgan Freeman who have always been the linchpin behind the success of the movie. I am also in awe of his previous works excluding the batman series such as Momento and The Prestige. So I had high hope and expectation on the Dark Knight Rises of how the director can build up the finale of the Batman trilogy which the world has long anticipated this blockbuster.

Judged by the content of the trailers, lots of people might expect it to be an action intensive film with lots of explosive elements and the elemental conflict between good and evil. If I'm honest, I have already seen most of the action scenes of the movie via the trailers before watching the film which is a saddening thing to hear from an audience's point of view. The entire film was almost three hours long and there were way too much chit chatting with the whole conspiracy by the villain but not getting down into the main point or the action bits. I think those scenes about having trials on the people by the judge whether they were guilty or not was plainly farcical in my opinion and quite cheesy which I never experienced in the previous two batman films.

The Dark Knight Rises has put in a lot of new characters who played a key role in the film including Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing John Blake and Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate. But the main villain, Bane played by Tom Hardy made me anticipated on how he can use his eyes as his weapon to proceed the acting, to show his wrath towards the corrupted society. I must say I was a bit disappointed at the villain role as the joker simply played too well in The Dark Knight in which Tom Hardy could not exceed the expectation. With those prestigious casts which all of them are great actors, I expected that it would be a sensational experience crafted by those actors. However, the entire film always talking about bits and bobs and never really get to one main theme. The experience was messy and too stuffed in without much focus to cause the audience to fall into the frictional world that Christopher Nolan was trying to present.

In conclusion, The Dark Knight Rises does not exceed my expectation nor better than the predecessor. I thought it was a let down the way how Christopher Nolan wrap up this impeccable Batman series. I only gave the rating 7/10 because of the two fantastic previous productions he made."
"The Dark Knight Rises (2012) The crusader in the mask For the last few years cinematography and special effects took a big step in improving the quality of their own products. That's why every new film set the bar higher and higher, therefor competition is rising. However, this is what exactly people want. Today once again saw this movie and decided to share my point of view, because while it is almost 3 years old, nevertheless with every time watching this film is no less mesmerizing.

In my opinion the plot of the third part surpassed even the second with loved by all great Heath Ledger as the Joker. It is very interesting and confusing, and if the beginning of the film (as is a rule in the case with Cristofer Nolan) is pretty tight, by the end of it is already impossible to put down. Eight years after the events of the previous part Gotham lives in piece and silence. Police Commissioner James Gordon feels guilty about covering up Harvey Dant's crimes and Dark Knight's disappearing because of that. However, events occurring in the city for the last days cry for help the hero, as well as the beauty who has got into trouble – Cat Woman. So Batman dares to speak out against the main villain – Bane. Christopher Nolan - a man who showed how the movie can be removed on comics. Already, it makes him one of the best producers nowadays. As he said, for the first Batman movie the main theme was ""fear"", for the second - ""chaos"", for the last - ""pain"". This pain is more soulful and Bruce Wayne will feel it completely.

Christian Bale – a man always on his top. For the late 80's and 90's kids he will always be the Dark Knight. Christian Bale is my Batman. He is my hero.

Anne Hathaway - a perfect Cat Woman. She is my favorite actress and she didn't disappoint me. It costs a lot. Joseph Gordon-Levitt played the role of energetic young cop - Blake. It seems this guy have a bright future, because Joseph is showing cool actor's skills. Morgan Freeman,

Gary Oldman and Michael Caine showed that ""old"" doesn't mean ""bad"". An incredible full compliance with the allotted roles. Soundtrack. «Basara Deshi» permeates the entire history by becoming the theme both for Bane and Batman.

I can say with certainty that the film was a success. Nice plot and amazing special effects because of the big budget are doing their job. Strong main villain who are all the time winning good guys causes the audience worry and fear. However, like rays are trying to break through the clouds, good is trying to break through. All this and beautiful Anne Hathaway don't give the audience to look away from the screen. Many of the best characters in the Batman universe, as if in a mirror, reflect the character of the protagonist, or when walking on the razor's edge between justice and revenge, or when caught in a trap of injuries in the past. Loyal fans of comics hardly surprised many plot twists, which is quite natural if we remember how the story developed in detail. For truly impressive how Nolan and his co-authors-screenwriter David S. Goyer and Jonathan Nolan managed to finish the trilogy of Batman. The film seems to be more emotional than the second part with it's psychological games. Of course, it has a lot of drama and even tragedy as well, but ""Dark Knight Rises"" touches the most. This large-scale painting, remaining harmonious, with great music and very beautiful camera work. However, the scope and action, going beyond imagination, leads to the fact that the scene, each of which is costs more than the budget of any other film, are perceived as ordinary events, while Bruce Wayne looks better in private moments, whether it's the episode where one of the characters finally realizes who is actually a man- bat, or the scene with the advent of a new character. Also there is a problem with the female audience understanding the reality of the plot, because there a lot of moments related to the previous parts. For example, such an important character of the first part and Batman story as Ras'el'Gul, whose name was named in a few episodes of the movie. Everyone should see this picture, are you a child or adult, it does not matter whether you love comics knight in black armor or you don't. Everyone who will leave the cinema will be inspired by something. Your brain processes speed up and you will feel strong and ready for new challenges. No matter where you are, who you are, when you are. What is important is that the message is delivered to you and it's your business what to do with it. Nolan and Co. did what they wanted to do. Created a symbol. Created a hero. My hero.

Score: 10 out of 10 Batmans"
"A feline fingerer has taken to your pearls, although identity's the intent of this girl, as she initiates engagement, allows the stirring of assuagement, the final chapter is prepared, starts to unfurl. A villain name of Bane brings down an empire, an exchange leads to a tomb, so deep and dire, a saviour's weaponised, the population terrorised, Ra's al Ghul's destructive end, is the desire. But there are those who can align and form resistance, as you recover your resolve and your persistence, as the endgame twists and turns, a web of intrigue is discerned, and you race to save the day and create distance."
"There's a common misconception when it comes to The Dark Knight Rises especially regarding how it tackles it's themes and story: this film isn't trying to raise the stakes, it's trying to add to the story, in this case his loneliness, his sense of powerlessness.

Hans Zimmer's score is some of the best I've ever heard, Wally Pfister peaked, had the best choreographed action scenes out of the whole trilogy, had the most emotionally resonant story out of the trilogy for sure. A very well made and satisfying conclusion that makes this trilogy one of the best .. ever?

A perfect comic book movie, certainly one of my favourites of all time"
"Christopher Nolan's *The Dark Knight Rises* serves as a powerful conclusion to his acclaimed Batman trilogy, delivering a breathtaking blend of action, emotion, and thematic depth that elevates the superhero genre. Set eight years after the events of *The Dark Knight*, Gotham City is in a state of uneasy peace, and Bruce Wayne, portrayed masterfully by Christian Bale, is a shadow of his former self. The film adeptly explores themes of redemption, resilience, and sacrifice, leaving viewers contemplating the complexities of heroism.

Nolan's direction is impeccable, capturing the grandeur and scale of Gotham in its darkest hour. The cinematography is striking, with sweeping shots that enhance the film's epic scope. The supporting cast, including Tom Hardy as the formidable Bane and Anne Hathaway as the enigmatic Selina Kyle, add depth and intrigue to the narrative. Hardy's portrayal of Bane is particularly noteworthy, bringing a physicality and menace that challenges Batman in unexpected ways.

The film's pacing is engaging, interspersing intense action sequences with moments of quiet reflection, allowing the audience to connect with the characters' struggles. The score, once again composed by Hans Zimmer, elevates the experience, underscoring the emotional stakes of the story.

Overall, *The Dark Knight Rises* is a triumphant conclusion that brings closure to Bruce Wayne's journey. It masterfully balances thrilling action with profound character development, solidifying its place as a modern cinematic classic. Fans of the genre and newcomers alike will find themselves captivated by this ambitious and emotionally charged finale."
"The tone of The Dark Knight Rises is set from the very first scene, when we are introduced to Bane (Tom Hardy) who crashes a plane that he himself is a passenger to. This is the first time we see the brute strength that he possesses. He is insanely strong through the use of the chemical ""venom"" which is pumped into him through his mask. As we leap into the rest of the story we see right away that director, Christopher Nolan, wasted no time in picking up right where he left off in The Dark Knight, with the death of Harvey Dent, and Batman being the criminal. This film was one of the big blockbusters in summer 2012, and for good reason. This movie brings the classic Batman comic book characters to life, which is evident in the acting, the sets, the script, the plot, and as many know, the dramatic ending. The acting is so well done, as we see emotion poured into each roll. Christian Bale (Bruce Wayne) Michael Cane (Alfred Pennyworth), Tom Hardy (Bane), and Anne Hathaway (Selena Kyle) all dove head first into their roles, leaving nothing behind. They each play a convincing role, identical to the characters that are portrayed in the Batman comics. One of the best examples is the relationship between Batman and Catwoman, because Batman is just, and Catwoman is a thief, but they are romantically involved with each other. The sets of this movie are stunning. Bruce Wayne's mansion and Batcave are just as they are depicted in the original comics. They are all encompassing and eye candy to any Batman lover. As we look back to the 1990's, we see a Batman comic book story arc that is very similar to the plot of TDKR. But Nolan's twist on the storyline is a refreshing change. Some may disagree, but not knowing what is coming next is part of the joy that comes with this film. Nolan keeps some of the key reference points in his film, but adds his own interesting, and modern additions to the film. Take for example, Bane's appearance. In the comics, Bane was unrealistically strong, and in the film he is much more realistically depicted. The only complaint I have with this film is, if Bane is so strong, why does he cover up his muscles with a vest or a coat for the majority of the movie? Show off your strength, be proud! The plot is the main focus point, like it should be. If explosions and fighting is all you want to see, then go see Pacific Rim. I'll say sorry in advance if you have wasted your time with that movie. Getting back on track to the plot, which might take a couple of watch throughs to fully catch all of the detail in this storyline. Throughout this movie, the focus is not on Batman, as one would expect, but on Gotham City itself. Bane brings the city to hell and back, and Batman is sitting on the side lines, bruised and battered, left watching, waiting, and hoping that his beloved city isn't left shattered and destroyed. The script of TDKR was written with pure precision, which allows us, as an audience, to remember key points of the movie through the use of dramatic quotes. Bane has a lot of one-liners that leave you repeating them to your friends after you see the film. Here are a few examples of memorable Bane quotes; ""But you merely adopted the dark; I was born in it, molded by it."" ""when it is done and Gotham is ashes, then you have my permission to die."" Because of Bane's voice, these short, memorable lines only add to the effect Nolan was going for. Leaving you on the edge of your seat wondering how Batman could possibly win? The moment you doubt if the good guy can win, that's when you know the director has succeeded.

This was a very well done film, and I encourage you to see it several times (it might take a few times to fully grasp the story) and the way this film ends is the perfect way to close out the series. In the end it all comes down to autopilot, back stabbing, and a turn of events by a woman you would not expect, all ending in an unpredictable manner."
The Dark Knight Rises is one of the most intense super hero movies I have watched. The opening scene is intense as the bad guys swing into action to get the good guys as the plane is moving into a tail spin. This time the world is void of the Bat crusader as he is in mourning the loss of his beloved. The plot lines are mix as you feel at times you need a chart to know who the good and bad guy is. The thread though out the movie is dark and deep and the most dramatic character is the bad guy Bane appears to take over the city of Gotham. A long movie that will keep you in total suspense until the end of the run. This movies does a good job of bringing into the mix several story lines from the comic book series. bravo!
"as much as i am huge fan of the batman in almost every facet of the genre, i am having a hard time getting completely behind this film. it makes the same mistake a lot of sequels do: it tries to pack too much into the story. the reason why the first two films in the trilogy, batman begins and the dark knight, worked so well was because they mostly focused on one central story and villain. in the dark knight rises there are too many new characters and too many story lines to be introduced and told that the film loses focus. sure it has plenty of action which you would expect but nolan strays too far from the source material when it comes to the characters in the film. the cast does a fine job with the script they had to work with and most film goers will probably like this film but i think true fans of the batman who know the history of the characters will wonder what nolan is doing to their batman."
"What is up with all this haters? Seriously, it makes me want to laugh because they're so ignorant. Some people here are saying: ""Worst Batman film ever"", or: ""I prefer watching Adam West Batman than this mess."" Wow, just wow. Anyways, enough complaining, this is one of the greatest conclusions in film trilogies history. No worry, this is a spoiler free review. The film is almost 3 hours long and the impressive thing is, the movie is NEVER dull, it's always keeping you interested because if its smart dialog and action. The story is great too. Bruce Wayne has stopped fighting crime as the Batman for 8 years after the Joker wanted to terrorize Gotham. But now a new threat has arrived, Bane. His plan is to burn Gotham to ashes and the Batman is the only one who can stop him.

Now the cast in this movie is really good. Christian Bale is a great Batman as always. Michael Caine deserves an Oscar nomination as best Supporting character for his amazing performance as Alfred Pennyworth. Anne Hathaway really impressed me as Catwoman. She steals any scene she's in. Tom Hardy as Bane is a great villain in this film. My favorite villain since the Joker. Joseph Gordon Levitt as John Blake delivers a good performance as well. Also Morgan Freeman and Marion Cottillard were good as well.

I love Trilogies, this trilogy is in my top 5 and ranks #2 right behind The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. In conclusion this is an amazing trilogy, the best of superheroes films and the second best trilogy of all time. All I have to say is, thank you Mr. Nolan, thank you. 10/10."
"This film is spectacular, the closest thing I have seen to perfection in film since the good ol days of filmmaking.

If you're hoping its better than The Dark Knight, your hopes have been answered. Christopher Nolan somehow outdoes himself once again, delivering a fantastic plot with great action, character development, and direction.

The writing itself is a wonder. The dialogue in this film is outstanding and perfectly fits each character.

Heath Ledger set a new standard for acting talent in comic book films. TDKR definitely meets that bar, possibly surpassing it. No single performance is better than Ledger's but everyone gives 110% in this and it comes together nicely. Christian Bale gives perhaps his most heartfelt performance in this one, and Tom Hardy is terrifying as Bane. Other regulars such as Caine and Oldman are just as good as ever. Joseph Gordon Levitt is a breath of fresh air and plays his part to perfection. However, I give it to Anne Hathaway for stealing the show. She is seductive, sexy, and dangerous as Catwoman, and becomes the very essence of the femme fatale.

Hans Zimmer continues to be my favorite film composer. His score simply blows me away, especially the way he uses the chants from the trailers as Bane's theme. Zimmer promised us an epic score, and delivered.

Editor Lee Smith and Director of Photography Wally Pfister both continue their win streak, as well as production designer Nathan Crowley and Costume designer Lindy Hemming.

All in all, TDKR is the best of this series. It is emotionally gripping and, at times, gutwrenching. As a current film student, I can honestly say that TDKR possesses all of the essential qualities of an Oscar for Best Picture. If you have seen the previous two Batman movies, you will enjoy this film so much more than you ever have. It truly is a whole new cinematic experience."
"So after seeing the The Dark Knight my expectations were pretty high for this movie and most movies would fail miserably but luckily The Dark Knight Rises is not one of most movies. It absolutely lived up to my expectations. What was good about the movie? Pretty much everything. The acting was top notch in this movie everyone does a good job in it. The action was great but the movie is great without action. Tom Hardy as Bane is one of the most terrifying villains I have ever seen. I likes the characters, the story everything. The one gripe that people might have is that it is very dark. But even that is not a real issue. In the end I loved this movie I recommend it to everyone an even though its not as good as The Dark Knight its still an amazing movie."
"Right from the start of the movie you will be on the edge of your seat. Personally I think this is the best conclusion I have ever seen. Performance of each actor in the movie is outstanding.Before I saw the movie I thought that Anne Hathaway wouldn't be as good cat-woman as Michelle Pfeiffer was, but not only was she better, she blew Michelle away. All the special effects are amazing and unbelievable. I have to say I love some of the batman's new toys. I have seen it in V Max theater last night but I am going to see it again in I MAX because Its worth the experience. It runs for 2 hours and 45 minutes but it felt like 30 minutes and I wanted more. 10 stars is not enough for such a great movie. I recommend to all movie lovers out there to go and see it in cinemas."
"what can i say really, this movie is fantastic. the plot is genius. the actors and so well put together. the best movie of 2012!

The direction they took this movie is beautiful. and the way ended the trilogy is breathtaking.

This is the best batman movie. his biggest job yet!

Save gotham one last time! the rise sequence is perfect. Lovie it!

10/10 all the way.

nolan the way.....

Nolan is amazing! :)

Also, Bane is great. Now i like joker and bane both. i like them eqaul. The joker scared me but yet i rooted for him. Bane really freaked me out! Scary stuff!"
"The Dark Knight Rises and Falls. I cannot put it in more simpler words than that.

I went in there with my coffers full of hope of having my mind blown out. After all it was Christopher Nolan and I am yet to see a work of his which has under-delivered.

But I guess everything has a first time.

Don't get me wrong. It's a good movie, not just a great one, and it left me highly confused as to how I should feel about it. TDKR, more than anything, falls under its own weight. With the endless hype and as a follow up to one of the greatest superhero movies of all time, TDKR had a lot riding on its shoulders. Tasked with this,Christopher Nolan has to be lauded for what he has achieved, or should I rather say 'hoped to'?

Let's begin with the basics. The Dark Knight trilogy was not a trilogy to begin with. Batman Begins (BB) and The Dark Knight (TDK) are almost two independent Batman films with little in common in terms of a story arc other than the characters it carries forward. That given, TDKR's greatest flaw was in attempting to connect the first movie to his final one so as to make it feel like one continuous arc. (Think kind of what happened in the final season of LOST) While I understand Nolan's intentions, the forced continuity just killed it.

This was further amplified by the many plot holes that marred the story. To keep this review spoiler free I will not mention any of them here but it will suffice to say that if you are a fan of the series but are willing to look past your fanboy goggles, the failings are plain to see.

Tom Hardy's take on the superstrong Bane was interesting enough to start off with, but as it went on there were just too many similarities with a previous villain (I will not say which one) to actually stand out on his own. Even his motives and methods were too familiar to be regarded as novel. His fights with Batman were epic enough though, and you almost pity Batman for having to face the mini-hulk that Hardy had transformed himself into. His menacing voice coupled with the cold hard stare in his eyes gave him the aura of a truly awful foe, one that must not be triffled with.

But add to that some cringe worthy dialogues, forgetful action sequences and appalling acting by Marion Cotillard, and I find myself subtracting more from the movie than adding. Nolan needed to make this movie bigger and better than the previous two, and for that he needed a crisis large enough to destroy Batman's world. While he did manage to conjur up a scheme, its immensity and implausibility made it hard to believe. I really wanted to love this movie but far too often found myself shaking my head in dismay as things got grander and larger, until they no more fit into the world.

But while I might seem to be cursing the movie a lot, remember I did say it is a good movie. And the best thing for me in the movie was - wait for it - Anne Hathaway as Catwoman/Selina Kyle.

I will confess that when I had first heard the casting I was more than dismayed. But now I'm forced to eat my own words. Anne Hathaway was brilliant. She might not be your regular comic book version of Selina Kyle, but in Nolan's Dark Knight universe she was the perfect choice to portray Gotham's sexiest vigilante. Everything from her stance to her fight moves and to the way she spouted sassy dialogues was perfect. Given more time and space, I am sure she could have probably stolen the show.

That however would have been unfair to Christian Bale/Bruce Wayne/Batman. The man has been a constant shining light throughout the series. He is a perfect fit for the role and has carried both versions of his character almost flawlessly. Moving into his third (and final) film in the series, I am glad to say he has not faltered a bit. While BB was about Batman, and TDK about the Joker, this movie was about Bruce Wayne the man behind the mask. As a superhero who is a mere mortal compared to most others out there, TDKR's focus on Bruce Wayne's mortality was totally warranted. This was not a Batman movie. This was a Bruce Wayne movie, with his alter ego guest starring. TDKR plays out like the swansong it is to this great character Bale and Nolan have moulded over the years.

Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine are as dependable as usual. They provided stellar performances as always. Even the newcomer to series - Joseph Gordon-Levitt gave a fine performance as the hotheaded cop John Blake. His character was by far one of the most interesting in the movie, developing into interesting dimensions, but alas finally being let down partly by the story and mostly by the limited run time that a movie of this scope can afford to a new character.

All in all, TDKR is a fine movie, but sadly nothing more. While I thoroughly enjoyed the ending (the last 5-10 minutes) and a bunch of scenes here and there, the action sequenced seemed bland, and the motives for some of the main characters left a lot to be desired. Batman was great as usual, but Bruce Wayne was better. And given the track-record of threequels, TDKR is a comparatively great ending to a great series, even if it is not all that it could have been. Probably the weakest entry to the series but nonetheless a wholesome entertainer on its own merits. Just don't expect to be blown away."
"I am not a critic but an average movie goer , but I must say that this movie is a pale shadow of the previous movie .

Missing the usual quality of a Chris Nolan movie . The movie lacks the frenetic pace of the previous title .First half of the movie is painfully slow . Second half picks up pace but still no big fireworks. Anne Hathaway unexpectedly performed very well in her role .

Weak story line .Background score average .Villain is simply lame with a dog mask ,and is nowhere near the calibre of Joker.No great twists or surprise in the plot ,lacks suspense .

Overall a better than average movie .Take my advice watch it at home ."
"The Dark Knight Rises is a brilliant,excellent and masterful epic conclusion to The Dark Knight Trilogy. Filled with excellent direction,wonderful performances,great Action and epic storytelling,The Dark Knight Rises is Christopher Nolan at his best.

Set eight years after the events in The Dark Knight,Batman/Bruce Wayne(Christian Bale) has been a recluse and retired as Batman and Gotham City has been at peace as well as safe and quiet. But when a new threat and terrorist named Bane(Tom Hardy)comes into Gotham City and threatens to destroy and demolish Gotham,Batman must come out of retirement to fight and face Bane and save the city of Gotham from destruction.

The Dark Knight Rises is a powerful and unforgettable conclusion to The Dark Knight Trilogy,it is a film that loved since I saw it in theaters and I cannot understand why the film has gotten a mixed to negative reception with most Batman fans. I guess because this film came out after Nolan's other films The Dark Knight and Inception which raised the bar really high when it comes to filmmaking and were universally loved by everyone and comparing this film with the other two this film can be seen as letdown for most people but not to me. The Dark Knight Rises is an Epic in the truest since of the word because Nolan has created a film that is big not only in length(2 Hours and 45 minutes)but in scope as well bringing everything to higher level whether it's the Action or the storyline. The film was so epic it probably would be longer with an overture like the epics of the 50s and 60s. Most of the time the third film in the trilogy is usually seen as the weakest but Nolan is a smart filmmaker who knows that if you are going to complete a trilogy you have to go out with a huge bang and TDKR goes out with not only a bang but with explosions. What I love about TDK Trilogy is that while all of them are three connected films all them are different in story. If Batman Begins is an origin story and Action/Adventure and The Dark Knight is a Crime Drama then TDKR can be described as a War Film. TDKR is War Film in sense where there are armies rising and gangs are controlling the streets with power,guns and tanks and Gotham is divided like a Civil War between the rich and poor or cops and criminals. With the theme of War and control running throughout the film you pulled into a Dystopian nightmare where Gotham City is being held hostage and not the cops or government can do anything about it and the only person that can do anything about is Batman. In TDKR we see not only the physical but also the mental toll being Batman has had on Bruce Wayne. Bruce has become broken down and a recluse and the damage of being Batman has affected his friendships and relationships or lack there of. Bane is such a great villain because where The Joker in TDK wanted to make people evil and corrupt and wanted to burn Gotham,Bane wants the people of Gotham to take control and take back the city of Gotham from the corrupt and the rich and create a revolution and army and still wants to destroy Gotham City. Bane is villain unlike Batman has ever faced before because Bane can match Batman on no only a physical level but on an intelligence level as well. The Action scenes in the film are amazing and like the first two films are done in a realistic way. Each Action scene is handled with a great deal of suspense and build up and this time it is done on an big scale to match the epic feel of the film. When the Action in the film happens you are glued to the screen and mesmerized. The ending of the film lasts about 20-30 minutes and it will blow you away with it's filmmaking and craft. The ending will have you cheering and smiling and it is a great conclusion to this film and The Dark Knight Trilogy.

The cast does an excellent jobs in their roles. Christian Bale is excellent in his final performance as Batman/Bruce Wayne bringing the same depth and intensity to the role. Tom Hardy is simply brilliant and scary as Bane,with using his voice,eyes and body language for the performance. Hardy's performance in my opinion makes Bane one of the best villains in film history. Gary Oldman is great once again as Jim Gordan,with Oldman bringing cynicism and depth to the role. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is fantastic as Blake,an idealistic rookie cop. Anne Hathaway is wonderful and sexy as Catwoman/Selina Kyle and has great scenes with Bale. Marion Cotillard does a great job as Miranda,Bruce's other love interest. Morgan Freeman excels once again as Lucius Fox,Batman's weapon maker. Michael Caine is amazing once again as Alfred. Caine's final scenes with Bale are powerful and well-acted. Matthew Modine(Foley)and Ben Mendelsohn(Daggett)give good performances as well.

The direction by Christopher Nolan is excellent and brilliant,with Nolan always moving the camera and having great shots and camera angles and giving the film an epic feel and Nolan does a great job with the Action scenes. Great direction by Nolan.

The score by Hans Zimmer is brilliant and intense and matches the dark and epic tone of the film. A great memorable score by Zimmer.

In final word,if you love Batman,Christopher Nolan,Comic Book films,Superhero films or films in general,I highly suggest you see The Dark Knight Rises,a brilliant,masterful and epic conclusion to an excellent trilogy that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10."
"well may lot of you not going to like my review cause am really really a great big fan of batman.after batman begins,and fabulous the dark knight,am just waiting when the 3rd installment of nolan series going to released.well a lot of time has passed but i am writing this review because i just thought i should have right something for it cause i love this movie.its almost 2 years now and trust me friends,,every night i watch one of the batman movie.specially dark knight rises,i have watched it more than 200 times.so i think you can imagine i am quite disbalanced from my head site.whatever people say it don't really matter.the only thing is matter how much did u enjoyed when you seen a movie.christopher nolans batman series is one of the best movies i have seen in my life.many many thanks to you sir.Christian bale,,you are just amazing.the joker, ben each and every character are truly remarkable.i just love the full batman team.the dark knight is the best in the series.but the dark knight rises may don't have the strong content like the previous installment but its really a huge entertainment for me.hope batman will come again to save the gotham..."
"Title: The title is perfect for movie story specially for main character. Actually it's better than 'batman' to me.

Genre: Action: In my point of view, action seemed to be a wrestling show.

Crime: Yes, this is an actual crime movie.

Thrill: It's truly thrilling at each and every sequence of movie.

Drama: The total dramatic plot is tremendously evolved with strong characters

Visual Effects: The batman's ride thing, bike, burning property etc are extremely accurate.

Character: Obviously Christian Bale and Tom Hardy.

Overall, I like it. It is really enjoyable and entertaining. Of course you'd want to see it again and again."
"I don't know where to start,. The power source shown in movie caught my eye;its very nice of Nolan to show the very future power source without loss of reality.

The action scenes between Wayne and Bane are so dramatic that when Batman hits Bane it clearly portrays that it was more out of confidence and will to fight against evil rather than strength and muscle whereas it appears opposite in case of Bane hitting Batman.The Catwoman's action scenes couldn't have been better the attitude,spontaneous performance,flexibility in physique are perfectly played by Anne Hathaway.

Hans Zimmer's music is an extra ordinary asset to the film .the back scroll in every action sequence is so wonderful to bring up goose bumps all-over.Especially the chant 'deh-shay bas-ha bas-ha' is clouded with drum beat and would take you into the depths of morality in the movie.

After a movie like 'The Dark Knight' its the very guts of Nolan to continue that should be appreciated.he must be a very good social visionary to write-up such an excellent ending to the trilogy.I don't need to separately chant praises on his direction and screenplay.And the twists in movie surprises everyone."
"With a gargantuan ambition, huge stakes, powerful themes, compelling characters and a fantastic third act, The Dark Knight Rises exceeded my already sky high expectations, and delivered an extremely satisfying conclusion to the trilogy."
"Words cannot adequately describe how awesome this movie is! It is everything you thought it would be and much more. Most certainly a beautifully crafted psychological crime thriller and a truly satisfying conclusion that does justice to the trilogy. Batman isn't exactly the cool hero with fancy gadgets nor is he the strongest. His inner strength is tested, he is physically and mentally pushed to his limits and all odds are against him. What an epic finale!

Christian Bale as always is perfect as Bruce Wayne and Batman but Tom Hardy's portrayal of Bane almost steals the show. Unlike Batman's mask where you get to see the emotions through eyes and mouth of the actor, Bane's mask covers his entire mouth, leaving only his eyes in view. Despite an obscured face, actor Tom Hardy seems to have found a way to brilliantly express his emotions physically! He projects Bane's character, the strength, pain, attitude and the darkness by movements and body language alone! Bane is as intellectual as he is strong, which makes him genuinely terrifying. He is easily the most formidable of all Batman villains in the trilogy and simply owned the scenes he was in.

Hans Zimmer does an excellent job with the background score that sets the pace of the movie and compliments the visual artistry. The music makes you feel the excitement and energy of the movie. Both Anne Hathaway and Joseph Gordon-Levitt do justice to their characters. Hathaway is believable as Catwoman. Last but not the least, Michael Caine gives a very effective and heartfelt performance as Alfred.

The special effects in this movie are so good, that it seems very real. The Batpod, which made its appearance in Dark Knight is back in this movie and it is exceedingly cool. But wait till you see 'The Bat'!

This movie has a stellar start, will keep you on the edge of your seat with adrenaline-pumping action sequences, intense drama both emotional and dark, has several layers of the story interweaving with frequent curve balls thrown in. But the movie never loses momentum, it ultimately sets you up for a fantastic climax and probably a very unpredictable yet satisfying end. It will keep you guessing till the very last second and that is the magic of Christopher Nolan's amazing masterpiece, The Dark Knight Rises.

I will give this movie 10 out of 10."
"Every time a good superhero movie is made ,fanatic fanboys have to rush to IMDb to declare it as the ""Greatest Movie Ever Made"" LOL,, I do give them credit for a least being consistent. With that said, it was a good movie but should not even be in any top 100. Yes, the storyline was far fetched for real life but hey, it's the norm for a sci-fi thriller action movie. Villain wants to destroy stuff,, hero must stop him. It was well acted, and the action, while not ground breaking was shot very well. While Anne Hathaway is great to look at, and done an okay job , I felt you could of totally removed her character from the entire film and it would not have made any difference . It was almost like her role was just filler material. In the end to me it's just a fun summer movie to get lost in,,but not to put on a pedestal..."
"The Dark Knight rises is easily the most anticipated film of the year and has a lot to live up to with the previous two entries just seeming to get better and better. With the same creative team intact, can Nolan and Bale pull off the ultimate finale to their trilogy and deliver the film we've all been waiting for or will it fall to the dreaded bad third film syndrome that seems to plague most series?

The Dark Knight Rises continues the journey of Batman eight years after he took the fall for the death and crimes of Harvey Dent. Forced back into action to take on the terrorist Bane, the Dark Knight returns to protect the city that looks at him as an enemy. The Dark Knight was a brilliant film on numerous levels so going in this film already had a big hurdle to overcome. While it may not have completely overshadowed the previous entry, it easily finds its place on equal ground. This final entry to the Nolan series continues to bring these three films together becoming essentially one long film. Rises brings new realm of personal journey to numerous characters old and new. Christian Bale steps back into the role like he never left bringing a new pain that seems to elevate both Wayne and Batman to another level. Most fans will be happy to know that while the growl like voice is still here, it is toned down a bit so not to be quite as off putting. Michael Caine is given a bit more to do taking the character study between Alfred and Wayne that has been building and he delivers more of his motivational and emotional speeches like only he can. Gary Oldman gets a bit more to do as well getting to channel the Gordon we have been waiting for since the beginning. Tom Hardy steps into the role of Bane, a character that is met with mixed emotions. Known in the comics as the villain that broke the bat, has had many incarnations, most of them not all that good and not widely known to those that aren't comic fans. Believe it or not, Nolan has taken a fairly single dimension character and brought to life a destructive force that smashes through this film with no remorse. The big surprise was Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle aka Catwoman. She seemed to be channeling some of the previous versions, most notably that of the 60's series minus the camp. She really makes this character work bringing the sexiness as well as a more empowered woman aspect to the character. She is easily the best incarnation of this character so far.

The story is well crafted bringing all the characters together along with the story to create an epic piece of filmmaking. There are numerous levels to the story that worked well for every character giving each of them their own small story without ever making the film feel overcrowded or forced. It takes a bit to get going, but not in a bad way. There are some pretty heavy moments that push this film along, but will keep you away from the action for longer than you may want. Much like the source material this trilogy is a character study of the inner struggles of a man and not so much about the action. Make no mistake there are plenty of action sequences, each bigger than the next. Nolan has slowed the action down a bit, namely during the fight scenes letting the viewer finally get a better glimpse of the Dark Knight in action. Kudos to Nolan as gone are most of the fancy well-choreographed fights and in their place is a brutality that is needed to make the Bane story work.

This is not only a great film, but a brilliant cap to an already brilliant series. It's a truly amazing experience to see this film come to life and wrap up a series that has continued to get better and better. There are plenty of moments that will make both comic and non-comic fans alike smile and cheer. Nolan has stamped his mark on the Batman universe and has done something almost never thought possible. He has delivered a brilliant Batman trilogy and managed to keep the entire brilliant cast in tact all the way down to members of the Wayne Corp board members. This is a film that will make you cheer and sad that it is coming to an end. As this series comes to an end and the credits role you will find yourself sighing in relief and happiness knowing Nolan pulled it off and wondering what's next for the Batman."
"Ultimately, this is an excellent film, but after seeing this as part of an all night trilogy viewing, I have to say it is not as good as The Dark Knight.

The film opens with, strangely for Nolan a quite farcical scene that introduces Bane. I won't spoil it, but please tell me, who takes 3 unknown prisoners on a plane without even looking at their faces? Really??

The proper story starts, and to chose words like jaded, withdrawn, cynical, tired, lethargic and disconnected, is how we find our hero and Police commissioner. So ultimately this is how the audience is manipulated into feeling too, and so act 1 is ultimately a long ""downer"" as lots of elements are put in place for the last 2 acts. But, after sitting through six hours of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, I was left feeling it was too much, and I started getting bored with the overall emotional shade of the film, coupled with the lack of action and the lack of any real story. It was like watching a plate spinner getting 40 plates spinning on pointy poles, necessary for his act, but ultimately boring for his audience.

The second Act is where our bad guy makes his play and gains the upper hand. One of the strongest sources of praise for The Dark Knight, is the ultimately real-world story telling. But what Bane unleashes on Gotham, takes us back to the more comic book villainy of the first film, which I won't criticise, but for me is not as rewarding as the realism of the second film. All the while our good guys are slow, wrong footed, and creaking under their mental baggage, so we are two thirds through a superhero film, where our superhero has been anything but. Action has been thin on the ground, and we have all been through the ringer, and we are crying for some redeeming pay-off.

After the third act, our her is restored, all has been put right. However, ultimately our pay-off for all we have been put through in the first two acts is only satisfying if you can shrug off the memory of what you have just been put through. It's much like childbirth, you need your brain to be swimming with endorphins to blank out the pain of labour, and for me, I didn't get enough endorphins to make the experience totally rewarding.

Add to this, a slightly facial bad-guy twist, and a groan-worthy sequel shoe-in, I have to say that Nolan has tried to squeeze in far too much, and Batman's saga creeps over the line, rather than ending with a bang, so much so, you will feel convinced that this is not the final part of the story, and we will need another installment to accept that our hero has sailed off into the sunset."
"Apologies, Dominus, I have done many reviews here but to get this one right took me 5 years and multiple re-watchings.

Conclusion? Not merely great, but the ""great-est"" superhero film of all time. The story is iconic and majestic in scope. The script not merely good, it borders on perfection. The performances are nothing less than stunning.

Bale and Oldman could not give a bad performance even if you asked them. Hathaway has never looked this good, her height and frame infusing her Catwoman with a vibe never seen before or since. And the almost-invisible Tom Hardy (one of the greatest actors of our age, BTW) makes Bane as interesting a character, if not moreso, than even Darth Vader himself.

So why did this review take me 5 years? To discover the dissonance between the three parts of the trilogy, which is the only flaw, the Achilles Heel of the boxed set.

Ordinarily a trilogy should be harmonious and consistent. Look at the original Lord of the Rings as the best example. Each part not only stands on its own but, taken in sequence, the story builds, the characters become clearer, everything works to a conclusion.

Like an orchestra reaching a crescendo.

Not so here. The whole is weakened by the sum of the parts. Batman Begins is, frankly, sloppy. Great ideas and even great performances are lost in a weak narrative with a unsatisfying conclusion.

The Dark Knight has become iconic in its own right but not because of the way it continues the story, but rather because of the amazing one-of-a-kind performance by Ledger.

It is only when we get to Part 3 that we achieve perfection. This film is not merely better than than the first two, it may be the best film of its genre, ever."
"It's been eight years since the events of the immediate predecessor to this(a film that this matches in most ways, tops in several, and the only thing it lacks that that has, is Heath Ledger's Joker, and, well, that's part force majeure), and we see the outcome of that. Legislation has made organized crime a thing of the past in the city, and with no need for the caped crusader, Bruce(once again impeccably acted by Bale... and yes, the voice has thankfully been toned down) has a gap in his life that he doesn't know how to fill(straining the relationship between him and Alfred, played by the usually charming and compelling Caine). When a mysterious masked man, known as Bane, a dominating physical presence with a brain(played largely by Hardy's eyes and brows... taking a ton of his tools as an actor away, and still he does incredible), with unclear motives makes his presence known, he realizes he will have to become Batman again. But is he enough to take out this new threat? This finishes the series, providing closure to the characters and story. Catwoman is done right here, and just about perfect. She's finally a femme fatale... hot and manipulative. They do with her what we hoped they'd do with Black Widow. And this does justice to the relationship between her and Wayne. The performances are great all around. Most return from the other two(and Freeman gets a lot more to do), with a few new faces, such as Gordon-Levitt as idealistic cop John. This does a lot to surprise us, and like TDk, it does it right, with hardly any of them being unnecessary, and none of them insulting. The bleakness is back and amplified - this puts its titular hero and its audience through a serious amount of pain and conflict, with a genuine feeling that it might not work out. And as a result of this, and other brave decisions made(you can barely believe these are mainstream movies!), it becomes really powerful, really draws us in. The action is the biggest and best of these(the jet he uses is awesome! And the Pod gets some more really cool use, in the edge-of-your-seat chases, and we get fast martial arts(and covered well!), and the stakes and tension are the highest(and frankly, if they were raised any higher, it would be excessive... this is already as draining as the last one). There is a lot of disturbing content, some violence and a little moderate to strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone interested in these(and make sure you've watched the other two first, this really adds to them). 10/10"
"Got to watch it in a preview show here in India. Was stunned with the way Nolan has narrated the story. It is simply AWESOME! Everything looks so perfect here, right from the starting, till the end credits roll. Even though i am not an ardent fan of action/superhero movies, I liked the first two installments of the series, so the expectation for this was so huge. And to be frank, i am happy with the outcome. Ii is brilliant in every aspect. Nolan's direction is top-notch and he is the real hero of the movie. I even felt goosebumps in certain sequences. I do not want to reveal the story much, but what i can say is, this one is a must for every movie lover. Such an awesome performance from Tom Hardy! I was just amazed to see him perform Bane. Christian Bale is no less, he is literally perfect reprising his role from the previous two films. The other actors have done good job. But i missed Heath Ledger, may his soul rest in peace. Anyway, what i have to say is, do not miss this film, lest it is a real loss for you. I would like to rate it 8.5/10, And Hats off to Nolan and the entire crew for giving us such a cinematic experience."
"Another achievement by Nolan Bros. and Warner Bros... Thanks to its huge budget available (ca 230 million USD) one could use state-of-the-art technology and employ a dream-team of actors of different generations: Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Anne Hathaway, Joseph Gordon-Levitt... And they got the opportunity to have elaborated roles to play, not just appearing in the background; Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth is probably the finest of the great ones. Moreover, it is no comic strip movie, but an epic story of universal values, attitudes and issues, with superhero and sci-fi moments complementing the script, not governing it.

Minuses from me due to length (ca 2,5 hours) and too obvious references/comparisons with characters from other hit movies (e.g. Hannibal, Catwoman, James Bond). But still, the movie is worth watching and recommendable!"
"This movie is full of excitement, explosions, and edge of your seat moments. It ties up all of the loose ends in a great culmination to the series. The casting is perfect. I was surprised by some of the characters that were added. I would have liked to see the story line continued though. It is a bit of a let down that they didn't incorporate more of the villains.Or even continue the series to include cooperative adventures for multiple DC heroes.It is great that they managed to keep all of the same actors from the previous movies. It irritated me when they changed the actress who played Rachel. I think that this is a good date movie or movie for a family with older children. Of course it is great for a guys night. Make sure you have you popcorn ready."
"As the ending chapter in the trilogy I enjoyed this movie the most. It had more of Bruce Wayne than just Batman. It showed Bruce's face behind the Batman mask and did so believably. Like we all know the Joker took the spotlight in the previous film and the first one was more Batman action. So we got a trilogy with a balanced focus between the guise, the seamlessly corrupt and the person behind the guise. Which is nice.

As a movie about the struggling person behind the mask this was, for me, the most touching out of the three films. And the most hope inducing, seeing Bruce Wayne recollect himself from the pit and rise to stand on his own feet. Re-mustering his courage and will."
"The Dark Knight Rises (2012)

*** 1/2 (out of 4)

The final film in Christopher Nolan's trilogy finds Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) coming out of retirement and putting on the Batman suit as he tries to save Gotham City from a nuclear weapon being controlled by Bane (Tom Hardy). THE DARK KNIGHT RISES isn't quite as good as the previous film but I'd put it a little ahead of the first movie in the series but no matter how you rank them you really have to give Nolan, Bale and company credit for really delivering a very special series that I'm sure went a lot higher than most people thought when news broke that this group would be taking over the franchise. While this film is far from perfect there are still so many great things that it's easy to get lost in the film and caught up in the various situations going on. I think the strongest thing going for the picture is the wonderful visual style and as with the previous two films, the way Nolan builds this dark atmosphere and city is just something so many other directors should be studying going forward. Another major asset is that Bale can bring that dark and mysterious nature to the Wayne character while at the same time being very believable in the part of Batman. I think it's fair to say that he's put his stamp on the character and if this is his last go at it then he's done more than any previous actor. The supporting cast includes strong work from Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Mario Cotillard and Gary Oldman. Hardy was extremely good in the villain role of Bane and really helped make the film so much fun. Anne Hathaway gives a decent performance as Catwoman but I must admit that I thought the screenplay really didn't do much for the character and in the end she had little impact with me. The 164-minute running time does seem a bit too drawn out at spots but I was still rather amazed at how well it flowed and this credit certainly goes to Nolan. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES closes this trilogy and really ends it with a bang and it's clear that the series going forward will have a lot to live up to."
The writing is horrible and the pace is agonizingly draining.
"To be honest....there's not much to say about this movie. I am an avid film critic and I am completely lost for words.

Christopher Nolan is the best director/writer/producer/creator right now and now arguably of all time. Christian Bale = consistently phenomenal. Tom Hardy = unbelievable. Hewitt = great young actor. Hathaway = incredible. Freeman = Freeman, enough said.

The Dark Knight Rises has not only set the bar for superhero/action movies, but movies of all genres. 15/10..yup. Unbelievable.

There really isn't much to say about this movie because honestly there is nothing to compare it too. NO movie comes close...try to argue it and I will leave you in the dust. Enough said...I'm done. WOW"
"Before I get down-voted because I'm not giving 'The Dark Knight Rises' a 10 (the trend most of the users on her seem to be following), I'll list the numbers of things I really enjoyed about the film, and there were plenty.

-The cast Nolan's able to put together to end his trilogy is really something to marvel at. From the veterans of the series (Bale, Freeman, Caine, Oldman) to the new faces (Gordon-Levitt, Cotillard, Hathway, Hardy) each bring their all to their characters, even if a few are somewhat undeveloped (more on that later).

-Action scenes. 'Batman Begins,' while I admire it for it's first look at the gritty take to the comic formula, had some incredible poor and incomprehensible fight scenes, where it was unclear how who punching what or what was happening. In 'The Dark Knight,' the scenes were much more clear, a big improvement. Here, the fighting scenes are at their best. When Baine and Batman throw down, it's some of the most intense fight scenes I've seen in a long time.

-Huge setpieces. I could say that about all of these movies, but in this film especially. Gotham City is beautifully recognized. It's always great to see a huge place like this down naturally, never been plagued by artificial CGI (Nolan uses as little as possible.) Not to mention the number of extras, which number in the thousands.

-The ending. Even if it jumps the shark, the ending to Nolan's epic trilogy is overall fulfilling. Fans of the series won't be disappointed, even if the casual might

Not that that's out of the way, the problems I had with the film. . .

-Bane's voice. When we first meet Bane, on a plane, his voice was nearly unbearable. It sounded like something a ten-year-old would do when playing with audio effects on his computer. The dialogue didn't help, as he spewed out clunky one-liners. Here was Bane, with his terrifying appearance,sounding like a cartoon. It did improve over the ocurse of the movie, but the first introduction to the character was something I almost couldn't shake off.

-Too many character introductions. Maybe this is a criticism of the whole trilogy, but I'll have to put the blame on this one. Too many characters are brought in, with their developments feeling rushed. It almost appears like Nolan adds these new additions to the script at the last minute.

For the most part, the good outweighs the bad. It's a very entertaining film and, as far as summer blockbusters, it's definitely worth the price of admission.

7/10"
"I have seen all of the batman movies (all of them) and saying the The Dark Knight Rises is the best out of any of them is no understatement. Nolan delivers a spectacular conclusion to the best trilogy I've ever witnessed in the cinemas. Every camera shot, order of scenes, and the dialogue was so meticulously delivered, it sets the bar pretty damn close to perfection.

Lets start off with the actors, Christian Bale reprised the role of Batman brilliantly. Failure, redemption, and all the emotions that took part in his character, Bale delivered and did to convincingly. Anne Hathaway, although she had big shoes to fill (pheiffer) did not disappoint. I could see why a younger fresher actress beaten out the likes of Angeline Jolie and Charlize Theron for the role. The Selina Kyle in Nolan's interpretation was cunning, intelligent, beautiful, deadly and yet humane. The veterans (john michael cane, morgan freeman) were fantastic as expected. The real surprise for me was Tom Hardy. The manifestation of Bane. The first thing that came to my mind while I was walking out of the theater was how much fear the character had conveyed. Not only in his own actions but how people reacted to his character. I am sort of tired so I will stop here. I must say though, to all who love bashing movies, save it for another. This movie is one to see. Don't wait for it come out on bluray or download it, go to the theater and watch it. It is not a movie, but an experience."
"I was super excited since the very day when the trailer of the movie came out and was waiting ever eagerly for another master piece by one of the greatest movie makers of all time Christopher Nolan. I was fortunate enough to see it first day. And yes it was not all disappointing as the movie was truly amazing.

The story line woven intricately with all the characters touches you heart, mind and soul and you wish that the experience never ends and keeps you on the edge of the seat till the end of the movie.

Nolan has definitely added another master-piece to his ever-lasting collection and the grand finale will truly leave you spell-bound.

Christian bale as impressive as usual and Tom Hardy plays the Bane flawlessly.

Anna Hathaway does justice so as ever depending Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine. Joseph is also amazing.

Hans Zimmer music leaves is awesome which will be ringing in your ears even after you have left the cinema ! Oh boy, what we all have been waiting for is here and a must see for everyone !!!!!

One of the best trilogies ever made !

YES, THE DARK KNIGHT HAS RISEN !!!! Dey-shey dey-shey Bah-sur-rah bah- sur-rah !!!!!"
"Christopher Nolan does not make simple movie anymore, does he? I was emotionally exhausted right from the start to finish in this captivating 2 hours and 45 minutes of viewing, I barely have time to digest the richness of its storytelling and it lingered in my mind long after experienced it.

The Dark Knight Rises (TDKR) is a fitting epic ending to the most compelling, ambitious superhero movie trilogy ever. In term of audaciousness, the closest I can think of is another DC Comics, Watchmen (Snyder, 2009), without a doubt you are looking at the pinnacle of superhero comic movie adaptation in these two. Both have equal brooding style, Watchmen has a superior narrative style because it is benefited from a direct existing material while Nolan's Batman trilogy punches pure entertainment with accessibility to both general audience and comic geeks.

By the 3rd part of trilogy, gone are the days of the main characters' introduction, where we are straight to the engrossing pay off time.Batman's vehicle evolved from Tumbler who looks like tank to a two-wheels Batpod to The Bat that fly with ease (yes, Lucius Fox confirms that it comes in black colour). The story sets 8 years after the event of The Dark Knight where Bruce Wayne went into long hiatus. The newcomer Anne Hathaway plays the role of Catwoman. Under normal circumstances, she and Catwoman do not belongs to the same bracket, but somehow she pull it off with the seductive performance coupled with the touch of insecurity from her. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays as a closed aide to Commissioner Gordon. Meanwhile, Marion Cottillard is an important figure in Wayne Enterprise.

The main villain, Bane is played by Tom Hardy where his presence on the screen is downright menacing. He is physically tough and hulky. He may not be as intimidating as Joker, but somehow I fear for anyone who is near to him because he seems like he would snap the neck of the person standing next be it his henchmen or enemy. I really felt for Batman during one of the brutal knuckle fight with Bane. He absolutely gives Batman a painful thumping. On the grand scale, he masterminded a sinister plan for the downfall of Gotham City. He strikes the people of Gotham with fear, he actually gives the Gotham citizens some faint hope before striking it down with furious vengeance, all before the eyes of a helpless Bruce Wayne. Given the fleshed out background story, it is obvious Bane is the most complex villain in TDK trilogy.

I am pleased that we are now at the second decade of the golden age of superhero comic movie adaptation where there are plenty of choices we are spoilt of. The sky is the limit as far as CGI is concern, nowadays no matter how transcendent the comic is, the cinema medium just easily lift the concept from the comic book panels. While Joss Whedon's The Avengers is fun, loud, a kind of borderline juvenile stuff, TDKR on the other hand is a serious, realistic, brooding, Gothic feel drama. It stings to say this because I am a huge follower of Joss. Let me reiterate that The Dark Knight Rises is an epitome to action-orientated movie; not just limit to superhero comic adaptation genre. Whoever wants to remake a movie about Batman after Christopher Nolan, I wish him/her best of luck.

My movie review at www.sowyau.blogspot.com/"
"I would like to suggest that researching anything to deep about this film is a bad idea. Go into it with a clean slate. The experience will be ruined for you if you do not.

REVIEW IN SUMMARY:

The movie was phenomenal. It never slows, and I was surprised it was over when the time came. If you've disliked the pacing of past Nolan films, you will be fine with this one. This movie has incredible acting, a beautiful story, and is the perfect end to the Trilogy.

FULL REVIEW:

For starters, the Nolan brothers have created a masterpiece of a script. The themes explored in this film are stirring, and inspiring. The story is beautiful, and full of depth. Those of you looking for a simple mindless thriller will probably find this film to be, ""alright"", but you won't get the hype behind it. You won't understand everyone's obsession with this film. If you haven't liked Nolan's previous work, you won't like this one. It's not about the action, or the simple mindless battles many superhero movies today are all about. It's not as simple as those are. But do not despair, there is more large scale action in this then any of the other Batman films thus far.

But, it is easy to follow. Even if you haven't seen the other movies in the franchise you will understand it. The other movies add depth, so I suggest you see the other two films before you see this one, but all the same you'll be able to follow it.

Chris Nolan tells the story well. It wasn't as choppy and unorganized as some of his past films. This one is by far his best work.

Tom Hardy brings an elegance to the villain of Bane that is addicting. Yes, you read right, and elegance. Class. He is a classy villain, whose motivations are understandable, and frighteningly relatable. This is, in my opinion, his best work aside from Warrior.

As far as comparisons to the Joker go, it's like comparing an apple to an orange. Except when you bight into Bane, and the threat he presents, you'll forget the Joker even existed.

Anne Hathaway won't be disappointing. I know I, like many of you, was worried when we saw that name on the cast list. But she does fine.

This movie will stir your emotions. Satisfy your need for action. Satisfy your need for Batman. And satisfy your need for insurmountable villains. It will also satisfy those who have read the comics. Although this story does not follow in exactness to any original comic, Nolan cleverly manipulates the characters to fit the comic agenda, in a more ""modern"" or ""realistic"" sense.

This film is full of surprises. So I suggest you stop reading these reviews, avoid potential spoilers, and go enjoy the show."
"Title says it all. Epic storyline, perfect musical score, perfect acting, and one of the most emotional endings I have ever seen. This trilogy is the ""star wars"" of our generation. I'm not kidding. Oh, and for all of you IMDb users posting about the plot holes...really? People, it's called ""willing suspension of disbelief"" ever heard of it?

Go see the film and enjoy yourself. This is the one of the only action film I have seen outside of its prequel that doesn't sacrifice story for more explosions. Every character is fully realized and acts their part in such a convincing manner that they become more 3-dimensional than most characters do throughout an entire trilogy.

And Bane? Oh man, Bane is one of the best villains you will ever have the pleasure to see (and quite a well-scripted one too).

This is more than a comic-book film. This is a new classic. The Dark Knight has risen."
"Words cannot express how I felt after watching The Dark Knight Rises.. A sense of hope that even in the most dismal of situations one should have. A sense of relief that this trilogy did not go in the way of most trilogies. A sense of sadness that this would be the last batman movie in the Nolan franchise. But more than all this, I was elated and joyous about the way this movie kept my interest throughout the whole 2 hrs 45 min. To say one word about this film.. EPIC !!! . All the characters completely complimented one another. Was especially astounded by Bale, Hathaway, Hardy and Caine's performances. I am definitely going once again for this one."
"So let me start out with the negatives. This film was the least great of the three in my opinion. It had some major plot holes and confusion at the ending. But that's also something that made it great, because it is an ending that could be interpreted in different ways. So in one way, it could not be seen as a major plot hole although it has in my book. Anywho, the main antagonist Bane is one of my favorites. Find out in the film to see why, because it sure took me by a bit of surprise. On the other hand, some other appearances were quite obvious to be, but still enjoyable nonetheless. In general Christopher Nolan has made an epic trilogy that surely will stay a classic over the years to follow."
I love that this is all one big action sequence it really keeps you on your toes with a lord of the rings type war story for the climax a good movie for someone who looks for a thrill.
"First of all, when I was in the theater watching (The Dark Knight) I said to myself that there's no way I'm going to miss the next movie in this series. after the epic nature and the overwhelming performance also the art of directing that makes you live inside the movie as we have seen in The Dark Knight, I expected this one to be at least the same level and I was absolutely correct. Christopher Nolan is the best Director out there, the way he makes you become part of the movie and feel the same feeling of every character you see is just magical, and add to that the fantastic music of Hans Zimmer, not to mention the Perfect Selection of the Actors and Actresses in this movie. Before The Dark Knight all of us used to watch super hero movies and consider them the kind of thing that would never happen in real life but things changed after the epic clash between batman and the Joker, The Dark Knight Rises even make it more reasonable it makes you think that if there was a batman he would be exactly like this. and it is being proved in each scene as you go through the movie, how hard it is to live with the cruelty of bane, how it is really hard to find weapons and devices to use that they use everything they got (unlike other action movies that everyone suddenly have a 100 gun when it is time to fight) it is like what would really happen if Bane came to your city and Batman was to defend it. in other words you can call this movie a masterpiece,if you didn't watch it yet then what are you waiting for?"
"As everyone i went to this movie with lot of expectations,you know what? Nolan has done an unimaginable Batman movie which can be done only by him. He is a master in what he does.Coming to the movie,from the first frame the movie was absorbing and mind blowing. The Character of Bane was portrayed brilliantly. All the characters does their part 10/10.The twists in the story were awesome and was absolutely unpredictable.The Visual Effects were way too good. Lots of humor in the movie when compared to previous Nolan movies.The combination of classy dialogs and performance of the actors make it the best movie of Nolan so far.To end NOLAN DOES IT AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!:)"
"Immediately, probably, it should be stipulated that I'm not a fan of superhero films, I'm not a fan of comics, and even from cartoons, I'd rather have chosen ""Tom and Jerry"" than a cartoon about Batman. But despite all the first two films of the trilogy described above, I liked them very much. The reason for this is probably the cool, noir atmosphere of Gotem created by the directors, the fine acting and, of course, the good script stories. Well, after such a long introduction, it is logical to ask the question, what about the third part? Nothing! Absolutely nothing! In the final part of the trilogy there is absolutely nothing that I liked in the first two previous parts of the trilogy. The weakest part of the film is probably the script, and this fact is very surprising, as Christopher in all his works spent a lot of time developing the script (which is only the scenario of ""Memento""). Think about the reasons why the script in this picture is so weak you can endlessly. It is worth saying that most of the film is trying to build an exhibition, to reveal the main actors, but the author does not get it in the end, half the time is incredibly boring watching. So the script is so drawn and adjusted for the denouement that it's simply impossible not to notice it, it simply contradicts all laws of logic and healthy meaning. The performances of some scenes are very depressing, many battle scenes also give up cretinism, and it is not clear how they can be looked at. Yes, in the end, Christopher prepared his own story twist, but even he did not work and was predictable and boring. And as for the final scenes, I'm sorry, I could not stand it, how much forgiveness do I have to spit on all the laws of physics, science and just common sense, what would come up with this ?! Well, in general, with the plot all. The second question that arose after watching where the atmosphere of Gotham City had gone? Yes, she just took and evaporated not that noir style for which I loved the first two films of the trilogy, now Gotham is an ordinary boring metropolis, which is simply not interesting to watch. Why was this done or why? There are no answers, alas, it's sad. Well, the last point is an actor's game. Yes, I did not expect something outstanding. In principle, there was nothing outstanding on the screen, all that was that good actors gave out a good game and in sum with the above described it looked again extremely boring and not interesting. It's time to sum up and draw some conclusions. This picture is the weakest in the filmography of a good director Christopher Nolan. As it is not surprising, but basically the script was let down, of course, as a result of which the whole film is simply impossible to watch, the atmosphere and appeal were lost as in the two previous parts of the trilogy. Who can recommend this film, well, probably only to fans of superhero cinema and comic book fans. To all other lovers of good cinema, this film is by no means worth watching. I have everything."
"In my opinion I think this is the best movie of Nolan's Batman trilogy. It's more interesting, enjoyable and emotional. The acting performance is brilliant and the cast has been chosen perfectly. The end is one of the most beautiful endings I've seen, it's phenomenal and remarkable. All things about this movie will still in my memory because it's simply a great masterpiece and I really loved it. Finally if you haven't seen this trilogy yet then I can definitely recommend it."
"I feel The Dark Knight Rises is the best of Nolan's Trilogy in overall entertainment. The hallmark of this series is its dark, gritty realism, at least as realistic as you can get for a superhero movie. I prefer this approach to the semi-goofy style of the 1989-97 series.

Bane's a formidable villain and Anne Hatheway surprisingly plays a good ""Catwoman"" (I say ""surprisingly"" only because I thought she has too innocent/sweet of a quality to pull off the role). Also on hand is Marion Cotillard, who's stunning as Miranda Tate, and Joseph Gordon-Levite, who's effective as police officer Blake. Beyond these we get the principal characters/cast of the first two films, minus the Joker and Harvey Dent.

My only beef with this series is that the plots are convoluted and there's an overload of characters, which means you really have to pay attention or you'll get lost in the process. This is never a problem when a story is ultra-compelling, but none of these films are, although ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is definitely the most compelling of the three. This factor is what keeps this series from being great in my opinion.

But don't take that the wrong way; I'm just being honest. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a quality Batman film.

The film runs 165 minutes and was shot in Pittsburgh (Gotham City), England, Scotland, India, Italy, New York, Newark and California.

GRADE: B+"
"Bane, who sounds like modern day activists who claims to give authority to everyone, wants to distribute everything to everyone and ends up making them indirectly slaves of the authority. On the other hand it shows Bruce really becoming the hero without mask, he learns that fear is good to have as it makes one stronger and vigilant. The way this story is narrated is surreal. For me this is the peak Batman. The character arcs are shown in way, where you can connect with them, the way it shows that all you need is courage to fight the tyranny and heroes do have flaws too. Such superhero movies are gone now in the era of over preaching content and heavy visuals."
Catwoman was mind-blowing..! I saw 3 together..batman begins...dark knight ..and dark knight rises..as per rating dark knight is the best...but in my point of view...this is the best......loved the theory
"The Dark Knight Rises, though not as good as the previous one- The Dark Knight, is fitting for the series finale. In this one, you have Bane and he has great presence throughout the movie and good rivalry with Batman. This one is more about the story and I felt as though this was closer to Batman Begins, as if completing a full circle. In BB, we had Bruce Wayne transform into the Batman and here too he again ""learnt"" to be Batman. He realized that after 8 years of no life at all, he couldn't just don the mask and the cape and become Batman. He again faces fear, learns to overcome it and gets his training in a way.

This movie had a feeling of completeness which is very necessary when the series has ended. The Dark Knight ends in Batman being villain in people's eyes and in this one he literally ""rises""."
This film has the misfortune to be a sequel to one of the greatest films of all time. The Dark Knight is no easy act to follow. However Nolan does an amazing job of adding spectacle to make the final installment of the trilogy memorable. The realism has always made this series stand above the rest. Are there some plot holes? Yes. Do they make it a bad film? No. Go watch Justice League then honestly tell me TDKR is bad. It's not. It is simply over shadowed by its predecessor.
Oh my god this movie was awesome !.and what an amazing ending to a superb trilogy.this movie Can't get better the story the cast everything is just too perfect.and no one is better than Chrestian Bale for this movie he is a very talented actor with a really special acting skills.i am confused why anyone well hate this movie its one of the best movie for all ages ! in my opinion its the best action movie of 2012.and of course the well directing and superb special effects of the movie makes it more amazing.what a blockbuster movie is this.this movie is no doubt a most watch and best of the year and it deserved an Oscar at least.
"Christopher Nolan concludes his epic vision of the Batman franchise in high style, as Christian Bale returns as the caped crusader, after masked henchman Bane threatens to destroy Gotham. This stuff is candy for superhero aficionados, and Nolan manages to balance a large cast without shortchanging anyone. Drawn from his slumber by mysterious cat burglar Selina Kyle, the Batman faces what may be his biggest and most dangerous test yet as Bane wields a nuclear explosive and threatens to detonate. Secrets from the past are revealed, and loose ends tied. Tremendous support from Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Mariana Cotilliard, and others. This is a film to make you stand up and cheer. Fun comic fable, perhaps not up to the standard of the prior classic, but does amazing things with it's large budget and well worth viewing."
"The action was pretty mediocre at best. The plot was decent but most things were pretty predictable. Even the ""surprise"" evil villain at the end was predictable. During the movie I turned to my girlfriend and said ""$20 says she ends up being a bad guy at the end."" needless to say I got a pat on the head later.

Is the movie good? Yes. Is the movie great? Depends.... it is great for the fans of the movies but in general its not a masterpiece. I feel it deserve a 8 on IMDb at the very best. The fact that its so high rated right now is pretty unrealistic.

Everyone saying Bane was the greatest villain of all time with amazing acting? I disagree... I still think Heath did a better job as the Joker. I feel Bane was a cool character but I don't feel he at all lived up to the hype provided in other reviews.

The movie is a must see for the year, but it is something you can watch on DVD and still get the same effect. No idea how they spent so much money on this movie... the action wasn't that good."
"Christopher Nolan is the greatest film maker of all time. Big statement, I know. But let's think about that statement for a second... he has not made a bad film (Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins, The Prestige, The Dark Knight, Inception and his earlier work Following) So how does such a brilliant film maker finish off a trilogy that changed super hero movies forever, which included one of the greatest films (in any genre - The Dark Knight) of all time?

The Dark Knight Rises is the conclusion the trilogy deserves. Is it better than The Dark Knight? That's debatable. It's a very different type of movie. But it is the movie that was needed to end this trilogy, it's the movie that Batman fans will appreciate and love for years and years to come.

Christopher Nolan has just possibly made the greatest movie trilogy of all time."
"The unprecedented fervor surrounding the release of the final Batman film of Christopher Nolan's highly acclaimed trilogy is something we probably should have seen coming. Fans of the films are rabid about the movies getting their just dues, and it's become the (unfortunate) habit of many a fanboy to go ballistic on anyone who is a naysayer. That said, these people are devotees of the series for a reason: each of the two previous offerings have been nothing short of fantastic, and there was no reason to believe that the third—and final—installment, The Dark Knight Rises, would be any different.

The question that's on everyone's mind, of course, is if it really does meet (and ultimately exceed) the impossibly high standards set by its predecessors. The answer is a resounding ""yes."" The Dark Knight Rises is incredibly ambitious and incredibly satisfying; it's also the best film of the trilogy.

Allow me to explain why.

In both Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, Gotham was in peril. Madmen assailed the city's citizens for varying reasons—some more concrete than others—while a troubled hero in Bruce Wayne sought to use his resources (namely access to incredibly advantageous weaponry and a whole slew of kick-assery he obtained while a brief member of the League of Shadows) to disarm those would see the town destroyed. While his character has always been interesting, Bruce Wayne hasn't been a truly engrossing dramatic figure. That all changes with The Dark Knight Rises.

Here, we see Bruce/Batman's tragedy and redemption come around full circle. At the start of the movie, Wayne is a man crippled by the exploits he's undertaken as the caped crusader. He's a recluse who's holed up in Wayne Manor. As we're allowed to see him move beyond exchanging witty barbs with his longtime butler (and caretaker) Alfred Pennyworth, the emotional pay-dirt finally emerges, and the character—in the words of the late Ra's Al Ghul—becomes more than just a man. He becomes the embodiment of grief; here, it's clear that there's a tangible psychological block that's eating Bruce from the inside out. The first hour of Rises is devoted to mining this pain, and it makes Bale's portrayal of Bruce more accessible than ever.

Then there's the action, which hits its stride about halfway through the production. Once it gets going, it's relentless and, for lack of a better word, harrowing. Everything that's happening in the streets of Gotham has weight behind it, as the city faces a challenge unlike anything that's come before.

I feel like I'm on the verge of spilling the beans about some major plot points, so I'll wind things down by saying that the supporting cast—Tom Hardy as Bane and Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle—are all splendid. They each bring something crucial to their characters, and not a moment of screen time is wasted.

I don't need to tell you this, but if you haven't already purchased your ticket for Nolan's epic conclusion to what will go down as one of the best trilogies in movie history, then you need to get on the ball. After all, this is one of those rare occurrences in cinema—the emergence of a truly great movie that actually lives up to every ounce of hype.

Nicely done, Mr. Nolan. You deserve the Oscar nods that are surely coming your way."
"Never has a comic book film make you care about the main character especially throughout a trilogy, these movies should be viewed as one big film, it all adds up and comes to full circle in this one. The acting alone in this movie hits you hard and when Bane appears on the screen it's nail biting. From Christian Bale, Tom Hardy, Ann Hathaway, Michael Caine, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Gary Oldman the list goes on and they make this movie well worth it.

You really feel for Bruce Wayne the most in this movie (because its a batman film) and the ending has the best pay off ever and is very emotional and satisfying. One of the best things about this movie is when you watch it more than once you pick up on things you may have missed which i find more gratifying in a movie, its like watching it all over again and those movies to me are the best, its definitely not a one and done type of movie so you get your moneys worth. This movie definitely deserves the praise it has. Its going to be a long time until someone makes a comic book trilogy as brilliant as this one. Thank you Nolan."
"The special fx and action scenes were cool. The acting by the badguy was not that great. One of the reasons for that was the mask he is wearing. You cant really see the facial expressions and also the voice acting was clearly recorded in studio afterwards. The bad guy visually looking is really cool. The badguy is not that great compared to the previous movie where heat ledger really carried the movie, tom hardy doesn't. Also the storyline and screenplay wasn't that good. They tried to put to much info in to short a time. The characters where a bit shallow because of that, they lacked depth. All in all the movie was entertaining, but not as much as expected."
"First things first. Bane is not the Joker. While the Joker was chaotic,Baneis a mercenary. Ruthless and destructive. When the prologue was shown during MI4, many had voiced concerns about the muffled voice of Bane.That has been corrected to an extent.For those who don't follow comic books,Bane is the villain who broke the bat. And Tom Hardy has done justification to Bane. Mind you when there is a mask covering your face and you sound as a megaphone, it makes your job a little difficult. But his physical presence and his eyes expresses what needs to be expressed.

Before you walk into the theatre, ensure that you seen the previous two films from the trilogy as the story of TDKR is interconnected to both and you may feel lost if you haven't seen them. For those who have , it wouldn't harm to review those films again. Whilst The Dark Knight earned respect and love from worldwide audience mostly due to fact that Heath Ledger was brilliant as the Joker. And his character shines way above Batman's or the story itself, TDKR on the other hand relies more on the story and the inter-relationship of the characters.

Nolan stands true to his word. It is an EPIC conclusion to the Batman trilogy. it is worthy of multiple viewings and I would suggest an IMAX viewing if possible. The scenes, the canvas are breathtaking. So are all the action scenes and of course Mr.Zimmer on the keyboard. The soundtrack fits right into the scenes and enhances the visual experience. The newly added star cast further adds to that experience and fit right into the master puzzle that Nolan has created while his old allies ensure that the movies moral compass is pointed in the right direction. The movie justifies its length of 165 mins and you won't realise how fast they went.

For me the experience would have been far more richer had I not seen Inception or any other Nolan films. Let me explain. Many of the movie scenes are executed and directed on the same lines as Inception. And since I understand how Nolan's concept works, I knew all the twist and turns before they were revealed barring one. The element of surprise wasn't there for me. TDKR is a must watch. And it is a just end to the best comic book adapted movie series ever. Enjoyed it and loved it. Rating 8/10."
"Following a movie event like Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" (2008) is a dangerous game, but then Nolan is a dangerous player. His curious obsession with masculine identity, psychological schisms and the dark night of the soul gave ""Batman Begins"" (2005) a sense of edgy 'reality' that ingratiated him to critics and a good deal of the public, even if it alienated some hard-core Batfans with its customized and highly Nolan-esque take on the Caped Crusader. When his second installment braved the frontier of openly post-9/11 superhero parables, and in so doing gave the late Heath Ledger platform to truly wow audiences and critics the world over, the British director seemed to have galvanized 'superhero noir' as the new benchmark in comic book film adaptation. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012) is his final word on the subject, and while this reviewer feels that it is not a film fit to win over any dissenters or greatly deter any fanatics, it is very largely successful in what it tries to do and its failings are certainly not for a lack of trying.

The first hour or so of the film is a whirlwind of plot necessities that, despite the running time of 165 minutes, probably needed another half an hour or so to unfold with sensicality. They involve introductions to John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) - a rookie cop raised in a city orphanage who apparently ""still believes in the Batman"", even though as far as the audience is concerned he may as well have just moved to Gotham last week – Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) – a cat-burglar who is therefore Catwoman – and Miranda Tate (Marion Cottilard) – a high society Gothamite monetarily invested in a renewable energy program at Wayne Enterprises that has apparently gone bust, even though it seems to work just fine. Excusing a twist in the tale that seems to be there for its own sake, however, Nolan and his co-screenwriter (also known as his brother Jonathan) do not really abide loose ends, and by the commencement of the film's some hour-long climax all the story elements that feel disparate and murky in the beginning have intertwined and solidified into the kind of philosophically powerhouse narrative that made the first two films so effective.

What makes the Nolan films effective is how they appropriated the inalienable tenets of the Batman legend in pursuit of an apocalyptic allegory about the post-9/11 western world. ""Batman Begins"" was a film about fear; the double edged nature of fear's power over a people and how the conquering of fear is invaluable for the pilgrimage of moral valor. ""The Dark Knight"" was a film about Terror, the kind George Bush Jr. declared war against in the early twenty-first century, and about how the greatest tool against Terror is the adherence to moral principles, even if sacrifice and compromise must be allowed for.

""The Dark Knight Rises"" provides a more accurate depiction of terroristic motives in its central villain of Bane than the ""The Dark Knight"" did with The Joker, because he holds Gotham in contempt for its status as a symbol of American first-world 'imperialism'. There has been some critical backlash against Bane as a Villain Without A Face, but this severely undermines Tom Hardy's performance, which actually achieves remarkable presence through nothing but body-language, vocal theatricality and disturbingly expressive eyes. Even without a face, Hardy effortlessly paints a convincing portrait of one who wants to dismantle the lie of Harvey Dent's legacy and incite Gotham into class-warfare riots. He purports to ""liberate"" Gotham's people, but his ultimate goal is to feed Gotham false hope before destroying the whole darn thing and everyone in it. Bane's genuine ideological conflict with western civilization is centered around the power of hope in the eventuation of despair. More than it is a film about fear or Terror, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a film about hope.

In accord with the rest of the trilogy, Bruce Wayne is not the only protagonist whose arc is built around the movie's central thematic concepts. Even the arc supplied for Selina Kyle ends up justifying her seemingly arbitrary insertion into this filmic imagining by providing a suitably dubious object of moral faith for the fallen Dark Knight. She begins with similar outlook to Bane, but the Nolans don't buy into Ra's Al Ghul's assertion that criminals aren't complicated. Everyone, and everything, is complicated.

Oddly enough, it's this principle that is behind most of the shortcomings of the film. It's a little *too* complicated, with the rushed series of first-act events seriously paling in comparison to the emotional impact of the conclusion, and an aforementioned twist that doesn't make much sense. There are also a lot more impossible feats performed by Bruce Wayne here than before, including a near-superhuman healing ability. And where ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"" stood alone very effectively, one can't help but feel that both films are practically required viewing for this one.

But none of that really outweighs the sheer, touching veracity of this finale and its philosophical/moral ambitions, which are all up to par with the predecessors and pay off a great deal of things with a genuine craftsmanship. This ""Batman"" series has always been about the power of symbols in a corrupted world and personal accountability in a society of structural shackles, and when Batman returns to Gotham at the top of the final act to brand his symbol in flames upon the city's largest bridge structure, we are reminded of the paradoxical purity of his message. Even as part of a system that is broken, even funded by a wealth that would perhaps do more good dispersed amongst the third world, even if no one ever knows his name, the Batman fights for the goodness of fallen people (be they cops, cat-burglars or orphans) who may otherwise have never had the chance to rise."
"This movie has everything you could want all while wrapping up one of the best film trilogies. As far as bad guys go Bane is pretty much the epitome of the character type. I personally feel the villains in the trilogy is what makes them so special. The story is great and engaging, it was so good I didn't even realize that the runtime was over 2 hours. If you like dark, gritty, and/or action movies its a must watch. Also it should be noted that you should watch the first 2 films in the series otherwise some stuff might not add up. It wraps up everything in the trilogy and answers pretty much every question you could have. How it relates back to the first movie is quite impressive and after watching this one you'll probably try your best 'bane impression.' His voice is as memorable as his stature. So even if you don't like Batman you must watch it for Bane because he is that amazing. Props to Tom Hardy on his out of the park performance."
"First of all, can I say that when I heard that the Joker wasn't going to be in this movie and that the lead ""bad guy"" was going to be Bane I was thinking ""LAME"". So I tried to go into watching this film with an open mind and I got to say I won't question Chris Nolan's casting, direction or choice of characters again anytime soon. The man is a master and did a masterful job in this third installment of the Batman saga. Bane is an enemy in which Batman has not yet seen, he's physically strong sure but his genius and ruthlessness is truly what's terrifying. He breaks Batman time and again until you almost question whether Batman can really beat him in the end (which is saying something, because we all know he has to right?). The choices of the other actors like Anne Hathaway were spot on, she was magnificent and nailed the cat women character this movie required to succeed. Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Christian Bale were their own usual selves (exceptional) and I really didn't see anyone miscast or turn in anything other then a very strong performance. Overall this movie left me completely happy, the perfect ending to the perfect movie saga. These are not just great super hero movies, to me they're great films period."
"The Dark Knight Rises was my favorite film of the year and from the Dark Knight trilogy.I was looking forward to this movie and it didn't disappoint me.

Positive:epic action scenes ,great acting performances, very good villain emotional ending ,inspiring movie

Negative: some plot wholes that didn't affect me.

Overall the movie was fantastic and I think that it is the one of the best movies ever made.Long live the Batman! Eight years on, a new evil rises from where the Batman and Commissioner Gordon tried to bury it, causing the Batman to resurface and fight to protect Gotham City... the very city which brands him an enemy"
"Am not a great FAN of Super Hero movies, but Nolan Changed the entire mindset. Of course the Film has a lot of loop holes and glitches but that doesn't take away the edge of the seat thrilling heartbeat experience. What i loved most was the way a simple comic story was presented on the screen. I really appreciate Nolan's creativity and presentation.What one needs was an awesome experience and not 100% logic to Action movies. The film stand all amid all minor glitches. The film has a lot of positives, The way Bruce & Tom Hardy character was portrayed, The way Real New York city was presented, The way the Whole experience stood at the end especially Bruce climbing out of the Well. Hans Zimmer Played a wonderful part in giving a master piece. All in All i would recommend everyone to watch whether they like it or not but for the cinematic experience it gives in the end. A Comic Super Hero Movie depicted magnificently after a lot of flops earlier. Nolan has silently conveyed that he is the right man who can do it."
"I just love a good superhero movie, so I happily saw the two Tim Burton offerings (""Batman"" & ""Batman Returns"") and even the pair of inferior Joel Schumacher works (""Batman Forever"" & ""Batman & Robin"") before thoroughly enjoying the British director Christopher Nolan's ""Batman Begins"" (2005) and ""The Dark Knight"" (2008). Four years later, Nolan - who again co-wrote and co-produced - is back with the final and longest part of his acclaimed trilogy. The expectations were very high and Nolan does not disappoint (and deserves particular thanks for not using 3D).

The opening sequence - which I saw in an early trailer - is terrific and almost the best thing in the film and Nolan makes sure that the rest of the story races along with verve and tension, aided by Hans Zimmer's incessant, throbbing score.

It's eight years after the last film and Bruce Wayne (once more the talented Christian Bale) is a broken man, physically, psychologically and even financially. Two contrasting characters arrive in Gotham City to draw him out of retirement: a slinky cat thief (well played by Anne Hathaway who has the most humorous lines) and arch villain Bane (a fearsome-looking Tom Hardy whose lines are unfortunately muffled by his face mask). The Bane character may not be in quite the same chilling class as the brilliant Heath Ledger as The Joker, but Catwoman is a splendid addition to the cast list.

I didn't always understand what was going on - a recent viewing of the two previous films might have helped (who remembers the League of Shadows?) - and I saw it with a friend who was enjoying it for the second time and found the plot more intelligible, so that may be encouragement - if any was needed - to catch it again sometime. But the film always looks wonderful and the action is exciting and unrelenting, satisfyingly alternating from brutally visceral fighting between Batman and Bane to the deployment of some heavy hardware including a bat bike and a bat helicopter.

So, now that Nolan has triumphantly completed his trilogy, does this mean that the crusader is hanging up his cape? No way. The money to be made by continuing the franchise and the setting up of the Robin character (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) means that some other director will soon receive the call from Warner Brothers ..."
"""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012) is the third and final film in Christopher Nolan's trilogy about the comic book superhero Batman, created in 1939 by Bill Finger and Bob Kane. The franchise, starting in 2005 with ""Batman Begins"" and continuing in ""The Dark Knight"" (2008) is brought to a conclusion, and traditional Hollywood thinking is used by the Warner Bros. Studio here: everything is bigger, louder and more explosive and with higher stakes than before. Yet this expansionism hasn't translated into greater quality; if anything, it is the most flawed of the trio. Continuity errors, plot holes and logic defying events plague the film incessantly. The screenplay, by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, feels like it is two or three drafts away from being a finished product. Geopolitical significance is constantly strived for, especially in the latter part of the film, yet it fails to fully grasp its own half-articulated ideas and ends feeling like the pat, smug ""safe"" hawkish ideologies of a studio executive more interested in profit margins than ideas. All these mistakes are a repetition of the previous entry in the series; in many ways this perfectly encapsulates Hollywood: nothing forgotten, nothing learnt.

Still, Nolan's direction is as impressive as ever, really delivering in the large scale set pieces that dot the picture. He brings a real energy to the screen that almost papers over the cracks in the story. The dynamic action scenes are hardly original though and the opening sequence is straight out of a James Bond movie.

The acting is generally of a high standard, with Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Tom Hardy all very good. Unfortunately, the Oscar winning Marion Cotillard is given nothing to do and struggles to create a performance out of a poorly written character.

The cinematography by Academy Award winner Wally Pfister is good and a cut above the usual standard found in the average superhero blockbuster, the same of which can be said for the editing by Lee Smith and the booming music score of Hans Zimmer.

If then this climax to the Batman series is a disappointment, torpedoed by a below par script, then at least Christopher Nolan directs so well that you will be immersed in the film to the point where perhaps you will be more forgiving of its flaws and be swept along by this enjoyable spectacle."
"Wow. Christoper Nolan's third Batman-film is certainly not praised without good reasons, I assure you. The film leaves you speechless, the action combined to great actors and twisty plot, it's just pure beauty. Cannot say any negative thing about this film. Was surpirsed to see so many great actors, including old Stargate-star Christopher Judge in the side role. Can't give away much, so I'm not writing any more. I'm just saying, watch it as soon as you can!"
"The disappointment of the year. could not imagine the duo of nolan brothers getting it wrong. this movie should have been titled "" Cat woman and Bane"" because Batman is just an impotent shadow of his old time over here. Cat woman aka Selina Kyle is given the major amount of the screen time and Hathway is a pretty competent Catwoman. Bane(Tom Hardy) is unfortunately all masked up so he can convey the menace only from the way he walks or talks in that Irish lilt. Michael Caine is excellent in the scenes he is in and so is Morgan Freeman. Marion cotillard is totally wasted. i could not really understand the necessity for her character in the movie and also could not fathom why an Oscar winning actor like her would go for such a two bit role. Joseph Gordon Lewitt creases his forehead throughout the movie and that is pretty much all he does. Christian Bale is above average but he cannot lift a screenplay which is weak and predictable from the very beginning. the only bright spot about the movie is its music which is better than the previous installments. This movie is a disappointment when considered in seclusion. when compared with The Dark Knight and Batman Begins, it is a f**king disaster. very very unhappy."
"That Completes the trilogy.. Just came out from 'The Dark Knight Rises'...Not as mesmerizing as The Dark Knight ,but still Christopher Nolan executed a legendary ending to the series with breathtaking visual moments and fine performances..the movie takes off slowly ,bt the racy 2nd half s just stunning...Hans Zimmer 's score is brutal, percussive and ma ear drums was busting , the Bane Chant wherever he used was goosebumps..Christian Bale continued his legacy in the third part too.. Tom Hardy was a beefy substitute for Heath Ledger in a hell of a villain as the merciless and destructive evil.. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman reprise's there roles as strong as it's been throughout the series.. Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a fair job as the detective and he s a promising actor and the shocking 'Rise' was Marion Cotillard as 'Miranda Tate'..Anne Hatheway as CatWoman was just a sidekick and nothing much performance wise from her We may never see superhero films quite like these again, and that's fine.Nolan had ended on his own terms..If plans arise to reboot the ""Batman"" films a few years from now, I wish you luck. The bar is as high as it could possibly be... Must Watch for all Dark Knight and Nolan and movie lovers..!!"
"one of the most rewarding movies not only for having a realistic life story but also for watching a true hero who gets up on his feet at the end regardless how badly hurt ed he was he's still there

a true hero don't always have to had super powers but rather a Strong willing heart to take the right decisions at the right time & knows when to quit.

never give up

accept the truth about your self

even super heroes must know the feeling of fear sometimes to be true heroes"
"Billionaire Bruce Wayne once said, ""I am moreit's what you do that defines you."" The question is: what defines us all? The fire has risen and that fire has been put out, but not yet though. One thing still remains: Is there a future for the billionaire playboy? Enough about playboys, let's chat about how we got here.

In 2005, we were re-introduced to a boy who fell down a well and we saw what frightened him the most – bats. But he overcame that fear and struck fear into the hearts of those that knew the very existence of fear. Fighting against the mob, Batman took down the biggest crime lords of Gotham City – Carmine Falcone and gave the Scarecrow a taste of his own medicine.

But in 2008, the war was not over, not even by a landslide. As Bruce Wayne was having battles of his own, Batman was posed as a threat to the city and plus a mastermind of theatricality, a brain as the size of a laughing matter, brought a new taste in life – SLAUGHTER WAS THE BEST MEDICINE! The Joker (RIP Heath!), portrayed one of the darkest villains of all time as he brought down upon the city and the new DA Harvey Dent and gave the word ""light"" a new name.

Now we come to 2012, no one expected this to come to a conclusion, we thought we were in it for the long haul. Let's just say it was bittersweet and a whole lot of punches and back breaking. The ultimate villain, Bane, gave violence a new name. A name that was synomous unlike any other. But Bane was not working alone. An arch-enemy came back to finish a job but through someone else. And the black was faded and billionaire was living his life and moving on. But wait something red approaches, something that will fly red colors – is it a red monster, is it a red wagon, no it is a RED ROBIN.

For 8 years, the mastermind of Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathon gave Batman a new look and took the story to a whole new level. Thank you for teaching us that it is what we do that defines us. Christian Bale – you gave us an icon to live up to, you taught us to live for ourselves. Thank you. From Cillian Murphy to Tom Wilkinson to the late Heath Ledger to Aaron Eckhart to Tom Hardy to Anne Hathaway to Marion Cotillard – you guys defined evil. Thank you.

Batman will live in our hearts for years to come."
"I'll start by saying two things: 1. I am a huge Batman fan, in all shapes and sizes (well, except the Joel Schumacher movies); I read the comics, watched the animated series and movies and the live action movies 2. I am intelligent enough to spot plot holes, unrealistic action scenes and 'forced' plot devices.

With those disclaimers in mind, most people who criticize this film would imagine I must hate it. And, yet, it's quite the opposite.

I've just finished watching this for the 3rd time in 2 years. Yes, it's true that, the more often you watch it, the easier it is to spot things that seem off. To look at the details and to start questioning.

But...I really don't care. None of that makes this movie any less special for me. Because, truly, this movie goes to such emotional depths and gets you so in touch with the heart of what it means to be the Batman, that anything else is overshadowed.

The appeal and curse of Batman as a character is that he is human. He suffers and makes mistakes. He can be broken. He doesn't have super strength or the ability to fly. What he does have, beyond the training and the money and being 'the world's greatest detective', is his determination. His unwavering motivation to fight and win for his cause, to make Gotham safe at any cost. That's his superpower - never giving up.

And, on top of that, he has a lot of pain and trauma; the kind that any human being will experience, at some point in their life, that is now out in the open for anyone to sympathize with.

For capturing those things and putting them on screen so beautifully, I am grateful to Mr. Nolan."
"The Dark Knight Rises (2012) is my third best movie. Anne Hathaway was awesome fantastic as Catwoman she portrayed her by comic books the way she was. Michelle Pfeiffer did not do the job by portraying Catwoman by comic books but she did knew how to hit back. Bane played by Tom Hardy was absolutely fantastic terrorist. The Dark Knight Rises is pretty good awesome movie! The third Christopher Nolan film is very bashed and criticized by fan boys of Burton films saying it isn't good as Burton Batman films were. I love The Dark Knight Rises a little much better than Batman Returns, but those 4. films I reviewed will be my four favorite films. Schumacher films suck and they aren't my favorite films.

Anne Hathaway's performance is a worth of watch in this movie. Selina Kyle was written straight from the comic books the way her origins were. I love her in this movie she was well portrayed by Anne Hathaway, the way she was written in a comic books. Christian Bale still lighten us all up in his performance as Batman/Bruce Wayne. Matthew Modine and Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a wonderful performances in their co starring roles. This movie still has a plot holes like Batman dies in the end but he doesn't, Bruce Wayne survives. Alfred disappears magically during half of this movie and he show's up on the end of the movie. Anne Hathaway did a much, much better job than Michelle Pfeiffer did. Bane was a scary villain but still a good comic book portrayed villain the way he was. Tom Hardy was truly great in his performance as the main villain Bane. Seriously I have enjoyed this movie much better as a I did Batman Begins. Still The Dark Knight is the best one of all Batman Films. A good conclusion to end the trilogy.

The Dark Knight Rises is a 2012 British-American epic superhero film directed by Christopher Nolan, who co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Jonathan Nolan, and the story with David S. Goyer. Featuring the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the final installment in Nolan's Batman film trilogy, and the sequel to Batman Begins (2005) and The Dark Knight (2008).

Taking place eight years after the events of ""The Dark Knight"", the film follows Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) once more as he is forced to come out of self-imposed exile when a new evil rises in Gotham. This time around, the Caped Crusader must face off against his most dangerous enemy yet, a ruthless masked crime lord known as Bane (Tom Hardy), who will stop at nothing to bring chaos to the city. He must also deal with the arrival of a mysterious cat burglar named Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), as well as his inner demons. He may have defeated the Joker, but does Batman even stand a chance against Bane?

Eight years after the Joker's reign of anarchy, the Dark Knight is forced to return from his imposed exile to save Gotham City from the brutal guerrilla terrorist Bane with the help of the enigmatic Catwoman.

It's hard to imagine a time when a Christopher Nolan-helmet Batman film wasn't a sure thing. Yes it does.

Warner Bros. Pictures' and Legendary Pictures' ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is the epic conclusion to filmmaker Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy.

Christopher Nolan's concluding vision of the legendary Caped Crusader may just possibly go down as one of the strongest closing chapters to any franchise in modern cinema. Not only is it one of the most entertaining blockbusters of the year, but it also expands upon the Batman saga in a way that keeps you both emotionally and intellectually invested until the very end. With its top-notch performances, breathless score, solidly engrossing storyline, and action-packed set pieces, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" ends the franchise on a satisfying high note, delivering one of the most powerfully engrossing climaxes in recent memory. Anne Hathaway also deserves major props for her portrayal of the cunning Catwoman, who (in my opinion) is even more striking than Michelle Pfeiffer.

Although ""The Dark Knight Rises"" never truly reaches the same groundbreaking heights as its predecessor, I loved every minute of it. The fantastic storytelling, the gritty visuals, the brilliant character development. There's nothing here that isn't worthy of praise in my book. Nolan truly capped off his one-of-a-kind superhero trilogy in a way that no other director could've accomplished. Sure, the narrative can get a bit messy at times, but when compared to everything else the film does right, it hardly matters. I don't recommend this film , because it isn't for everyone. But for any fan of dark, gritty, action-packed filmmaking it is.

R.I.P. to all the victims of the Theater Massacre in Aurora, Colorado. They will be missed.

"The Dark Knight Rises is a 2012 action film directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Oscar-winning Christian Bale as Batman and Tom Hardy as Bane. It was a box office success with total earnings more than $1 billion.

Eight years after the events of The Dark Knight, Batman seems to have retired. But when a new evil force named Bane arrives in Gotham and intends to destroy the city, Batman has to rise again. His allies are few, but he is willing to do whatever it takes to save his city and its people...

One of the best features of the film is its special effects; also why I enjoyed it so much. They were all amazingly good, with the stadium explosion being one of the top movie scenes this year!

What's more, another point I have to mention is the acting; Bale is as convincing as ever, while Hardy is the perfect villain. The rest of the cast, including Anne Hathaway as Catwoman and Gary Oldman as Comissioner Gordon remains at its finest.

All in all, I found the film more enjoyable than any other this year. So, don't waste time-grab your popcorn, your friends and watch it. In my opinion though, you should already have done so!"
"If you've had enough of Batmen because of the likes of Val Kilmer and George Clooney, then you haven't enjoyed Christian Bale in director Christopher Nolan's trilogy of Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, and now the superior Dark Knight Rises. Bale brings the anguish and triumph of a real human being who suffers and overcomes his sorrows to fight the forces of evil—the American way.

While that way is too often by way of violence in movies, this iteration, where Bruce Wayne returns from self-exile to fight the fearful Bane (Tom Hardy), is more often punctuated by intelligence (in weapon designs and mostly in strategy). In fact, the violence is frequently mundane fist fighting, almost as if to emphasize guile over missile. Sadly, the two battles between Batman and Bane are so dull that I longed for CGI to elevate the sophistication. Body blows hardly satisfy in this high-tech world.

Characteristic of Nolan, the bad guys are memorable and formidable: Bane has a mask to remind us of Darth Vader with his power and darkness, actually coming from a pit of darkness as if from some Poe-like tale of terror; Catwoman (Anne Hathaway) is witty, slippery, and mercurial while sporting a figure Hathaway must have worked hard to fashion; and the surprise villain, well, is more vicious than the others because of the ultimate disguise (not to be disclosed here for fear of my being thrown into the naughty-critic pit).

Then there's Alfred (Michael Caine), Bruce Wayne's faithful servant, whose soul is almost as tortured as Wayne's. Caine is called on to shed a few tears, which are more believable than all the CGI machines. I wouldn't be surprised if Caine gains an Oscar nomination for supporting role (he won two Oscars already). As for Joseph Gordon-Levitt's cop, John Blake, he is subtly effective in gaining our sympathy so that he is guaranteed to return in the next Batman production.

I am unusually effusive about the acting because it is so good, but I should not forget that themes are always prominent in this series. Global financial failure, loyalties, and warfare; and, of course, the ambiguity of human beings, symbolized by masks, keep this comic-book thriller from sinking in its own weight of explosions and bombast.

The Amazing Spider-Man impressed me a few weeks ago because it caught squarely the young person's challenges of self-centered arrogance and growing maturity thorough responsibility. Now The Dark Knight Rises shows the inner struggles of an adult hero racked with doubt, more inclined to forsake responsibility than to save humanity. As for the Avengers, it now looks like a showcase for costumes at a Comic-Con convention.

Nolan and Bale have caught the angst of adults everywhere who, when confronted with financial ruin or the need to defend their turf from alien forces, may bail out rather than face down the evils. Despite the questionably-long 164 minutes, the artists of this film have kept every minute interesting, fast-paced, and highly useful to develop a pride of heroes who should keep us entertained for at least next decade."
"I went to see the Dark Knight Rises last week and I have to say I was impressed. Story-wise it's a lot better than it's predecessors. The plot is coherent and has several interesting twists along the way that I won't spoil for you here. My only complaint is that it is a bit heavy going at some points. 3 hours is a long time, and I wouldn't go so far as to say boring, but it definitely takes a while to pick up the pace. However once it does you are in for a thrill ride.

Nolan did a fantastic job with the Characters, from the troubled Bruce Wayne/Batman to Catwoman to the antagonist Bane, as well as secondary characters such as Alfred and Gordon, they are all fleshed out beautifully and are very believable in respect to the source material. Supplemented by superb acting by the all star cast, I have no complaints here.

The direction is fantastic. As I said above, it takes a while to pick up, but it never ever get's boring. As soon as you start to think that, something happens that pulls you right back in. Nolan deserves to be commended for this. The action scenes are brilliantly done, the special effects are great, Hans Zimmer's score is, as always, superb, the editing and cinematography are crisp. There really is not much to complain about here.

In my personal opinion it is the best installment in the Nolan trilogy, and if you haven't seen it yet I can only recommend you do so as soon as possible."
"Didn't think this film lived up to the hype surrounding it. It was good, don't get me wrong but it didn't compare with the Dark Knight. Seemed too full of action and definitely violence, which obscured the story somewhat.However Christian Bale played a blinder again and he has definitely made the role his and his alone. Nobody would be able to compare to him. The ending was again a bit rushed and didn't really come as any surprise, and again this let down the overall film. Sets up another series, which would have to be exceptional to compare. But overall a let down and not a fitting end to this franchise. Let's hope the Man Of Steel (another DC offering) will strengthen the comic lines takings as the Green Lantern certainly didn't. Sorry, the Avengers will be the box office topper this year!"
"A mediocre comic book film. While decent at times, there are too many patches of poor dialog the bring out poor performances from the actors. While Bruce Wayne is reluctant to put back on the bat suit, Bale seems equally reluctant to put on his Bruce Wayne suit. His performance is entirely uninteresting and he never seems to recover any fire. 

Hathaway does a fair job, but she and Bale lack chemistry. A scene with Levitt is so poorly written and performed it is painful to watch. 

Bane is never menacing. It sounds like he is impersonating Jeremy Irons from Die Hard 3. He also does this ridiculous head shake during his speech, as if to insure the audience that he is speaking. 

The tie in to A Tale of Two Cities is obvious and ham fisted.  There is so little build up to the behavior the citizens quickly adopt that  it just fails to make itself plausible. While the personal sacrifice from A Tale of Two Cities makes that story powerful, the cop out in this film weakens the whole story.  

Some of the action scenes are pretty good. Some are just ridiculous. Batman always seems like some guy in a suit who is fighting a creepy guy with a mask. 

Overall this movie just fails to ever become compelling."
"You just don't watch a Nolan movie. You experience it. Something happens inside you after you're done watching any of his movies.

The Dark Knight Rises is not just a movie, its a baggage of expectations, its a sequel to The Dark Knight, it has been directed by Chris Nolan, it has the Batman and people have already started with their assumptions and speculations.

Does the movie survive all this?

Yes. Definitely yes.

Batman Begins dealt with fear. The Dark Knight dealt with chaos. The Dark Knight Rises deals with pain.

Eight years have been passed since the demise of Harvey Dent. Batman had hung up the boots and started blaming himself for Harvey's Death and everything. With all the injuries he had sustained while fighting under that bat suit and the depression, he is no longer the Bruce Wayne Gotham knows. People have been questioning his sanity. Wayne empire is declining.

In comes Bane. The dark, brutal, masked and monolithic beast who almost destroys Wayne enterprises to seek Batman.

Selina Kyle, a female burglar who teases Bruce Wayne with her attitude and activities.

As a result, Batman is forced to come back. What follows is the series of events that not only blow your mind away but cast a magical spell to last the full life time.

There are a several new players that have been introduced in the film, such as Wayne's love interest and the new age cop John Blake who does the job of being the good side kick of Gordon and plays in an important role in convincing Bruce Wayne to be back as the caped crusader to protect Gotham one last time from the terror of Bane and army.

So is The Dark Knight Rises better than The Dark Knight? If you were one of those fans who prefer Batman Begins to TDK then you'll find much to love about TDKR. And if you weren't then no Batman film will ever match TDK for you.

As both Batman and Bruce Wayne, Christian Bale's work here is master- class, and he gives the character such an inescapable melancholy – a certain perseverance in the face of absolute resignation to his fate – that he becomes a more tragic figure than ever. That said, he's aided enormously by a never-better Michael Caine, who turns with hope and palpable love what might otherwise be expository dialogue into searing, supportive criticisms of Wayne's self-destruction.

On the other hand, after being marketed as heir to the Joker in ""The Dark Knight,"" Tom Hardy's Bane is a different sort of villain – a focused and more ideologically-developed version of Heath Ledger's Joker – but one with equally ruthless charm.

While she doesn't quite steal the show as Heath Ledger's Joker did, Hathaway's Catwoman is a magnetic presence whenever she's on screen and she has great chemistry with Bale. Selina may be the proverbial good bad girl, the thief with a heart of gold, but Hathaway imbues her with a wounded spirit and a survivor's edge that makes her feel genuine and sympathetic even when she's being naughty.

That being said, the acts of good old Gary Oldman and the power house Joseph Gordon Levitt cannot be ignored.

Christopher Nolan is in peak time of his life. Whatever he is touching is turning into gold. He has taken The Batman series to a level which no one in thousand years can reach. The action scenes, the rise and the fall of all the characters along with the climax are just the pieces of the puzzle, which in the end you feel was taking shape since the day Batman Begins released. The first hour ties all the loose ends the first two movies left behind and the climax is so apt that you leave the theater feeling contended and satisfied.

We may never see superhero films quite like these again, and that's fine. Nolan had something special to say with his time in the trenches, and he's ended on his own terms.

I wonder which series Nolan decides to reboot next!"
"Firstly I will say that I loved Batman Begins. Then Christopher Nolan gave us The Dark Knight and I felt it was on a whole other level than Batman Begins. I went into the cinema to The Dark Knight Rises on the day of release with high expectations. These were blown away! I even went to see it at the cinema again and I've never done that before! (I understand other people saw it many more times but still a first for me)

The acting was absolutely superb! Christian Bale was at his very best playing Bruce Wayne/Batman. Michael Caine was brilliant as Alfred despite his short screen time and I feel the performance was Oscar nomination worthy. Anne Hathaway was a better Catwoman than I could have imagined. Joseph Gordon Levitt was really good as Blake. Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman were good as always playing Gordon and Fox. Marion Cotillard was good as Miranda as well. Finally Tom Hardy as Bane. I thought this was good casting from the start but I never imagined something quite this good! Tom Hardy stole the show for me just like Heath Ledger did in The Dark Knight. Bane is one of my favourite baddies of all time now and while it wasn't quite as good as The Joker, it was as close as it was ever going to come. Tom Hardy is worthy of an Oscar nom for his portrayal of Bane especially since he was restricted with the mask and had to convey emotions through eyes, voice and body language. There were a few moments where I couldn't understand his voice but sometimes it just took a few extra seconds to absorb it and his voice sounds too awesome to care anyway.

Wally Pfisters cinematography was incredible once again and I think I see another Oscar nomination for him.

Hans Zimmer's score was his greatest yet in my opinion and it really added to the emotional depth of the film and just got you into the film right from the start. Dare I say it another Oscar nomination?

Finally Christopher Nolan's Direction was incredible as always and I truly believe this to be his finest creation to date and he must get an Oscar nomination if not his first win, he definitely deserves it.

Overall this film was outstanding, one of the greatest films ever made,the finest of Nolan's Batman trilogy and the best superhero movie of all time. An Oscar nomination is deserved and I think any other film coming out this year will struggle to beat it."
"Is it a perfect film? No. It is a great blockbuster? Yes, it is. Tonally, The Dark Knight Rises rises above its predecessor in the trilogy, because it manages to balance the grounded in realism and comic book aspects into a tonally coherent work. In fact, though it still attempts to ground itself in reality, this is the most operatic and most bombastic of the Batman films. And, dear lord, does operatic work with the superhero genre. After all, at its true core, Batman, and the superhero genre, is inherently a ridiculous concept. I loved the ridiculous voice of Bane and Michael Cain's constant hamming it up, crying speeches.

In recent years, the JJ Abraham's school of film-making has gained currency. The film moving so fact to one scene to the next that the audience barely has time to register the illogical steps taken by the characters. This is evident in the 2009, Star Trek film. While Nolan does this, he does it with so much more panache that it transcends the narrative, editing weaknesses associated with this modern form of film- making. The Dark Knight Rises is a pure cinematic experience. It is a film that needs It is a film that needs to be experience in the big screen. Even the hand to hand fighting sequences-- an area that Christopher Nolan has struggled with in the past -- are exemplary; they are reminiscent of the slow light saber fights in the Old Trilogy.

The biggest problem with the film is that it does not developed the relationship between Marion Colitard's character and Bruce Wayne well enough; it feels too force. Another major problem with the film is the Howard Hughes segment, it which it is they only portion of the film that drags."
"After eight years in seclusion, Batman resurfaces to face Bane, a mastermind bent on destroying Gotham and has ties to Bruce Wayne's past. Christopher Nolan's conclusion to his Dark Knight trilogy should be treated as a wrap up rather than a third installment. Despite many new characters being introduced, even their conflicts and motives are derived from events that occurred in the previous two films. Such an approach could be seen as a weakness, since the conflict could just end up being sort of a rematch rather than moving the story forward; however, Nolan's approach works terrificly. Over an hour is shot in stunning IMAX, but the film is more touching than it is intense and that's its best quality. Hardy steps in as the genius mercenary Bane, who is slightly bigger, slightly stronger and slightly smarter than Batman, thus making him a challenge best suited for the grand finale. The Joker works best as Batman's arch-nemesis since they are polar opposites, with The Joker standing for everything Batman stands against. Two-Face works best as Batman's most tragic enemy because Harvey Dent is very much like Bruce Wayne the only difference is: Dent copes with his tragedy through revenge rather than seeking justice as Wayne did. Bane works best as Batman's most challenging villain because of his physical and mental superiority—forget the Bane you saw in ""BATMAN & ROBIN"". Nolan carefully chose all his villains in the series wisely and executed them perfectly. Hardy had big shoes to fill following Ledger's posthumous Oscar winning performance; while Bane is no Joker, Hardy does a satisfying job and should not be compared to Ledger's performance as they are completely different roles. It is Michael Caine, however, that delivers the most memorable and touching performance of the entire film. A wonderful conclusion to a wonderful trilogy.

**** (out of four)"
"The Dark Knight Rises was a perfect sequel to a masterpiece. Christopher Nolan took a different direction and focused more on Bruce Wayne/Batman. This movie is filled with lots of emotions. It has such great characters and of course the dialogs is so good. The performances are incredible. It was my most anticipated movie of the century. The more I watch it, The more epic it gets. Personally, I think The Dark Knight Trilogy is the greatest Trilogy of all time and this movie gives the greatest ending of all time in the movie history. I remember seeing it thrice and the more I watched It the more respect it earns. Thank you Christopher Nolan, You Sir Are A Master."
"Possibly my personal favourite of the Nolan Batman films, and I do like Batman Begins and The Dark Knight very much. Is it perfect? For me, not quite, there are so many plot strand in a long running time that the film occasionally(and there is a big emphasis on that) sags in momentum and some of the strands in the ending could have done with more development. It is a brilliant film all the same, one of the highlights so far of the year. As to expect from Christopher Nolan, it is a visually audacious film, with gorgeous cinematography, a beautifully realised Gotham City and great special effects. Hans Zimmer's score is not one of his very best for me, but there is still an epic and haunting quality that is just perfect for this film. The dialogue provokes thought and makes an emotional impact, and a vast majority of the time The Dark Knight Rises is ambitious and gripping. I don't consider Christopher Nolan one of my favourites, this said he is a hugely impressive director who shows great ambition and a willingness to make his subject matters interesting. He does a really wonderful job here, as the set/action pieces including the plane hijack and Bane's assault on Gotham are enough to make the jaw drop. The performances are just terrific from all involved, Matthew Modine fares weakest but he is far from bad. Christian Bale is still a charismatic presence, Matthew Caine appropriately loyal and Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman subtly understated. Joseph Gordon Levitt captures his character's idealism wonderfully. Tom Hardy is in beefed-up terrifying mode as Bane, a worthy successor to Heath Ledger's iconic Joker. Anne Hathaway was a curious casting choice, but as Catwoman she is spot on, here is a Catwoman who actually does much more than acting sexy(which she still is), she is very ruthless and no-nonsense here. All in all, a hugely impressive film, the best of Nolan's Batman trilogy- though I'm prepared for any flaming I'll get for this opinion- and one of the highlights so far of 2012. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"There's a storm coming .....

Years after being villified, Batman is encouraged once again to come Gotham's aid, as it's in the grip of a group of mercenaries run by the villainous Bane.

First of all, you don't have to be a superhero fan to enjoy this great movie, it truly does have the most broad appeal, there's something here for everyone to enjoy. If you liked the two preceding films, I figure you'll love this one, I'm a fan of all three, this is my personal favourite.

It's a long movie, but it flies by at a canter, no single frame is wasted, it moves by at a terrific pace, it has incredible action sequences, but the story is terrific.

It's really interesting to see Batman coming in from a position where he's decided and feared, he's no longer accepted as Gotham's hero and saviour.

Christian Bale is the perfect Batman, and he is matched every step of the way by Tom Hardy. Hardy is off the charts as Bane, the last time we saw the character was back in The Batman and Robin film, perhaps best forgotten, here though he's an iconic villain.

I can't speak highly enough of Bale and Hardy, but this is also, I think the best of Anne Hathaway, she is excellent here.

A decade on, and this film is still fabulous.

10/10."
"Christopher Nolan's epic trilogy concludes in glorious fashion and gives us a thought provoking and suitably satisfying conclusion to an epic saga. It's emotional, intense and has a great villain in Tom Hardy."
"Not being a huge fan of superhero movies, I didn't have much expectations for Batman Begins. However viewing the 2005 Christopher Nolan production, I was pleasantly shocked. Then after my huge expectations for, ""The Dark Knight"", Christopher Nolan blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, ""The Dark Knight Rises""? Quite simply, Yes! My big expectations were once again, blown away. What a production! This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The editing, sound, score, visuals, direction and action are all top notch.

The film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Christian Bale, of course still makes is a great Batman. Michael Cain is fantastic, as he always is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be considered for an Oscar nomination. Tom Hardy as Bane is utterly terrifying, at times, and completely ominous. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman/Selina Kyle is a scene stealer. She is completely engrossing. Everyone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors are so well done, so well written, and so well directed. The Dark Knight Rises is is emotionally riveting and amazing to view.

At a running time of almost 3 hours, the film never becomes dull, which is pretty impressive. The movie's action sequences are spectacularly well created and very intense. The dialogue between the character's are intelligent and highly believable. The movie's soundtrack is terrific and really exemplify's many of the movie's scenes. Extremely well editing and sound use really develop many of the movie's action scenes, so it's not just explosions and visuals like in many other movies. Nolan creates a grand, dirty, engrossing world, and his action sequences just hum.

In conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that great writing and direction can enhance any movie-going experience, even superhero movies, which are usually thought of as mindless entertainment. I am wholly satisfied with Christopher Nolan's vision and thank all who worked on this film for bringing such an intricate interpretation of its very famous literary source. I cannot recommend this film anymore than I have, I just have to say everyone and anyone should see it. 10/10"""
"I think as a film stand point, the dark knight is a better movie that is better acted and tense the whole way through. The dark knight rises to me is a more fun and action filled movie that you can sit back a bit more. The acting is still amazing and combined with the atmosphere/visuals of the movie creates a the sense of realism that the movie has. That realism is where the intensity stems from throughout the movie, the audience believing that something like this could actually happen makes it that much scarier. Bane is also an excellent villain, in the dark knight the joker challenges Batman mentally but Bane physically challenges him which is a completely new challenge for Batman. The plot is incredible, it it starts fast and instantly brings you into the action. It then takes a step back to develop the characters further and build up the challenge Batman has to face. Once one of the many challenges was overcome by Batman in launches the viewer straight back into action for one epic final battle that lasts almost an hour......and it is GLORIOUS! Not one second was I bored, it is truly incredible how each movie in the trilogy is this good, it shouldn't be possible. I've not even mentioned the incredible soundtrack to compliment the astounding yet grounded action. I can't compliment this movie enough. If you haven't someone seen this trilogy yet....watch it, you won't be disappointed."
"I came out with slight disappointment after watching DKR for I had huge expectations from Nolan after an exceptional TDK.

I am huge fan of first two installment of Batman Trilogy. I liked DKR, it's a good movie, but it could have been much better.

So rather than discussing its merit, which are many, I am pointing out its shortcomings.

It's the weaker than other movies of trilogy and simple reason being it lacks strong characters. DKR is all about storytelling, just like Nolan's Inception, but not as efficient. And in doing so, it fails where Batman Begins and The Dark Knight had succeeded.

Batman Begins was all about fear, doubt, self-realization and redemption where Bruce Wayne discovers his destiny as Batman. BB had a story arc which set background for main characters - Batman / Wayne, Ra's al Ghul, Gordon (to some extent) and most importantly Gothom City and hence set stage for a fitting climax.

The Dark Knight explores the theme of chaos, morality and belief effortlessly and establishes characters of Joker, Harvey Dent/Two Face, Rachel etc. So effortlessly that people choose to ignore even some major plot holes. Heath Ledger's interpretation of Joker was so mesmerizing that it single handily carried TDK to path of greatness/ critical acclaim.

But Dark Knight Rises is all about story telling - efficient but not exceptional. Bane, Miranda Tate, John Blake, Peter Folly (Deputy Commissioner), Selina Kyle - characters are introduced but never explored/ expanded - they just start working on their part - just like cogs in the wheel. They are not so much part of the story itself but just the agents which move the story forward.

Bane's character is dull and single dimensional and do not evoke any fear or awe. He's meticulous, intelligent and strong and this is established quickly in movie but after that he slumps into a just another movie villain. Taila / Miranda character is never fully explored. Even Wayne/Batman is devoid of any emotions in this one and he feels so sure of himself that I start wondering if it's the same Batman that I saw in first two installments. Only new character which had some shades was that of Selina Kyle and Anne Hathaway did justice to it. Add to that helplessness of Alfred portrayed superbly by Caine. Other actors are good but there's not much for them to do.

There's no dilemma, choices, moral battles, hope, chaos or fear - things that make characters and plot interesting and which made Batman Begins and The Dark Knight really good movies. Even the theme of ""Occupy WallStreet"" is very weak and, at best, is closer to London riots with its looting and arson. There's even perfect order in Bane's revolution. Movie moves effortlessly from one plot to another and to climax that it become at times predictable.

But maybe Dark Knight Rises was supposed to be like that only and Nolan had too much to deal with in 2.5 hours. And maybe that's the main problem with DKR - too much is going on in the story that it seems crammed at times. And when there are too many characters and so many story arcs, it's tough to do justice to characters and story telling at the same time.

Dark Knight Rises have a good story but lacks strong characters and relies on Inception's style which incidentally differs from style of first two installments of Batman Trilogy.

And for me, soul of Nolan's Batman Series is its strong characters, their underlying emotions and a theme which is much deeper and meaningful than all fight, gadgetry and style. And this is where DKR fails.

6/10."
"Christopher Nolan has outdone himself with this one. At 3.30 in the morning, I was tired. Just getting out of it, I've never been so awake.

Perhaps what set this film apart from his other films was that it had a genuine emotional heartbeat. I felt that this was a flaw of Nolan's other films - the vision of emotion was there, but it was hollow. In this I bought it. I felt it, hero and villain alike.

Christian Bale was typically brilliant as Batman, and I felt that Bruce Wayne was more heavily embraced in this final installment. Bale added emotional depth to the character - a plot point that I think went astray in The Dark Knight - picking up from the development made in Batman Begins.

Tom Hardy as Bane was quite simply, terrifying. No longer a dunderhead ""enforcer"", but one of the criminal masterminds behind ""Gotham's Reckoning"", coupled with a physical dominance strong enough to send shivers down your spine.

Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle defied my expectations. Hands up who was not entirely convinced that that girl from the Princess Diaries could handle an intensely physical role like Catwoman. But here I am, hugely impressed. She added immeasurably to the value of the film.

Marion Cotillard fulfilled the role of Miranda Tate admirably, though I suspect this was the most underdeveloped character of the film - though after watching, I can see why.

The unsung hero of The Dark Knight Rises is Michael Caine as Alfred. A heartfelt performance that helps drive the emotional content of the film, helping Nolan sell his most well-rounded film to date. Caine's performance in both presence and absence.

Special mention goes to Joseph Gordon Levitt, who is consistently proving himself to be a big player in the Hollywood game. His role as officer Blake felt like there could've been more, but it may just have come all a bit much. It was a great performance, and Levitt sunk his teeth into role.

If you can, go see this in IMAX. If any film was to sell the format to skeptics, The Dark Knight Rises would be IT. I'm happy Nolan stuck to his guns and shot in 2D. 3D would have been unnecessary.

I suppose at this point, I have to turn my focus on Nolan. If he ever reads this... aspiring filmmaker to filmmaker, I've never been so envious, jealous in all my life. It's a film that leaves me floundering, wondering what I could possibly do to get anywhere near this ballpark. Well done. I think an Oscar Nomination is in order.

From here, I'm not sure what to expect of the future. Does our imagination carry us forward, or do the studios? Time will tell.

"I had the honor of watching TDKR during a screening and was completely blown away! Christopher Nolan's third film in his Batman trilogy doesn't disappoint. The movie is incredibly well made, its huge production is quite breathtaking to view. This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The movie's score high-lites many of its incredible scenes, and at times, it takes your breath away.

The film featured excellent performances, by all the cast. Christian Bale, as always is great as Batman. Anne Hathaway was completely engrossing, she became ""Catwoman"", just like Michele Pfeiffer did, although their interpretations were very different, both were equally effective. Tom Hardy was the main villain ""Bane"" completely shattered my expectations. One of the best superhero movie villains, I've ever seen. The terror caused by him, is completely believable and quite menacing. Marlion Cotilliard, Michael Cane, Gary Oldman, and others all did well in their respective roles. Now I know most will miss Heath Ledger as the Joker.(I know I do) I hope people don't compare Tom Hardy's performance to Heath Ledger's, its completely unfair and the two characters are very different. Just read the comics.

The colossal size of the film is a spectacle to behold, but surprisingly you don't get lost with all the explosions and extravagant action scenes, like in other films,(AKA Transformers, or POTC.) If one were to gripe, and I suppose there will never be a film made that one cannot find a point at which to grip, it is painfully long running time here. I found myself more worried about the pain in my posterior than the emotional final minutes after almost 3 hours that I had spent in a cramped seat, but that's just how I am. However the ending is just fantastic, so emotional and bring the trilogy to a very satisfying end.

Sorry if I'm being all fan-boyish and kissing this movie's behind, but I really admire it. It may not be among my personal favorites but generally this seems to be the movie event of this year. As a film though, this is amazing. A true lasting legacy in superhero story telling and summer-blockbusters."
"The best thing about this movie is how satisfying it is. It doesn't leave you frustrated or confused. You can't really complain that it didn't explore certain ideas or follow through. By deciding to have an official ending to this trilogy's story, the themes surrounding Batman are very fresh. We don't know where he'll end up. It's not the same old thing about whether he can continue to be Batman or not, which was already getting repetitive in Spider-man 2. The conclusions are not as important as the feelings they invoke as they come about. Nolan is especially good at capturing the complete tension of actually not knowing what will happen and deeply questioning what you *want* to happen and why.

This movie is bigger than the previous two, far more ambitious. There are no obvious annoying weaknesses that usually come with films in general, especially blockbuster action movies. All of Nolan's movies have deep psychological themes and this takes those in another new direction. I thought Inception was hugely original and insightful about the way people think. That level of abstraction and depth is present in this film. Bane bursts into it, his reputation is quickly established. Nolan uses people's expectations and anticipation to the fullest. We are left to wonder about what has happened in the 8 years since the events of The Dark Knight. Why have the characters become the way they are now?

In the latter half, it does seem like the movie is trying to pull off so many different plot points and connections, but they all work. The cast is very large and impressive. You don't see ""good acting"". You see fascinating characters. They're just playing their part in the grand story that's being crafted. There are many unfamiliar faces but they all have a strange, unique look to them. We often see a person's flaws and previous decisions coming back to haunt them. They find out the hard way what mistakes they have made. Where their limits are. Where they lose control.

The score is almost tribal, very raw and energetic. You don't get much chance to pay attention to it but many parts of the movie are pounding with excitement. There are countless quotable lines and disturbing slices of dialogue. They cut deep. The Joker was a great character and this is a very different movie but the themes are just as dark, only perhaps indirectly. Underneath, it's very sinister. Writing and efficiency appear to be among Nolan's greatest strengths. The story has many layers that interweave and apparently they came in under budget.

Perhaps the most important thing about Catwoman is that she's completely believable. When she beats up men, you don't roll your eyes. She's feminine and powerful in her own way. She fits into the world and we completely understand her motivations. She doesn't have a huge role but a very important one.

I didn't find myself moved but maybe I'm too cynical. I was more affected psychologically. Curious about humanity and all the different sides of it you see in this movie. It goes to many extremes. I felt humbled by my complete lack of life experience. What do I know about anything? How could I possibly understand half of the characters? I haven't been through anything or achieved anything compared to most of them. Michael Caine gets a bigger role this time. He was always critical but this time he's very much the emotional core.

I thought Christian Bale was overlooked in The Dark Knight especially. The movies hinge on him. Bruce Wayne's just a man but also incredibly inspirational. Bale's famous for completely committing to his roles and it pays off. Tom Hardy is impressive as Bane but I suppose that's no surprise. The rest of the leads are similarly awesome. There are many references to the earlier films. Very few questions are left unanswered. It's always nice when film-makers really think it through and make an actual decision and get all the details right.

So anyway, I'll miss Batman (since the trilogy has ended) but couldn't have hoped for a better, more epic and sincere finale to his story."
"The Batman series by Christopher Nolan was and is probably one of the best superhero series ever. In an industry where very few sequels have been that good, The Dark Knight, I believe was designed by Christopher Nolan to be head and shoulders above Batman Begins; and it was. The Dark Knight surpassed Batman Begins, end of story. Now that you have accomplished what very few have managed, how do you surpass this one. A daunting and mountainous task indeed. Only now, Nolan wasn't even trying to surpass it. He was merely trying to present a movie that would build on its predecessor.

The movie is set 8 years after the Joker incident so that anything related to the Joker need not be shown (RIP Heath Ledger). Nolan presents us a completely different Gotham. A different take on it. And how 8 years can change people. How the harvey dent and joker incident can affect people and batman himself. In a time of peace, it is quite easy to plan and attack even an entire city. Everything is taken into concern. And it all adds up to one seemingly invincible villain. The logic is never lost at any point of time. The screenplay is penned to allow the impact of what has happened to Gotham and its people in ""The Dark Knight"" and what could happen if something goes wrong now.

All things said, if you are expecting something better than The Dark Knight, you are mistaken. This was never going to compete or surpass that. This is a very good movie in its own right. As for the series, there cannot be a better conclusion and I really hope nobody else continues this series if Nolan decides not to.

TDKR needs to be appreciated for staying true to its roots and still giving us something good, exhilarating and unexpected."
"There are plenty of elements that made this film work, so I suppose we can tick them off one by one. For starters, the continuation on the focus of Bruce Wayne's story, which has made it all tick. This version of Bruce Wayne and Alfred become the familiar characters we're accustomed with since 2005, and the film invests heavily on the emotional bonding between the two, which deals back to the theme about fear that rears its ugly head again, and how a father figure cannot stand idly by to watch the one he brought up recklessly charge into battle after a long hiatus, and hoping for a life of normalcy with the mantle of the bat given up. Michael Caine may have a shorter screen time than before, but no less powerful.

When Sam Raimi had to put the popular and powerful Venom into Spider-man 3 pretty much against his wishes, we all knew how that turned out to be, effectively killing off the franchise until the decision to reboot it. There may be some similar fears with the introduction of a fairly contemporary villain in Bane, but the story gave him more purpose and meaning, and Tom Hardy was excellent par none in this role as the compete villain - with plenty of brawn, merciless, masterful, and with a plan any terrorist would be proud of. If the Scarecrow meant to induce fear, and the Joker to create chaos, Bane is carnage incarnate. Tom Hardy, even being the requisite mask, is fearful, and while the designs of his plan may dwarf the Joker's in complexity, it sure rivaled his in terms of delivery, and execution. Anyone in his path gets shoved aside with deadly consequences, and anyone alive is only because there is of further use. No hesitation, and no compromise.

And Nolan continues with the introduction of a lot more villains big and small, behind a mask or otherwise, in his Bat films than anyone would credit him for, especially when having those whose lines are blurred, or corrupt to the core and hiding behind social status and fortune. This in turn provides for another arc that boils underneath the main narrative, where the rich and powerful continue to enjoy their successes at the expense of the have-nots, and the Occupy Movement in a way being a very real parallel to the proceedings on screen. While the mobsters were clearly at the top of the food chain in the earlier Nolan films, this one shifted focus to politicians and the elite community, with their fair share of scandals and corporate greed.

While Bane was to the point, Selina Kyle played by Anne Hathaway, is both sensual and a force to be reckoned with herself, being like how she's best portrayed, on the fence. There's a bit of Frank Miller's Year One in this one given the presence of Juno Temple's Holly, and the back to basics as a jewel thief, compared to the mousy secretary in Tim Burton's Batman Returns with Michelle Pfeiffer defining the role, and the garbage that was Halle Berry's. Anne Hathaway nailed this one with what would be a truly memorable outing, and as if a homage of sorts to Burton's second Batman film, that the repartee between Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle at a party became one of the highlights here, as does her thievery and combat ability. She may lack her whip, but more than makes up for it with her steel stiletto heels, and the very sensual and sleekly designed feline moves that you'd wonder how they got delivered while wrapped under that skin tight suit.

And not only is the technology put on screen fictionally impressive, the technical aspects behind the scenes also worked wonders, chalking up serious mileage in having more than an hour's worth of footage shot on the IMAX format. Wally Pfister's cinematography continues to impress with that staying consistent to the gritty look and feel developed for all the Bat films to date, before his departure into a film director's role for his next project. Hans Zimmer also probably developed the best score for Nolan's Bat films, and I dare say without which this film would be less stellar, with the score playing a huge role in adding plenty of character and emotion to the film, lifting it up with excitement during the many set action pieces, with recognizable themes assigned to major players, heightening dangers, and providing a boost to the many feelings in this one heck of an action-adventure.

With how things developed at the end, and what I felt was initial horror of sorts with Batman out in broad daylight, secret identity being porous and all, this film ended in what would be the best way possible - with possibilities, and a twinkle of an eye, Inception style with a did it, or did it not. Twists, turns, surprises and sleight of hand, making it a clear favourite as one of the best this year. Do yourself a favour and watch it in the IMAX format, just as it was intended.

Because you have just got to believe in Christopher Nolan, and the kind of films he has so far delivered. Take a bow, bat-crew, for a trilogy that has now set the bar for any comic book film, and especially any other follow Batman movie, reboot or otherwise, to live up to."
"I'm going to start off by saying that this was probably one of my most anticipated movies of all time. I went in the theater hoping for a masterpiece. I actually expected this movie to jump into my top five of all time. It didn't disappoint, I loved it.

The opening scene had me questioning what exactly was going on. Movies that make you think about the smallest details of the plot are my favorite. In the scene the audience is introduced to the new villain, Bane. As a kid watching cartoons I always thought that bane was a mindless hulk-like bad guy. In this movie he has a true to the comic's portrayal. He's smart, he has a plan, and he'll stop at nothing to put it into action. Much like Dark Knight, the Villain is a major standout. He has such an intimidating presence on screen. Tom Hardy put so much work into the physicality of the character. The first fight between Bane and Batman is one of the moments that they had to get right. Luckily it's one of my favorite moments in the entire film! In the scene they don't use too much sound, just Bane's taunts as he fights, truly frightening. His voice is so interesting. It's something you'll really remember about the film. After the film my friends and I couldn't help but do Bane impressions. He has so many quotable lines that he will probably be one of my favorite villains of all time. You might be wondering if he outperformed the Joker from Dark Knight. The answer is no, not quite. He's so different of a character it's hard to compare, but Joker was just too hard to beat. Christian Bale's performance as Batman and Bruce Wayne was amazing. This was easily his best performance as Batman. The story takes place eight years after the end of Dark Knight so Bruce is feeling the ill effects of being batman. He uses a cane now, and he has a little grey hair. This is a story about Bruce Wayne coming back, and doing anything he can for his city. Bruce and Alfred have some amazing scenes where you forget your watching acting. The emotion they both convey when they're together is stunning. Michel Cane doesn't have as much screen time as he does in the other movies, but he's so good in the ones he's in you won't forget his performance. Morgan Freeman is back. He has some particularly funny scenes with Bruce. They feel like old friends yet again. You really can't go wrong with any of the actors in this movie. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays young police officer Blake. He has some great character development during the course of the movie. I was cheering for him the whole time. If you come out of this movie saying ""I just wish it had better acting"" I'd question your sanity. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman was one big worry I had about the movie going in. Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised. She did a great job of portraying the playful vigilante. She actually had okay chemistry with Christian Bale. Catwoman wasn't forced into the story, her character made sense within the plot. She didn't ruin the movie, which was all I was asking for. Plus, she actually looked like she could fight. She wasn't doing the ""I'm a woman who can beat up ten men with one hand tied behind my back"" routine. It was such a relief that they didn't try to do something annoying like Black Widow from Avengers.

The story was fantastic. It's amazing that Christopher Nolan wasn't planning on doing this movie before he made Batman Begins. There are so many callbacks and references to that movie I would strongly recommend watching that one again before you see this one. I kept saying ""Oh I remember when he said that!"" or thinking ""That ties in perfectly"". This one had plenty of twists and turns. Multiple times I was questioning what was true and what was a clever ruse. If there are any negatives, you might say there are some plot leaps. Not holes mind you, but something upon thinking about it you might consider a little unbelievable. With such huge story and scope I'm surprised there aren't more mistakes. The scale of this movie is far bigger than in either of the first two Batman movies. Bane has a plan for all of Gotham and batman has to stop an entire city of villains. The entire trilogy comes to a very fitting finish. I absolutely loved the ending. I was very satisfied how everything tied together. I especially loved the conclusion of Bruce's story, perfect. When I came out of the theater I couldn't wait to discuss the amazing things that happened in the end. This is a movie where the more you watch it the more you'll understand and enjoy it.

Of course, in the conclusion to a trilogy like this one you would expect to be dazzled by the special effects. They were quite impressive. The new batwing has some pretty amazing aerial maneuvers. You definitely get your money's worth with the cinematography. The opening and ending scenes especially stand out. There was an extremely cool Bat Pod driving scene that, as soon as it was over, I wanted to watch it again.

It can't tell you enough that this was an amazing movie. It was certainly the best of the year. If you're wondering if it's better than The Dark Knight I honestly can't say. Time will tell. It could be better, and that's some of the highest praise I can give it.

Edit: Time did tell. It didn't hold up. Still good. Nowhere near Dark Knight tkubas1.wordpress.com."
"'The Dark Knight Rises' is the third and final instalment in Christopher Nolan's groundbreaking trilogy that reshaped the superhero genre as we know it. The main cast return as well as some newcomers. Tom Hardy as 'Bane', Anne Hathaway as 'Selina', Joseph Gordon-Levitt as 'Blake' and Marion Cotillard as 'Miranda'. The new additions are fantastic, especially Tom Hardy. He brings a menacing presence to the character and finally incorporates the main part of his comic counterpart, his brains. For sure Bane is incredibly strong, but he is also an unbelievable strategist that can systematically wear down Batman whilst also using his strength to defeat him. Hardy displays all of this perfectly despite us barely seeing his face, the mask he wears makes him more frightening and is used as an interesting plot device later in the film. A lot of people criticised the voice that Hardy uses for this character, but personally I love it, I think adds to the mystery of the figure. The best acting comes from Michael Caine as 'Alfred Pennyworth'. Nolan really fleshes out Alfred and Bruce's relationship in this film and Caine plays the reluctant mentor figure perfectly. One of his final scenes really shows off his acting, the regret that Alfred pours out and it's heartbreaking. Whilst all of the other actors are great, Caine excels in this movie compared to 'Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight'. The writing is brilliant, so many twists and turns and a sensational ending that really brings the trilogy full circle and has a great ending to Bruce's arc. The dialogue is excellent, in particular the many Bane monologues that add another layer onto his great character. The fight choreography improves massively and is loads better than the last two films. Hanz Zimmers score is superb and works in all scenes that it features in. Also, the cinematography is beautiful, Wally Pfister, who has worked with Nolan throughout the trilogy, really peaks in this picture. However, this movie isn't perfect, Bane's final demise is very underwhelming, especially for a character that makes as much of an impact as he does. Finally the twist at the end with Blake feels tacked on and is inaccurate to the source material. Overall, I love this movie, for sure it doesn't live up to the heights of 'The Dark Knight' but it is still exceptional and was a stunning way to end this unbelievable series of films.

"Let me start by saying, that I am an avid Nolan admirer. Up until now I haven't seen a bad Nolan film. All of his movies would be in my top movies list if I had one, I consider him a genius. After seeing the final act of his Batman I have started to reconsider.

The movie was filled with moments where I found myself thinking ""This is not believable"" and after the first hour I asked myself ""Is this it?"". Gladly after the first hour things did become more meaningful. The ""fall"" of the dark knight was awesome, Bane was a tough guy and the Batman did suffer. It was great. Even Anne Hathaway came trough crushing all my negative preconceptions. Other than that, the movie certainly didn't deliver.

In the end they ruined Banes character. Batman's training in this film was far from believable. There were lot of little stories and story structures going on, which didn't work when added together. I mean they worked but comparing to the previous films of Nolan they certainly did not deliver. In many scenes I thought ""This is something that just could not happen"", the things in this film just didn't work. And I don't mean Batman doing his stunts, of course they are unrealistic, I mean all the little things that left me bothered.

On the other hand when it comes to Batman's stunts there were little, the end conclusion left me thinking ""was this the great finale of BATMAN?"". Isn't Batman supposed to do something cooler than fly a plane or ride a motorcycle? Isn't Batman supposed to be an acrobat who beats everyone in a cool, cunning and mysterious ways? Here he was the operator of an army plane. In the previous films he was Batman, in this film he doesn't really come off as Batman. His only a random commando wearing a Batman suit. This is something I could not forgive Nolan for.

If the scenes we're actually believable I would've propably considered forgiving him this error, but these two errors together are just too much for me to say this is an impressive movie. You might be able to go as far to say this is good, but it is not impressive. This is a shame, because the guy who did this has done nothing but impressive movies. For some other director this movie could be a good stepping stone for something better, an acceptable movie that did have its moments, but for Nolan it is an utter failure. There we're times in this movie when he got me and I was impressed. The movie did in certain scenes raise my emotion and hit me where it should've, but as a whole taking into account all the bad things it cannot be regarded as a movie above others.

I was let down with this movie. With all of his previous movies that I have seen in the theathre I have gone in with enormous expectations, like the kind of hyped mind you should never walk in with and every single time I have walked out with my expectations blown away by the grandness of what I have just seen. This time I walked in with the same expectations and came out disappointed. The only question in my mind being ""How was he able to not see these flaws in this movie, I thought he was a genius who could not fail""."
"This movie shows that despite failure, despite your fears, despite your enemies, you can be a hero. you can use all three of those things to your advantage and become something better than you were before you encountered them. it masterfully shows and tells that ANYONE can be a hero.

obviously on a technical level this film is perfect. almost the entirety of the third act is shot in beautiful imax, that's sadly only in 16:9 on 4K. just like with the previous transfers, sound and picture are great, but this is probably the best looking film to me.

it may not seem like it at first, but just like ra's and joker, bane is the opposite side of the same coin for batman. tom hardy perfectly embodies bane and the darkness, and obviously he's a downgrade from joker, but that doesn't mean he's not the perfect villain for a finale.

hans zimmer delivers probably my third favorite score from him, with an incredible theme for bane as well as many extensions of previous themes.

this is such an underrated finale. all three films mesh together so well, they feel like one. they mean so much to me, and i'll forever thank nolan for making these films."
"I've always loved superhero movies and as a kid Batman was my favourite superhero and I collected as many of the comic books as I could possibly afford.

Saying that I've never expected a superhero movie to be between the best genres of movies that I would ever watch. I just expect them to be entertaining and something fun to watch. I watch most of them; Superman, Spiderman, Ironman, X-men etc.

I expected the same this time but I was knocked off my feet. The actors, the storyline, the manuscript and the filming just came together as one of the best movies I've ever seen. This movie has really brilliant and powerful dialogues.

If you haven't seen it yet then I can strongly recommend it. I will definitely see it again with a good bottle of wine and popcorn. Enjoy!"
"Christopher Nolan's stunning conclusion to his Batman trilogy is a welcome return to form after the slightly overrated THE DARK KNIGHT, which was so obsessed with being all dark and brooding that it forgot to tell much of a story. Despite the presence of a much-hyped (and lamented) Heath Ledger in the cast, I found that film to be less entertaining than BATMAN BEGINS although it still remains an engaging and watchable film. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES (horrible title, by the way), though, blows it out of the water, offering a piece of sheer spectacle that's as involving and as tightly-plotted as you could wish for.

It's eight years since the last film, and Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne is nowadays retired and definitely feeling his age. Before long, though, a hulking brute of a bad guy (Tom Hardy, whose sheer physicality in the role will surprise nobody who's seen Bronson) decides to do some very unpleasant things in the city, so it's time to dust off the bat suit and get back into the action. Good news for the viewer.

As usual, Nolan surpasses the conventions of his genre, making this a superhero film that looks nothing like a superhero film, instead more like a modern-day epic of dramatic cinema. Yes, at the end of the day it's still about suited guys beating the hell out of each other, and Nolan once again relies on old conventions/clichés (such as the 'ticking bomb' trope, which he's repeated in his last three films now) to see him through, but everyone runs so well and so smoothly that you end up not minding.

The cast is thorough and involved as ever, Bale as usual going the extra mile to portray the tortured hero and Caine lending emotional support as Alfred. Hardy's villain is a sheer powerhouse who dominates every scene he's in, and Nolan brings back a couple of his favourites from INCEPTION (Marion Cotillard and Joseph Gordon-Levitt) for good measure. There's not quite as much action as you might expect from a film of this type, but the storyline is so involved that you don't care. Throw plenty of stunning special effects into the mix and you have a real crowd-pleaser of a film with real brain as well as brawn."
"Chris Nolan has r-e-a-l-l-y outdone himself again this time. An amazing story that I don't even know who else could write such a treatment on the World's Greatest Detective, the crowning glory of Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy.

I remember I once made a joke to myself a long while ago about him that if he was going to make another movie, he would probably cast Heath Ledger and Joseph Gordon-Levitt's respective love interests from a movie of which they BOTH starred in and worked on-- 10 Things I Hate About You.

It would be ironically funny how both actors are connected to each other from working at different times with the ""holy-moly mind-blowing"" filmmaker and that the actresses that played their love interests would possibly too as well."
"I'll be brutally honest here. I liked The Dark Knight better than this. Even though its just couple of hours since I finished watching it.

Sure, TDK had its flaws, but then, it was such a marvelous noir saga, a treatise in crime drama that left us begging for more at the end. The phrase ""page-turner"" is often applied to engrossing books, but that could work just as well for the magnificent film. To this day, I cannot take my eyes off whenever I see TDK and by the time that ravishing interrogation scene between Batman and Joker is on, nothing is likely to stir me from my seat. By choosing to make the titular character undergo a perception shift, a massive (and ultimately successful) gamble was taken. And who can forget the late, great Heath Ledger's spectacular performance?

TDKR is not a bad movie per se. Seen alone, it has the ideal ingredients for a summer blockbuster: an A-list cast, monumental action sequences, modern themes of terrorism and official ineptitude, as well as intricate sub-plots which mesh well together at the end. There is more than a passing reference to the predecessors, especially Batman Begins (which, in my humble opinion, is an enormously underrated flick). And it works to a great extent.

Where this film fails as TDK succeeded is in the amount of layering. Some sub-plots were so complex that I was left confused as to where I was before that particular sequence (case in point: Blake's impromptu reconnaissance of a dockyard). Others were left frustratingly hanging in thin air. The plot also seems slow paced at first. While the first sequence is downright awesome, what follows afterward is distinctly underwhelming. Above all else, Batman is renowned to be a master strategist. Here, he ends up getting deceived not once, but twice at Catwoman's hands. You mean to tell me that eight years is good enough to make a superbly trained, marine-worthy, genius escape artist-cum-detective become dull? Really?

I won't go ahead and slate Nolan more here, simply because he gave me the privilege of watching two of the best superhero movies ever filmed in Batman Begins and TDK. The glass is always half-full in my eyes, and I'll admit that Hathaway and Gordon-Levitt were both perfect selections for their roles. I'm not too sure of Tom Hardy, since his performance is more physical than metaphorical but given his task was to exude a ruthless menace, he did his job. The rest of the familiar supporting cast are brilliant as before, especially with Caine showing his human side that we always suspected was well alive beneath that stiff British upper lip exterior and dry wit. I read somewhere that this is not a Batman movie, but a Bruce Wayne movie. And I fully agree. Having to reconcile (with unflattering results) with a life without Batman, Bruce is alone even as a social presence and a corporate figure. It is a true challenge but then again, Christian Bale turned in a remarkable performance in both BB and TDK (he held his own in those scenes where Ledger was not present). And in TDKR, he leaves an indelible mark on a role that would probably be the benchmark.

Batman Begins was all about ""Fear"" while ""Chaos"" was a running theme in TDK. TDKR does a great job in being a conclusion to the trilogy, but it is not the best one among the three, probably because there is no strong undercurrent of a theme here."
"I am a huge fan of Christopher Nolan and the first 2 Dark Knight movies, so I had high expectations for this movie. The Dark Knight Rises is good, but it is nowhere near the level of the other two movies. It has several things that are a bit cliché and it also had several plot holes that I found very irritating and distracting. My friend who I saw it with initially thought it was the best out of the trilogy, but after we discussed the plot holes that he missed, he ranked it as the worst of the three movies. Throughout the movie I felt like everything was a bit overdone. It seemed like they were trying so hard to make the ""epic conclusion"" that they forgot to make it realistic or reasonable. One of the things I loved about the first two was how it dealt with Batman in a fairly realistic way. There was a fairly good overview of how he functioned and how he was viewed. In this I thought there was much less dealing with the separation of Bruce Wayne and Batman, which was one of the interesting parts of the first 2. Also, I would describe the main character of The Dark Knight Rises as Bruce Wayne rather than Batman, which I found greatly disappointing. Still a good movie, but not nearly as great as the first 2."
"-Minor Spoilers- First of all, why hate so much? The movie is not perfect, agreed. It's not the best movie ever, again agreed. However it's one of the best movies, and it's pretty damn good, even if it's not perfect. The plot is good, the action is good, cast is great, acting is great too, and the atmosphere the movie creates is fantastic! Ignore all the hate, and please go enjoy the film. And I don't understand, why are people comparing this movie to TDK? They're by the same director and they're part of the same trilogy, no comparison. TDK is too perfect, and we all know that. So why did ya all have your expectations sky high. Whenever a director releases a movie which is near-perfect, then it is hard for him/her to beat that movie. Sure he/she can make a movie equal to the other one, but to beat it, think again. Thus my expectations for TDKR were high, but not sky high. And guess what? It crossed my expectations, and it was really close to TDK. Tremendous film!

Lately I haven't developed an interest in comic book reading, and I really don't enjoy batman or to be honest I don't enjoy much of superhero films at all. Only a few. However I didn't only enjoy this movie as a superhero film, I also enjoyed it itself as a movie. The reason I don't watch many superhero films is because they're very tedious and repetitive, and there's no message. Here is how your everyday superhero film goes ""There is ""Whatever"" man. Some stupid person attempts to outsmart the _____man, and take over the city, and guess what? He fails, and ______ man gets respect for saving the city...the end"". TDKR was out of the ordinary. To be honest, the whole trilogy was ""Out of the box"" thinking, especially this and TDK. Both this and TDK made it to my Top 10 films of all-time, and many movies at this time don't even make it close.

The movie did have its problems as well, it was not perfect. One of the major concerns was the time. The movie had a near-3hr run time which was more than enough. There were some slow and boring parts at the beginning and middle of the film, but as the movie approached the ending, none of this really mattered. Also I didn't really like how Bane died. He was really bad-ass up until the end, where Catwoman whipped him out in 1 second. I was expecting another fight between Batman and Bane, only to find out something else? It was too fast of a death, and not only that, he was the villain of the film, how can you kill a villain in 1 second? And it was not even Batman who killed him, it was Catwoman? I personally wasn't expecting this at all.

-Major Spoilers- The movie really kept you glued to the screen near the end. I really liked the plot twists and never expected some of them. Though some were predictable, but others weren't, IMO. For example, Batman surviving, and Talia escaping from the prison rather than Bane was pretty unpredictable. On the other hand, John Black turning out to be Robin, and Miranda Tate turning out to be Talia al Ghul was more predictable. I think there were some more plot twists, but I can't really remember, because I saw the full movie once, and that was 3 months back.

At first I thought Bane was the one who escaped from the prison, and was the son of Henri Ducard, but it turned out that it was Talia, and Bane was just a friend. This was the real shocker for me. I didn't really care much for the other plot twists, but this really shook me hard. I never expected this, in fact I even forgot about this up until the end. Also batman surviving? This was the second most unpredictable twist. At first I thought just maybe he survived, but after the funeral, I was sure that he was dead. Then he appears in Florence? This was pretty shocking as well.

The second half of the film was the best, because that's when the excitement began. I was very curious about what was going to happen next. After the explosion scenes, the suspense began to rise rapidly. Then the climax came all together very nicely.

My favourite parts of the film in the first half were the opening ""Plane Hijack"" scene, the ""Stock Exchange"" scene, and ""Bane vs Batman"" fight 1. In the second half my favourite scenes were the ""Football explosion"" scene, ""Bane vs Batman"" fight 2, and the final chase scene. Some of the other fight scenes involving Catwoman and Robin were pretty good too.

Final thoughts, I didn't expect much of this movie after TDK. TDK was perfect, and I thought this movie would be no where close, but it was pretty damn close. It was really good too. The action was great. The cast, acting, and dialogue were all fantastic. Especially the dialogue between Alfred and Bruce. Gary Oldman did a great job, not to mention that Joseph Gordon-Levitt did an amazing job as well. Tom Hardy turned out to be a great villain. Even though Bane's voice was kind of confusing, but it was pretty cool. Overall the whole movie includes some great action scenes, and runs a full circle completing TDK legend in an Epic way!

Final Rating 9/10."
"Christopher Nolan has out done himself again, striking not just Batman fans, but fans of the series and movie goers everywhere with his beautifully crafted, last installment of The Dark Knight trilogy, The Dark Knight Rises. The acting has always been well done in the last two, but something about the last one really made me feel the performances were real, quite like the late Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker. The movie ran about two hours and forty-five minutes give or take, but I never wanted it to end. The story progression never seemed to drag on, the movie always kept me on the edge of my seat. This is one that will be an all time favorite of mine, and a true classic.

"I can't express in words of how amazing this movie is. All I have to say is go watch it for yourself.the is really the best,don't get me wrong i enjoyed the others but this one truly takes the cake!I said before batman begins is the best film i had ever seen without any exception. However viewing the 2005 Christopher Nolan production, I was pleasantly shocked. Then after my huge expectations for, ""The Dark Knight"", Christopher Nolan blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, ""The Dark Knight Rises""? Quite simply, Yes! My big expectations were once again, blown away. What a production! This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The editing, sound, score, visuals, direction and action are all top notch.I am wholly satisfied with Christopher Nolan's vision and thank all who worked on this film for bringing such an intricate interpretation of its very famous literary source.a big kiss for Christian Bale and Anne Hathaway i really love them.if i visit USA this will be for visit Christian Bale and Anne Hathaway. thanks for all."
"Christopher Nolan was assigned with the job of coming out with a new Batman movie comparable to The Dark Knight. Did he succeed? In short, yes. Is it better than The Dark Knight? No. But is it incredible, awesome, and everything we could have hoped for? Yes. This movie would be the best Batman movie and even one of the best movies ever if Heath Ledger wouldn't have put on the face paint. That's what I think is the biggest difference between the movies. While Tom Hardy's Bane is very very well done and flat out frightening at times, nobody can top Ledger's Joker. But don't think for a second that TDKR is any worse because of that.

The Dark Knight Rises brings the biggest threat of all three movies to Gotham in the form of Bane. Bane is Batman's biggest threat he's ever had physically and forces Bruce Wayne to return as Batman after entering an isolated state. Much less happens in this movie than in the previous two and I think it's because of the villains. In Batman Begins, Batman had to fight the Mob, Scarecrow, and Ras Al Ghul. In The Dark Knight, Batman had to fight the Mob, The Joker, and Two-Face. In The Dark Knight Rises, Batman has to fight Bane, and only Bane. From beginning to end, all Batman has to do is figure out how to defeat Bane and stop him from finishing his evil plot. While Batman Begins is some what lessened in genius because it has to tell the origin story of Batman, and The Dark Knight is just obviously amazing to everyone who sees it, The Dark Knight Rises has more of a hidden genius. Most people will miss all the symbols and why this movie is so brilliant and such a masterful ending to the Dark Knight's Legacy.

There's so much I wish I can say, but I don't want to spoil it for you. All I should say is see it. See it and be amazed by it. 10 Stars out of 10."
Gotham's reckoning.Well TDKR the last installment of the Nolan's Batman series ended in the perfect note the way trilogies are a supposed to end the real trilogy. So whats so great about this movie? This movie has it own moments when you get the chills on several occasions about whats is going to happen next it is almost breathtaking.Brilliant performances by all the actors in the movie.Hans Zimmer did it again by making the perfect score for the movie which will glue you to the seat and a wonderful plot which brings justice to the entire series. But but there is a but there are a few things which i felt should have been how it was which I am not going to mention because this needs to be a spoiler free review and i want it to be but this movie is worth every penny. Is this movie better than The Dark Knight? Well to that I have to think about it I cant sum up to the conclusion yet but again for me Batman Begins revolves around Batman The Dark Knight about the people of Gotham TDKR well why are you still reading this go watch it for yourself as i said it was worth every dime ...
"As a huge fan of superhero movies and undeniably the batman Christopher Nolan has depicted is the favourite of my choice. He is humane yet enigmatic, heroic and self-giving. Chris Nolan has produced superhero movies into a whole different level. The action, acting, sound and other visual effects was absolutely mind-blowing for the previous two productions. He is good at picking the right cast playing the right role like Michael Caine, Gary Oldham and Morgan Freeman who have always been the linchpin behind the success of the movie. I am also in awe of his previous works excluding the batman series such as Momento and The Prestige. So I had high hope and expectation on the Dark Knight Rises of how the director can build up the finale of the Batman trilogy which the world has long anticipated this blockbuster.

Judged by the content of the trailers, lots of people might expect it to be an action intensive film with lots of explosive elements and the elemental conflict between good and evil. If I'm honest, I have already seen most of the action scenes of the movie via the trailers before watching the film which is a saddening thing to hear from an audience's point of view. The entire film was almost three hours long and there were way too much chit chatting with the whole conspiracy by the villain but not getting down into the main point or the action bits. I think those scenes about having trials on the people by the judge whether they were guilty or not was plainly farcical in my opinion and quite cheesy which I never experienced in the previous two batman films.

The Dark Knight Rises has put in a lot of new characters who played a key role in the film including Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing John Blake and Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate. But the main villain, Bane played by Tom Hardy made me anticipated on how he can use his eyes as his weapon to proceed the acting, to show his wrath towards the corrupted society. I must say I was a bit disappointed at the villain role as the joker simply played too well in The Dark Knight in which Tom Hardy could not exceed the expectation. With those prestigious casts which all of them are great actors, I expected that it would be a sensational experience crafted by those actors. However, the entire film always talking about bits and bobs and never really get to one main theme. The experience was messy and too stuffed in without much focus to cause the audience to fall into the frictional world that Christopher Nolan was trying to present.

In conclusion, The Dark Knight Rises does not exceed my expectation nor better than the predecessor. I thought it was a let down the way how Christopher Nolan wrap up this impeccable Batman series. I only gave the rating 7/10 because of the two fantastic previous productions he made."
"The Dark Knight Rises (2012) The crusader in the mask For the last few years cinematography and special effects took a big step in improving the quality of their own products. That's why every new film set the bar higher and higher, therefor competition is rising. However, this is what exactly people want. Today once again saw this movie and decided to share my point of view, because while it is almost 3 years old, nevertheless with every time watching this film is no less mesmerizing.

In my opinion the plot of the third part surpassed even the second with loved by all great Heath Ledger as the Joker. It is very interesting and confusing, and if the beginning of the film (as is a rule in the case with Cristofer Nolan) is pretty tight, by the end of it is already impossible to put down. Eight years after the events of the previous part Gotham lives in piece and silence. Police Commissioner James Gordon feels guilty about covering up Harvey Dant's crimes and Dark Knight's disappearing because of that. However, events occurring in the city for the last days cry for help the hero, as well as the beauty who has got into trouble – Cat Woman. So Batman dares to speak out against the main villain – Bane. Christopher Nolan - a man who showed how the movie can be removed on comics. Already, it makes him one of the best producers nowadays. As he said, for the first Batman movie the main theme was ""fear"", for the second - ""chaos"", for the last - ""pain"". This pain is more soulful and Bruce Wayne will feel it completely.

Christian Bale – a man always on his top. For the late 80's and 90's kids he will always be the Dark Knight. Christian Bale is my Batman. He is my hero.

Anne Hathaway - a perfect Cat Woman. She is my favorite actress and she didn't disappoint me. It costs a lot. Joseph Gordon-Levitt played the role of energetic young cop - Blake. It seems this guy have a bright future, because Joseph is showing cool actor's skills. Morgan Freeman,

Gary Oldman and Michael Caine showed that ""old"" doesn't mean ""bad"". An incredible full compliance with the allotted roles. Soundtrack. «Basara Deshi» permeates the entire history by becoming the theme both for Bane and Batman.

I can say with certainty that the film was a success. Nice plot and amazing special effects because of the big budget are doing their job. Strong main villain who are all the time winning good guys causes the audience worry and fear. However, like rays are trying to break through the clouds, good is trying to break through. All this and beautiful Anne Hathaway don't give the audience to look away from the screen. Many of the best characters in the Batman universe, as if in a mirror, reflect the character of the protagonist, or when walking on the razor's edge between justice and revenge, or when caught in a trap of injuries in the past. Loyal fans of comics hardly surprised many plot twists, which is quite natural if we remember how the story developed in detail. For truly impressive how Nolan and his co-authors-screenwriter David S. Goyer and Jonathan Nolan managed to finish the trilogy of Batman. The film seems to be more emotional than the second part with it's psychological games. Of course, it has a lot of drama and even tragedy as well, but ""Dark Knight Rises"" touches the most. This large-scale painting, remaining harmonious, with great music and very beautiful camera work. However, the scope and action, going beyond imagination, leads to the fact that the scene, each of which is costs more than the budget of any other film, are perceived as ordinary events, while Bruce Wayne looks better in private moments, whether it's the episode where one of the characters finally realizes who is actually a man- bat, or the scene with the advent of a new character. Also there is a problem with the female audience understanding the reality of the plot, because there a lot of moments related to the previous parts. For example, such an important character of the first part and Batman story as Ras'el'Gul, whose name was named in a few episodes of the movie. Everyone should see this picture, are you a child or adult, it does not matter whether you love comics knight in black armor or you don't. Everyone who will leave the cinema will be inspired by something. Your brain processes speed up and you will feel strong and ready for new challenges. No matter where you are, who you are, when you are. What is important is that the message is delivered to you and it's your business what to do with it. Nolan and Co. did what they wanted to do. Created a symbol. Created a hero. My hero.

Score: 10 out of 10 Batmans"
"A feline fingerer has taken to your pearls, although identity's the intent of this girl, as she initiates engagement, allows the stirring of assuagement, the final chapter is prepared, starts to unfurl. A villain name of Bane brings down an empire, an exchange leads to a tomb, so deep and dire, a saviour's weaponised, the population terrorised, Ra's al Ghul's destructive end, is the desire. But there are those who can align and form resistance, as you recover your resolve and your persistence, as the endgame twists and turns, a web of intrigue is discerned, and you race to save the day and create distance."
"There's a common misconception when it comes to The Dark Knight Rises especially regarding how it tackles it's themes and story: this film isn't trying to raise the stakes, it's trying to add to the story, in this case his loneliness, his sense of powerlessness.

Hans Zimmer's score is some of the best I've ever heard, Wally Pfister peaked, had the best choreographed action scenes out of the whole trilogy, had the most emotionally resonant story out of the trilogy for sure. A very well made and satisfying conclusion that makes this trilogy one of the best .. ever?

A perfect comic book movie, certainly one of my favourites of all time"
"Christopher Nolan's *The Dark Knight Rises* serves as a powerful conclusion to his acclaimed Batman trilogy, delivering a breathtaking blend of action, emotion, and thematic depth that elevates the superhero genre. Set eight years after the events of *The Dark Knight*, Gotham City is in a state of uneasy peace, and Bruce Wayne, portrayed masterfully by Christian Bale, is a shadow of his former self. The film adeptly explores themes of redemption, resilience, and sacrifice, leaving viewers contemplating the complexities of heroism.

Nolan's direction is impeccable, capturing the grandeur and scale of Gotham in its darkest hour. The cinematography is striking, with sweeping shots that enhance the film's epic scope. The supporting cast, including Tom Hardy as the formidable Bane and Anne Hathaway as the enigmatic Selina Kyle, add depth and intrigue to the narrative. Hardy's portrayal of Bane is particularly noteworthy, bringing a physicality and menace that challenges Batman in unexpected ways.

The film's pacing is engaging, interspersing intense action sequences with moments of quiet reflection, allowing the audience to connect with the characters' struggles. The score, once again composed by Hans Zimmer, elevates the experience, underscoring the emotional stakes of the story.

Overall, *The Dark Knight Rises* is a triumphant conclusion that brings closure to Bruce Wayne's journey. It masterfully balances thrilling action with profound character development, solidifying its place as a modern cinematic classic. Fans of the genre and newcomers alike will find themselves captivated by this ambitious and emotionally charged finale."
"The tone of The Dark Knight Rises is set from the very first scene, when we are introduced to Bane (Tom Hardy) who crashes a plane that he himself is a passenger to. This is the first time we see the brute strength that he possesses. He is insanely strong through the use of the chemical ""venom"" which is pumped into him through his mask. As we leap into the rest of the story we see right away that director, Christopher Nolan, wasted no time in picking up right where he left off in The Dark Knight, with the death of Harvey Dent, and Batman being the criminal. This film was one of the big blockbusters in summer 2012, and for good reason. This movie brings the classic Batman comic book characters to life, which is evident in the acting, the sets, the script, the plot, and as many know, the dramatic ending. The acting is so well done, as we see emotion poured into each roll. Christian Bale (Bruce Wayne) Michael Cane (Alfred Pennyworth), Tom Hardy (Bane), and Anne Hathaway (Selena Kyle) all dove head first into their roles, leaving nothing behind. They each play a convincing role, identical to the characters that are portrayed in the Batman comics. One of the best examples is the relationship between Batman and Catwoman, because Batman is just, and Catwoman is a thief, but they are romantically involved with each other. The sets of this movie are stunning. Bruce Wayne's mansion and Batcave are just as they are depicted in the original comics. They are all encompassing and eye candy to any Batman lover. As we look back to the 1990's, we see a Batman comic book story arc that is very similar to the plot of TDKR. But Nolan's twist on the storyline is a refreshing change. Some may disagree, but not knowing what is coming next is part of the joy that comes with this film. Nolan keeps some of the key reference points in his film, but adds his own interesting, and modern additions to the film. Take for example, Bane's appearance. In the comics, Bane was unrealistically strong, and in the film he is much more realistically depicted. The only complaint I have with this film is, if Bane is so strong, why does he cover up his muscles with a vest or a coat for the majority of the movie? Show off your strength, be proud! The plot is the main focus point, like it should be. If explosions and fighting is all you want to see, then go see Pacific Rim. I'll say sorry in advance if you have wasted your time with that movie. Getting back on track to the plot, which might take a couple of watch throughs to fully catch all of the detail in this storyline. Throughout this movie, the focus is not on Batman, as one would expect, but on Gotham City itself. Bane brings the city to hell and back, and Batman is sitting on the side lines, bruised and battered, left watching, waiting, and hoping that his beloved city isn't left shattered and destroyed. The script of TDKR was written with pure precision, which allows us, as an audience, to remember key points of the movie through the use of dramatic quotes. Bane has a lot of one-liners that leave you repeating them to your friends after you see the film. Here are a few examples of memorable Bane quotes; ""But you merely adopted the dark; I was born in it, molded by it."" ""when it is done and Gotham is ashes, then you have my permission to die."" Because of Bane's voice, these short, memorable lines only add to the effect Nolan was going for. Leaving you on the edge of your seat wondering how Batman could possibly win? The moment you doubt if the good guy can win, that's when you know the director has succeeded.

This was a very well done film, and I encourage you to see it several times (it might take a few times to fully grasp the story) and the way this film ends is the perfect way to close out the series. In the end it all comes down to autopilot, back stabbing, and a turn of events by a woman you would not expect, all ending in an unpredictable manner."
The Dark Knight Rises is one of the most intense super hero movies I have watched. The opening scene is intense as the bad guys swing into action to get the good guys as the plane is moving into a tail spin. This time the world is void of the Bat crusader as he is in mourning the loss of his beloved. The plot lines are mix as you feel at times you need a chart to know who the good and bad guy is. The thread though out the movie is dark and deep and the most dramatic character is the bad guy Bane appears to take over the city of Gotham. A long movie that will keep you in total suspense until the end of the run. This movies does a good job of bringing into the mix several story lines from the comic book series. bravo!
"as much as i am huge fan of the batman in almost every facet of the genre, i am having a hard time getting completely behind this film. it makes the same mistake a lot of sequels do: it tries to pack too much into the story. the reason why the first two films in the trilogy, batman begins and the dark knight, worked so well was because they mostly focused on one central story and villain. in the dark knight rises there are too many new characters and too many story lines to be introduced and told that the film loses focus. sure it has plenty of action which you would expect but nolan strays too far from the source material when it comes to the characters in the film. the cast does a fine job with the script they had to work with and most film goers will probably like this film but i think true fans of the batman who know the history of the characters will wonder what nolan is doing to their batman."
"What is up with all this haters? Seriously, it makes me want to laugh because they're so ignorant. Some people here are saying: ""Worst Batman film ever"", or: ""I prefer watching Adam West Batman than this mess."" Wow, just wow. Anyways, enough complaining, this is one of the greatest conclusions in film trilogies history. No worry, this is a spoiler free review. The film is almost 3 hours long and the impressive thing is, the movie is NEVER dull, it's always keeping you interested because if its smart dialog and action. The story is great too. Bruce Wayne has stopped fighting crime as the Batman for 8 years after the Joker wanted to terrorize Gotham. But now a new threat has arrived, Bane. His plan is to burn Gotham to ashes and the Batman is the only one who can stop him.

Now the cast in this movie is really good. Christian Bale is a great Batman as always. Michael Caine deserves an Oscar nomination as best Supporting character for his amazing performance as Alfred Pennyworth. Anne Hathaway really impressed me as Catwoman. She steals any scene she's in. Tom Hardy as Bane is a great villain in this film. My favorite villain since the Joker. Joseph Gordon Levitt as John Blake delivers a good performance as well. Also Morgan Freeman and Marion Cottillard were good as well.

I love Trilogies, this trilogy is in my top 5 and ranks #2 right behind The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. In conclusion this is an amazing trilogy, the best of superheroes films and the second best trilogy of all time. All I have to say is, thank you Mr. Nolan, thank you. 10/10."
"This film is spectacular, the closest thing I have seen to perfection in film since the good ol days of filmmaking.

If you're hoping its better than The Dark Knight, your hopes have been answered. Christopher Nolan somehow outdoes himself once again, delivering a fantastic plot with great action, character development, and direction.

The writing itself is a wonder. The dialogue in this film is outstanding and perfectly fits each character.

Heath Ledger set a new standard for acting talent in comic book films. TDKR definitely meets that bar, possibly surpassing it. No single performance is better than Ledger's but everyone gives 110% in this and it comes together nicely. Christian Bale gives perhaps his most heartfelt performance in this one, and Tom Hardy is terrifying as Bane. Other regulars such as Caine and Oldman are just as good as ever. Joseph Gordon Levitt is a breath of fresh air and plays his part to perfection. However, I give it to Anne Hathaway for stealing the show. She is seductive, sexy, and dangerous as Catwoman, and becomes the very essence of the femme fatale.

Hans Zimmer continues to be my favorite film composer. His score simply blows me away, especially the way he uses the chants from the trailers as Bane's theme. Zimmer promised us an epic score, and delivered.

Editor Lee Smith and Director of Photography Wally Pfister both continue their win streak, as well as production designer Nathan Crowley and Costume designer Lindy Hemming.

All in all, TDKR is the best of this series. It is emotionally gripping and, at times, gutwrenching. As a current film student, I can honestly say that TDKR possesses all of the essential qualities of an Oscar for Best Picture. If you have seen the previous two Batman movies, you will enjoy this film so much more than you ever have. It truly is a whole new cinematic experience."
"So after seeing the The Dark Knight my expectations were pretty high for this movie and most movies would fail miserably but luckily The Dark Knight Rises is not one of most movies. It absolutely lived up to my expectations. What was good about the movie? Pretty much everything. The acting was top notch in this movie everyone does a good job in it. The action was great but the movie is great without action. Tom Hardy as Bane is one of the most terrifying villains I have ever seen. I likes the characters, the story everything. The one gripe that people might have is that it is very dark. But even that is not a real issue. In the end I loved this movie I recommend it to everyone an even though its not as good as The Dark Knight its still an amazing movie."
"Right from the start of the movie you will be on the edge of your seat. Personally I think this is the best conclusion I have ever seen. Performance of each actor in the movie is outstanding.Before I saw the movie I thought that Anne Hathaway wouldn't be as good cat-woman as Michelle Pfeiffer was, but not only was she better, she blew Michelle away. All the special effects are amazing and unbelievable. I have to say I love some of the batman's new toys. I have seen it in V Max theater last night but I am going to see it again in I MAX because Its worth the experience. It runs for 2 hours and 45 minutes but it felt like 30 minutes and I wanted more. 10 stars is not enough for such a great movie. I recommend to all movie lovers out there to go and see it in cinemas."
"what can i say really, this movie is fantastic. the plot is genius. the actors and so well put together. the best movie of 2012!

The direction they took this movie is beautiful. and the way ended the trilogy is breathtaking.

This is the best batman movie. his biggest job yet!

Save gotham one last time! the rise sequence is perfect. Lovie it!

10/10 all the way.

nolan the way.....

Nolan is amazing! :)

Also, Bane is great. Now i like joker and bane both. i like them eqaul. The joker scared me but yet i rooted for him. Bane really freaked me out! Scary stuff!"
"The Dark Knight Rises and Falls. I cannot put it in more simpler words than that.

I went in there with my coffers full of hope of having my mind blown out. After all it was Christopher Nolan and I am yet to see a work of his which has under-delivered.

But I guess everything has a first time.

Don't get me wrong. It's a good movie, not just a great one, and it left me highly confused as to how I should feel about it. TDKR, more than anything, falls under its own weight. With the endless hype and as a follow up to one of the greatest superhero movies of all time, TDKR had a lot riding on its shoulders. Tasked with this,Christopher Nolan has to be lauded for what he has achieved, or should I rather say 'hoped to'?

Let's begin with the basics. The Dark Knight trilogy was not a trilogy to begin with. Batman Begins (BB) and The Dark Knight (TDK) are almost two independent Batman films with little in common in terms of a story arc other than the characters it carries forward. That given, TDKR's greatest flaw was in attempting to connect the first movie to his final one so as to make it feel like one continuous arc. (Think kind of what happened in the final season of LOST) While I understand Nolan's intentions, the forced continuity just killed it.

This was further amplified by the many plot holes that marred the story. To keep this review spoiler free I will not mention any of them here but it will suffice to say that if you are a fan of the series but are willing to look past your fanboy goggles, the failings are plain to see.

Tom Hardy's take on the superstrong Bane was interesting enough to start off with, but as it went on there were just too many similarities with a previous villain (I will not say which one) to actually stand out on his own. Even his motives and methods were too familiar to be regarded as novel. His fights with Batman were epic enough though, and you almost pity Batman for having to face the mini-hulk that Hardy had transformed himself into. His menacing voice coupled with the cold hard stare in his eyes gave him the aura of a truly awful foe, one that must not be triffled with.

But add to that some cringe worthy dialogues, forgetful action sequences and appalling acting by Marion Cotillard, and I find myself subtracting more from the movie than adding. Nolan needed to make this movie bigger and better than the previous two, and for that he needed a crisis large enough to destroy Batman's world. While he did manage to conjur up a scheme, its immensity and implausibility made it hard to believe. I really wanted to love this movie but far too often found myself shaking my head in dismay as things got grander and larger, until they no more fit into the world.

But while I might seem to be cursing the movie a lot, remember I did say it is a good movie. And the best thing for me in the movie was - wait for it - Anne Hathaway as Catwoman/Selina Kyle.

I will confess that when I had first heard the casting I was more than dismayed. But now I'm forced to eat my own words. Anne Hathaway was brilliant. She might not be your regular comic book version of Selina Kyle, but in Nolan's Dark Knight universe she was the perfect choice to portray Gotham's sexiest vigilante. Everything from her stance to her fight moves and to the way she spouted sassy dialogues was perfect. Given more time and space, I am sure she could have probably stolen the show.

That however would have been unfair to Christian Bale/Bruce Wayne/Batman. The man has been a constant shining light throughout the series. He is a perfect fit for the role and has carried both versions of his character almost flawlessly. Moving into his third (and final) film in the series, I am glad to say he has not faltered a bit. While BB was about Batman, and TDK about the Joker, this movie was about Bruce Wayne the man behind the mask. As a superhero who is a mere mortal compared to most others out there, TDKR's focus on Bruce Wayne's mortality was totally warranted. This was not a Batman movie. This was a Bruce Wayne movie, with his alter ego guest starring. TDKR plays out like the swansong it is to this great character Bale and Nolan have moulded over the years.

Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine are as dependable as usual. They provided stellar performances as always. Even the newcomer to series - Joseph Gordon-Levitt gave a fine performance as the hotheaded cop John Blake. His character was by far one of the most interesting in the movie, developing into interesting dimensions, but alas finally being let down partly by the story and mostly by the limited run time that a movie of this scope can afford to a new character.

All in all, TDKR is a fine movie, but sadly nothing more. While I thoroughly enjoyed the ending (the last 5-10 minutes) and a bunch of scenes here and there, the action sequenced seemed bland, and the motives for some of the main characters left a lot to be desired. Batman was great as usual, but Bruce Wayne was better. And given the track-record of threequels, TDKR is a comparatively great ending to a great series, even if it is not all that it could have been. Probably the weakest entry to the series but nonetheless a wholesome entertainer on its own merits. Just don't expect to be blown away."
"I am not a critic but an average movie goer , but I must say that this movie is a pale shadow of the previous movie .

Missing the usual quality of a Chris Nolan movie . The movie lacks the frenetic pace of the previous title .First half of the movie is painfully slow . Second half picks up pace but still no big fireworks. Anne Hathaway unexpectedly performed very well in her role .

Weak story line .Background score average .Villain is simply lame with a dog mask ,and is nowhere near the calibre of Joker.No great twists or surprise in the plot ,lacks suspense .

Overall a better than average movie .Take my advice watch it at home ."
"The Dark Knight Rises is a brilliant,excellent and masterful epic conclusion to The Dark Knight Trilogy. Filled with excellent direction,wonderful performances,great Action and epic storytelling,The Dark Knight Rises is Christopher Nolan at his best.

Set eight years after the events in The Dark Knight,Batman/Bruce Wayne(Christian Bale) has been a recluse and retired as Batman and Gotham City has been at peace as well as safe and quiet. But when a new threat and terrorist named Bane(Tom Hardy)comes into Gotham City and threatens to destroy and demolish Gotham,Batman must come out of retirement to fight and face Bane and save the city of Gotham from destruction.

The Dark Knight Rises is a powerful and unforgettable conclusion to The Dark Knight Trilogy,it is a film that loved since I saw it in theaters and I cannot understand why the film has gotten a mixed to negative reception with most Batman fans. I guess because this film came out after Nolan's other films The Dark Knight and Inception which raised the bar really high when it comes to filmmaking and were universally loved by everyone and comparing this film with the other two this film can be seen as letdown for most people but not to me. The Dark Knight Rises is an Epic in the truest since of the word because Nolan has created a film that is big not only in length(2 Hours and 45 minutes)but in scope as well bringing everything to higher level whether it's the Action or the storyline. The film was so epic it probably would be longer with an overture like the epics of the 50s and 60s. Most of the time the third film in the trilogy is usually seen as the weakest but Nolan is a smart filmmaker who knows that if you are going to complete a trilogy you have to go out with a huge bang and TDKR goes out with not only a bang but with explosions. What I love about TDK Trilogy is that while all of them are three connected films all them are different in story. If Batman Begins is an origin story and Action/Adventure and The Dark Knight is a Crime Drama then TDKR can be described as a War Film. TDKR is War Film in sense where there are armies rising and gangs are controlling the streets with power,guns and tanks and Gotham is divided like a Civil War between the rich and poor or cops and criminals. With the theme of War and control running throughout the film you pulled into a Dystopian nightmare where Gotham City is being held hostage and not the cops or government can do anything about it and the only person that can do anything about is Batman. In TDKR we see not only the physical but also the mental toll being Batman has had on Bruce Wayne. Bruce has become broken down and a recluse and the damage of being Batman has affected his friendships and relationships or lack there of. Bane is such a great villain because where The Joker in TDK wanted to make people evil and corrupt and wanted to burn Gotham,Bane wants the people of Gotham to take control and take back the city of Gotham from the corrupt and the rich and create a revolution and army and still wants to destroy Gotham City. Bane is villain unlike Batman has ever faced before because Bane can match Batman on no only a physical level but on an intelligence level as well. The Action scenes in the film are amazing and like the first two films are done in a realistic way. Each Action scene is handled with a great deal of suspense and build up and this time it is done on an big scale to match the epic feel of the film. When the Action in the film happens you are glued to the screen and mesmerized. The ending of the film lasts about 20-30 minutes and it will blow you away with it's filmmaking and craft. The ending will have you cheering and smiling and it is a great conclusion to this film and The Dark Knight Trilogy.

The cast does an excellent jobs in their roles. Christian Bale is excellent in his final performance as Batman/Bruce Wayne bringing the same depth and intensity to the role. Tom Hardy is simply brilliant and scary as Bane,with using his voice,eyes and body language for the performance. Hardy's performance in my opinion makes Bane one of the best villains in film history. Gary Oldman is great once again as Jim Gordan,with Oldman bringing cynicism and depth to the role. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is fantastic as Blake,an idealistic rookie cop. Anne Hathaway is wonderful and sexy as Catwoman/Selina Kyle and has great scenes with Bale. Marion Cotillard does a great job as Miranda,Bruce's other love interest. Morgan Freeman excels once again as Lucius Fox,Batman's weapon maker. Michael Caine is amazing once again as Alfred. Caine's final scenes with Bale are powerful and well-acted. Matthew Modine(Foley)and Ben Mendelsohn(Daggett)give good performances as well.

The direction by Christopher Nolan is excellent and brilliant,with Nolan always moving the camera and having great shots and camera angles and giving the film an epic feel and Nolan does a great job with the Action scenes. Great direction by Nolan.

The score by Hans Zimmer is brilliant and intense and matches the dark and epic tone of the film. A great memorable score by Zimmer.

In final word,if you love Batman,Christopher Nolan,Comic Book films,Superhero films or films in general,I highly suggest you see The Dark Knight Rises,a brilliant,masterful and epic conclusion to an excellent trilogy that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10."

Character: Obviously Christian Bale and Tom Hardy.

Overall, I like it. It is really enjoyable and entertaining. Of course you'd want to see it again and again."
"I don't know where to start,. The power source shown in movie caught my eye;its very nice of Nolan to show the very future power source without loss of reality.

The action scenes between Wayne and Bane are so dramatic that when Batman hits Bane it clearly portrays that it was more out of confidence and will to fight against evil rather than strength and muscle whereas it appears opposite in case of Bane hitting Batman.The Catwoman's action scenes couldn't have been better the attitude,spontaneous performance,flexibility in physique are perfectly played by Anne Hathaway.

Hans Zimmer's music is an extra ordinary asset to the film .the back scroll in every action sequence is so wonderful to bring up goose bumps all-over.Especially the chant 'deh-shay bas-ha bas-ha' is clouded with drum beat and would take you into the depths of morality in the movie.

After a movie like 'The Dark Knight' its the very guts of Nolan to continue that should be appreciated.he must be a very good social visionary to write-up such an excellent ending to the trilogy.I don't need to separately chant praises on his direction and screenplay.And the twists in movie surprises everyone."
"With a gargantuan ambition, huge stakes, powerful themes, compelling characters and a fantastic third act, The Dark Knight Rises exceeded my already sky high expectations, and delivered an extremely satisfying conclusion to the trilogy."
"Words cannot adequately describe how awesome this movie is! It is everything you thought it would be and much more. Most certainly a beautifully crafted psychological crime thriller and a truly satisfying conclusion that does justice to the trilogy. Batman isn't exactly the cool hero with fancy gadgets nor is he the strongest. His inner strength is tested, he is physically and mentally pushed to his limits and all odds are against him. What an epic finale!

Christian Bale as always is perfect as Bruce Wayne and Batman but Tom Hardy's portrayal of Bane almost steals the show. Unlike Batman's mask where you get to see the emotions through eyes and mouth of the actor, Bane's mask covers his entire mouth, leaving only his eyes in view. Despite an obscured face, actor Tom Hardy seems to have found a way to brilliantly express his emotions physically! He projects Bane's character, the strength, pain, attitude and the darkness by movements and body language alone! Bane is as intellectual as he is strong, which makes him genuinely terrifying. He is easily the most formidable of all Batman villains in the trilogy and simply owned the scenes he was in.

Hans Zimmer does an excellent job with the background score that sets the pace of the movie and compliments the visual artistry. The music makes you feel the excitement and energy of the movie. Both Anne Hathaway and Joseph Gordon-Levitt do justice to their characters. Hathaway is believable as Catwoman. Last but not the least, Michael Caine gives a very effective and heartfelt performance as Alfred.

The special effects in this movie are so good, that it seems very real. The Batpod, which made its appearance in Dark Knight is back in this movie and it is exceedingly cool. But wait till you see 'The Bat'!

This movie has a stellar start, will keep you on the edge of your seat with adrenaline-pumping action sequences, intense drama both emotional and dark, has several layers of the story interweaving with frequent curve balls thrown in. But the movie never loses momentum, it ultimately sets you up for a fantastic climax and probably a very unpredictable yet satisfying end. It will keep you guessing till the very last second and that is the magic of Christopher Nolan's amazing masterpiece, The Dark Knight Rises.

I will give this movie 10 out of 10."
"Every time a good superhero movie is made ,fanatic fanboys have to rush to IMDb to declare it as the ""Greatest Movie Ever Made"" LOL,, I do give them credit for a least being consistent. With that said, it was a good movie but should not even be in any top 100. Yes, the storyline was far fetched for real life but hey, it's the norm for a sci-fi thriller action movie. Villain wants to destroy stuff,, hero must stop him. It was well acted, and the action, while not ground breaking was shot very well. While Anne Hathaway is great to look at, and done an okay job , I felt you could of totally removed her character from the entire film and it would not have made any difference . It was almost like her role was just filler material. In the end to me it's just a fun summer movie to get lost in,,but not to put on a pedestal..."
"The Dark Knight rises is easily the most anticipated film of the year and has a lot to live up to with the previous two entries just seeming to get better and better. With the same creative team intact, can Nolan and Bale pull off the ultimate finale to their trilogy and deliver the film we've all been waiting for or will it fall to the dreaded bad third film syndrome that seems to plague most series?

The Dark Knight Rises continues the journey of Batman eight years after he took the fall for the death and crimes of Harvey Dent. Forced back into action to take on the terrorist Bane, the Dark Knight returns to protect the city that looks at him as an enemy. The Dark Knight was a brilliant film on numerous levels so going in this film already had a big hurdle to overcome. While it may not have completely overshadowed the previous entry, it easily finds its place on equal ground. This final entry to the Nolan series continues to bring these three films together becoming essentially one long film. Rises brings new realm of personal journey to numerous characters old and new. Christian Bale steps back into the role like he never left bringing a new pain that seems to elevate both Wayne and Batman to another level. Most fans will be happy to know that while the growl like voice is still here, it is toned down a bit so not to be quite as off putting. Michael Caine is given a bit more to do taking the character study between Alfred and Wayne that has been building and he delivers more of his motivational and emotional speeches like only he can. Gary Oldman gets a bit more to do as well getting to channel the Gordon we have been waiting for since the beginning. Tom Hardy steps into the role of Bane, a character that is met with mixed emotions. Known in the comics as the villain that broke the bat, has had many incarnations, most of them not all that good and not widely known to those that aren't comic fans. Believe it or not, Nolan has taken a fairly single dimension character and brought to life a destructive force that smashes through this film with no remorse. The big surprise was Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle aka Catwoman. She seemed to be channeling some of the previous versions, most notably that of the 60's series minus the camp. She really makes this character work bringing the sexiness as well as a more empowered woman aspect to the character. She is easily the best incarnation of this character so far.

The story is well crafted bringing all the characters together along with the story to create an epic piece of filmmaking. There are numerous levels to the story that worked well for every character giving each of them their own small story without ever making the film feel overcrowded or forced. It takes a bit to get going, but not in a bad way. There are some pretty heavy moments that push this film along, but will keep you away from the action for longer than you may want. Much like the source material this trilogy is a character study of the inner struggles of a man and not so much about the action. Make no mistake there are plenty of action sequences, each bigger than the next. Nolan has slowed the action down a bit, namely during the fight scenes letting the viewer finally get a better glimpse of the Dark Knight in action. Kudos to Nolan as gone are most of the fancy well-choreographed fights and in their place is a brutality that is needed to make the Bane story work.

This is not only a great film, but a brilliant cap to an already brilliant series. It's a truly amazing experience to see this film come to life and wrap up a series that has continued to get better and better. There are plenty of moments that will make both comic and non-comic fans alike smile and cheer. Nolan has stamped his mark on the Batman universe and has done something almost never thought possible. He has delivered a brilliant Batman trilogy and managed to keep the entire brilliant cast in tact all the way down to members of the Wayne Corp board members. This is a film that will make you cheer and sad that it is coming to an end. As this series comes to an end and the credits role you will find yourself sighing in relief and happiness knowing Nolan pulled it off and wondering what's next for the Batman."
"Ultimately, this is an excellent film, but after seeing this as part of an all night trilogy viewing, I have to say it is not as good as The Dark Knight.

The film opens with, strangely for Nolan a quite farcical scene that introduces Bane. I won't spoil it, but please tell me, who takes 3 unknown prisoners on a plane without even looking at their faces? Really??

The proper story starts, and to chose words like jaded, withdrawn, cynical, tired, lethargic and disconnected, is how we find our hero and Police commissioner. So ultimately this is how the audience is manipulated into feeling too, and so act 1 is ultimately a long ""downer"" as lots of elements are put in place for the last 2 acts. But, after sitting through six hours of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, I was left feeling it was too much, and I started getting bored with the overall emotional shade of the film, coupled with the lack of action and the lack of any real story. It was like watching a plate spinner getting 40 plates spinning on pointy poles, necessary for his act, but ultimately boring for his audience.

The second Act is where our bad guy makes his play and gains the upper hand. One of the strongest sources of praise for The Dark Knight, is the ultimately real-world story telling. But what Bane unleashes on Gotham, takes us back to the more comic book villainy of the first film, which I won't criticise, but for me is not as rewarding as the realism of the second film. All the while our good guys are slow, wrong footed, and creaking under their mental baggage, so we are two thirds through a superhero film, where our superhero has been anything but. Action has been thin on the ground, and we have all been through the ringer, and we are crying for some redeeming pay-off.

After the third act, our her is restored, all has been put right. However, ultimately our pay-off for all we have been put through in the first two acts is only satisfying if you can shrug off the memory of what you have just been put through. It's much like childbirth, you need your brain to be swimming with endorphins to blank out the pain of labour, and for me, I didn't get enough endorphins to make the experience totally rewarding.

Add to this, a slightly facial bad-guy twist, and a groan-worthy sequel shoe-in, I have to say that Nolan has tried to squeeze in far too much, and Batman's saga creeps over the line, rather than ending with a bang, so much so, you will feel convinced that this is not the final part of the story, and we will need another installment to accept that our hero has sailed off into the sunset."
"Apologies, Dominus, I have done many reviews here but to get this one right took me 5 years and multiple re-watchings.

Conclusion? Not merely great, but the ""great-est"" superhero film of all time. The story is iconic and majestic in scope. The script not merely good, it borders on perfection. The performances are nothing less than stunning.

Bale and Oldman could not give a bad performance even if you asked them. Hathaway has never looked this good, her height and frame infusing her Catwoman with a vibe never seen before or since. And the almost-invisible Tom Hardy (one of the greatest actors of our age, BTW) makes Bane as interesting a character, if not moreso, than even Darth Vader himself.

So why did this review take me 5 years? To discover the dissonance between the three parts of the trilogy, which is the only flaw, the Achilles Heel of the boxed set.

Ordinarily a trilogy should be harmonious and consistent. Look at the original Lord of the Rings as the best example. Each part not only stands on its own but, taken in sequence, the story builds, the characters become clearer, everything works to a conclusion.

Like an orchestra reaching a crescendo.

Not so here. The whole is weakened by the sum of the parts. Batman Begins is, frankly, sloppy. Great ideas and even great performances are lost in a weak narrative with a unsatisfying conclusion.

The Dark Knight has become iconic in its own right but not because of the way it continues the story, but rather because of the amazing one-of-a-kind performance by Ledger.

It is only when we get to Part 3 that we achieve perfection. This film is not merely better than than the first two, it may be the best film of its genre, ever."
"It's been eight years since the events of the immediate predecessor to this(a film that this matches in most ways, tops in several, and the only thing it lacks that that has, is Heath Ledger's Joker, and, well, that's part force majeure), and we see the outcome of that. Legislation has made organized crime a thing of the past in the city, and with no need for the caped crusader, Bruce(once again impeccably acted by Bale... and yes, the voice has thankfully been toned down) has a gap in his life that he doesn't know how to fill(straining the relationship between him and Alfred, played by the usually charming and compelling Caine). When a mysterious masked man, known as Bane, a dominating physical presence with a brain(played largely by Hardy's eyes and brows... taking a ton of his tools as an actor away, and still he does incredible), with unclear motives makes his presence known, he realizes he will have to become Batman again. But is he enough to take out this new threat? This finishes the series, providing closure to the characters and story. Catwoman is done right here, and just about perfect. She's finally a femme fatale... hot and manipulative. They do with her what we hoped they'd do with Black Widow. And this does justice to the relationship between her and Wayne. The performances are great all around. Most return from the other two(and Freeman gets a lot more to do), with a few new faces, such as Gordon-Levitt as idealistic cop John. This does a lot to surprise us, and like TDk, it does it right, with hardly any of them being unnecessary, and none of them insulting. The bleakness is back and amplified - this puts its titular hero and its audience through a serious amount of pain and conflict, with a genuine feeling that it might not work out. And as a result of this, and other brave decisions made(you can barely believe these are mainstream movies!), it becomes really powerful, really draws us in. The action is the biggest and best of these(the jet he uses is awesome! And the Pod gets some more really cool use, in the edge-of-your-seat chases, and we get fast martial arts(and covered well!), and the stakes and tension are the highest(and frankly, if they were raised any higher, it would be excessive... this is already as draining as the last one). There is a lot of disturbing content, some violence and a little moderate to strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone interested in these(and make sure you've watched the other two first, this really adds to them). 10/10"
"Got to watch it in a preview show here in India. Was stunned with the way Nolan has narrated the story. It is simply AWESOME! Everything looks so perfect here, right from the starting, till the end credits roll. Even though i am not an ardent fan of action/superhero movies, I liked the first two installments of the series, so the expectation for this was so huge. And to be frank, i am happy with the outcome. Ii is brilliant in every aspect. Nolan's direction is top-notch and he is the real hero of the movie. I even felt goosebumps in certain sequences. I do not want to reveal the story much, but what i can say is, this one is a must for every movie lover. Such an awesome performance from Tom Hardy! I was just amazed to see him perform Bane. Christian Bale is no less, he is literally perfect reprising his role from the previous two films. The other actors have done good job. But i missed Heath Ledger, may his soul rest in peace. Anyway, what i have to say is, do not miss this film, lest it is a real loss for you. I would like to rate it 8.5/10, And Hats off to Nolan and the entire crew for giving us such a cinematic experience."
"Another achievement by Nolan Bros. and Warner Bros... Thanks to its huge budget available (ca 230 million USD) one could use state-of-the-art technology and employ a dream-team of actors of different generations: Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Anne Hathaway, Joseph Gordon-Levitt... And they got the opportunity to have elaborated roles to play, not just appearing in the background; Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth is probably the finest of the great ones. Moreover, it is no comic strip movie, but an epic story of universal values, attitudes and issues, with superhero and sci-fi moments complementing the script, not governing it.

Minuses from me due to length (ca 2,5 hours) and too obvious references/comparisons with characters from other hit movies (e.g. Hannibal, Catwoman, James Bond). But still, the movie is worth watching and recommendable!"
"This movie is full of excitement, explosions, and edge of your seat moments. It ties up all of the loose ends in a great culmination to the series. The casting is perfect. I was surprised by some of the characters that were added. I would have liked to see the story line continued though. It is a bit of a let down that they didn't incorporate more of the villains.Or even continue the series to include cooperative adventures for multiple DC heroes.It is great that they managed to keep all of the same actors from the previous movies. It irritated me when they changed the actress who played Rachel. I think that this is a good date movie or movie for a family with older children. Of course it is great for a guys night. Make sure you have you popcorn ready."
"As the ending chapter in the trilogy I enjoyed this movie the most. It had more of Bruce Wayne than just Batman. It showed Bruce's face behind the Batman mask and did so believably. Like we all know the Joker took the spotlight in the previous film and the first one was more Batman action. So we got a trilogy with a balanced focus between the guise, the seamlessly corrupt and the person behind the guise. Which is nice.

As a movie about the struggling person behind the mask this was, for me, the most touching out of the three films. And the most hope inducing, seeing Bruce Wayne recollect himself from the pit and rise to stand on his own feet. Re-mustering his courage and will."
"The Dark Knight Rises (2012)

*** 1/2 (out of 4)

The final film in Christopher Nolan's trilogy finds Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) coming out of retirement and putting on the Batman suit as he tries to save Gotham City from a nuclear weapon being controlled by Bane (Tom Hardy). THE DARK KNIGHT RISES isn't quite as good as the previous film but I'd put it a little ahead of the first movie in the series but no matter how you rank them you really have to give Nolan, Bale and company credit for really delivering a very special series that I'm sure went a lot higher than most people thought when news broke that this group would be taking over the franchise. While this film is far from perfect there are still so many great things that it's easy to get lost in the film and caught up in the various situations going on. I think the strongest thing going for the picture is the wonderful visual style and as with the previous two films, the way Nolan builds this dark atmosphere and city is just something so many other directors should be studying going forward. Another major asset is that Bale can bring that dark and mysterious nature to the Wayne character while at the same time being very believable in the part of Batman. I think it's fair to say that he's put his stamp on the character and if this is his last go at it then he's done more than any previous actor. The supporting cast includes strong work from Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Mario Cotillard and Gary Oldman. Hardy was extremely good in the villain role of Bane and really helped make the film so much fun. Anne Hathaway gives a decent performance as Catwoman but I must admit that I thought the screenplay really didn't do much for the character and in the end she had little impact with me. The 164-minute running time does seem a bit too drawn out at spots but I was still rather amazed at how well it flowed and this credit certainly goes to Nolan. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES closes this trilogy and really ends it with a bang and it's clear that the series going forward will have a lot to live up to."
The writing is horrible and the pace is agonizingly draining.
"To be honest....there's not much to say about this movie. I am an avid film critic and I am completely lost for words.

Christopher Nolan is the best director/writer/producer/creator right now and now arguably of all time. Christian Bale = consistently phenomenal. Tom Hardy = unbelievable. Hewitt = great young actor. Hathaway = incredible. Freeman = Freeman, enough said.

The Dark Knight Rises has not only set the bar for superhero/action movies, but movies of all genres. 15/10..yup. Unbelievable.

There really isn't much to say about this movie because honestly there is nothing to compare it too. NO movie comes close...try to argue it and I will leave you in the dust. Enough said...I'm done. WOW"
"Before I get down-voted because I'm not giving 'The Dark Knight Rises' a 10 (the trend most of the users on her seem to be following), I'll list the numbers of things I really enjoyed about the film, and there were plenty.

-The cast Nolan's able to put together to end his trilogy is really something to marvel at. From the veterans of the series (Bale, Freeman, Caine, Oldman) to the new faces (Gordon-Levitt, Cotillard, Hathway, Hardy) each bring their all to their characters, even if a few are somewhat undeveloped (more on that later).

-Action scenes. 'Batman Begins,' while I admire it for it's first look at the gritty take to the comic formula, had some incredible poor and incomprehensible fight scenes, where it was unclear how who punching what or what was happening. In 'The Dark Knight,' the scenes were much more clear, a big improvement. Here, the fighting scenes are at their best. When Baine and Batman throw down, it's some of the most intense fight scenes I've seen in a long time.

-Huge setpieces. I could say that about all of these movies, but in this film especially. Gotham City is beautifully recognized. It's always great to see a huge place like this down naturally, never been plagued by artificial CGI (Nolan uses as little as possible.) Not to mention the number of extras, which number in the thousands.

-The ending. Even if it jumps the shark, the ending to Nolan's epic trilogy is overall fulfilling. Fans of the series won't be disappointed, even if the casual might

Not that that's out of the way, the problems I had with the film. . .

-Bane's voice. When we first meet Bane, on a plane, his voice was nearly unbearable. It sounded like something a ten-year-old would do when playing with audio effects on his computer. The dialogue didn't help, as he spewed out clunky one-liners. Here was Bane, with his terrifying appearance,sounding like a cartoon. It did improve over the ocurse of the movie, but the first introduction to the character was something I almost couldn't shake off.

-Too many character introductions. Maybe this is a criticism of the whole trilogy, but I'll have to put the blame on this one. Too many characters are brought in, with their developments feeling rushed. It almost appears like Nolan adds these new additions to the script at the last minute.

For the most part, the good outweighs the bad. It's a very entertaining film and, as far as summer blockbusters, it's definitely worth the price of admission.

7/10"
"I have seen all of the batman movies (all of them) and saying the The Dark Knight Rises is the best out of any of them is no understatement. Nolan delivers a spectacular conclusion to the best trilogy I've ever witnessed in the cinemas. Every camera shot, order of scenes, and the dialogue was so meticulously delivered, it sets the bar pretty damn close to perfection.

Lets start off with the actors, Christian Bale reprised the role of Batman brilliantly. Failure, redemption, and all the emotions that took part in his character, Bale delivered and did to convincingly. Anne Hathaway, although she had big shoes to fill (pheiffer) did not disappoint. I could see why a younger fresher actress beaten out the likes of Angeline Jolie and Charlize Theron for the role. The Selina Kyle in Nolan's interpretation was cunning, intelligent, beautiful, deadly and yet humane. The veterans (john michael cane, morgan freeman) were fantastic as expected. The real surprise for me was Tom Hardy. The manifestation of Bane. The first thing that came to my mind while I was walking out of the theater was how much fear the character had conveyed. Not only in his own actions but how people reacted to his character. I am sort of tired so I will stop here. I must say though, to all who love bashing movies, save it for another. This movie is one to see. Don't wait for it come out on bluray or download it, go to the theater and watch it. It is not a movie, but an experience."
"I was super excited since the very day when the trailer of the movie came out and was waiting ever eagerly for another master piece by one of the greatest movie makers of all time Christopher Nolan. I was fortunate enough to see it first day. And yes it was not all disappointing as the movie was truly amazing.

The story line woven intricately with all the characters touches you heart, mind and soul and you wish that the experience never ends and keeps you on the edge of the seat till the end of the movie.

Nolan has definitely added another master-piece to his ever-lasting collection and the grand finale will truly leave you spell-bound.

Christian bale as impressive as usual and Tom Hardy plays the Bane flawlessly.

Anna Hathaway does justice so as ever depending Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine. Joseph is also amazing.

Hans Zimmer music leaves is awesome which will be ringing in your ears even after you have left the cinema ! Oh boy, what we all have been waiting for is here and a must see for everyone !!!!!

One of the best trilogies ever made !

YES, THE DARK KNIGHT HAS RISEN !!!! Dey-shey dey-shey Bah-sur-rah bah- sur-rah !!!!!"
"Christopher Nolan does not make simple movie anymore, does he? I was emotionally exhausted right from the start to finish in this captivating 2 hours and 45 minutes of viewing, I barely have time to digest the richness of its storytelling and it lingered in my mind long after experienced it.

The Dark Knight Rises (TDKR) is a fitting epic ending to the most compelling, ambitious superhero movie trilogy ever. In term of audaciousness, the closest I can think of is another DC Comics, Watchmen (Snyder, 2009), without a doubt you are looking at the pinnacle of superhero comic movie adaptation in these two. Both have equal brooding style, Watchmen has a superior narrative style because it is benefited from a direct existing material while Nolan's Batman trilogy punches pure entertainment with accessibility to both general audience and comic geeks.

By the 3rd part of trilogy, gone are the days of the main characters' introduction, where we are straight to the engrossing pay off time.Batman's vehicle evolved from Tumbler who looks like tank to a two-wheels Batpod to The Bat that fly with ease (yes, Lucius Fox confirms that it comes in black colour). The story sets 8 years after the event of The Dark Knight where Bruce Wayne went into long hiatus. The newcomer Anne Hathaway plays the role of Catwoman. Under normal circumstances, she and Catwoman do not belongs to the same bracket, but somehow she pull it off with the seductive performance coupled with the touch of insecurity from her. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays as a closed aide to Commissioner Gordon. Meanwhile, Marion Cottillard is an important figure in Wayne Enterprise.

The main villain, Bane is played by Tom Hardy where his presence on the screen is downright menacing. He is physically tough and hulky. He may not be as intimidating as Joker, but somehow I fear for anyone who is near to him because he seems like he would snap the neck of the person standing next be it his henchmen or enemy. I really felt for Batman during one of the brutal knuckle fight with Bane. He absolutely gives Batman a painful thumping. On the grand scale, he masterminded a sinister plan for the downfall of Gotham City. He strikes the people of Gotham with fear, he actually gives the Gotham citizens some faint hope before striking it down with furious vengeance, all before the eyes of a helpless Bruce Wayne. Given the fleshed out background story, it is obvious Bane is the most complex villain in TDK trilogy.

I am pleased that we are now at the second decade of the golden age of superhero comic movie adaptation where there are plenty of choices we are spoilt of. The sky is the limit as far as CGI is concern, nowadays no matter how transcendent the comic is, the cinema medium just easily lift the concept from the comic book panels. While Joss Whedon's The Avengers is fun, loud, a kind of borderline juvenile stuff, TDKR on the other hand is a serious, realistic, brooding, Gothic feel drama. It stings to say this because I am a huge follower of Joss. Let me reiterate that The Dark Knight Rises is an epitome to action-orientated movie; not just limit to superhero comic adaptation genre. Whoever wants to remake a movie about Batman after Christopher Nolan, I wish him/her best of luck.

My movie review at www.sowyau.blogspot.com/"
"I would like to suggest that researching anything to deep about this film is a bad idea. Go into it with a clean slate. The experience will be ruined for you if you do not.

REVIEW IN SUMMARY:

The movie was phenomenal. It never slows, and I was surprised it was over when the time came. If you've disliked the pacing of past Nolan films, you will be fine with this one. This movie has incredible acting, a beautiful story, and is the perfect end to the Trilogy.

FULL REVIEW:

For starters, the Nolan brothers have created a masterpiece of a script. The themes explored in this film are stirring, and inspiring. The story is beautiful, and full of depth. Those of you looking for a simple mindless thriller will probably find this film to be, ""alright"", but you won't get the hype behind it. You won't understand everyone's obsession with this film. If you haven't liked Nolan's previous work, you won't like this one. It's not about the action, or the simple mindless battles many superhero movies today are all about. It's not as simple as those are. But do not despair, there is more large scale action in this then any of the other Batman films thus far.

But, it is easy to follow. Even if you haven't seen the other movies in the franchise you will understand it. The other movies add depth, so I suggest you see the other two films before you see this one, but all the same you'll be able to follow it.

Chris Nolan tells the story well. It wasn't as choppy and unorganized as some of his past films. This one is by far his best work.

Tom Hardy brings an elegance to the villain of Bane that is addicting. Yes, you read right, and elegance. Class. He is a classy villain, whose motivations are understandable, and frighteningly relatable. This is, in my opinion, his best work aside from Warrior.

As far as comparisons to the Joker go, it's like comparing an apple to an orange. Except when you bight into Bane, and the threat he presents, you'll forget the Joker even existed.

Anne Hathaway won't be disappointing. I know I, like many of you, was worried when we saw that name on the cast list. But she does fine.

This movie will stir your emotions. Satisfy your need for action. Satisfy your need for Batman. And satisfy your need for insurmountable villains. It will also satisfy those who have read the comics. Although this story does not follow in exactness to any original comic, Nolan cleverly manipulates the characters to fit the comic agenda, in a more ""modern"" or ""realistic"" sense.

This film is full of surprises. So I suggest you stop reading these reviews, avoid potential spoilers, and go enjoy the show."
"Title says it all. Epic storyline, perfect musical score, perfect acting, and one of the most emotional endings I have ever seen. This trilogy is the ""star wars"" of our generation. I'm not kidding. Oh, and for all of you IMDb users posting about the plot holes...really? People, it's called ""willing suspension of disbelief"" ever heard of it?

Go see the film and enjoy yourself. This is the one of the only action film I have seen outside of its prequel that doesn't sacrifice story for more explosions. Every character is fully realized and acts their part in such a convincing manner that they become more 3-dimensional than most characters do throughout an entire trilogy.

And Bane? Oh man, Bane is one of the best villains you will ever have the pleasure to see (and quite a well-scripted one too).

This is more than a comic-book film. This is a new classic. The Dark Knight has risen."
"Words cannot express how I felt after watching The Dark Knight Rises.. A sense of hope that even in the most dismal of situations one should have. A sense of relief that this trilogy did not go in the way of most trilogies. A sense of sadness that this would be the last batman movie in the Nolan franchise. But more than all this, I was elated and joyous about the way this movie kept my interest throughout the whole 2 hrs 45 min. To say one word about this film.. EPIC !!! . All the characters completely complimented one another. Was especially astounded by Bale, Hathaway, Hardy and Caine's performances. I am definitely going once again for this one."
"So let me start out with the negatives. This film was the least great of the three in my opinion. It had some major plot holes and confusion at the ending. But that's also something that made it great, because it is an ending that could be interpreted in different ways. So in one way, it could not be seen as a major plot hole although it has in my book. Anywho, the main antagonist Bane is one of my favorites. Find out in the film to see why, because it sure took me by a bit of surprise. On the other hand, some other appearances were quite obvious to be, but still enjoyable nonetheless. In general Christopher Nolan has made an epic trilogy that surely will stay a classic over the years to follow."
I love that this is all one big action sequence it really keeps you on your toes with a lord of the rings type war story for the climax a good movie for someone who looks for a thrill.
"First of all, when I was in the theater watching (The Dark Knight) I said to myself that there's no way I'm going to miss the next movie in this series. after the epic nature and the overwhelming performance also the art of directing that makes you live inside the movie as we have seen in The Dark Knight, I expected this one to be at least the same level and I was absolutely correct. Christopher Nolan is the best Director out there, the way he makes you become part of the movie and feel the same feeling of every character you see is just magical, and add to that the fantastic music of Hans Zimmer, not to mention the Perfect Selection of the Actors and Actresses in this movie. Before The Dark Knight all of us used to watch super hero movies and consider them the kind of thing that would never happen in real life but things changed after the epic clash between batman and the Joker, The Dark Knight Rises even make it more reasonable it makes you think that if there was a batman he would be exactly like this. and it is being proved in each scene as you go through the movie, how hard it is to live with the cruelty of bane, how it is really hard to find weapons and devices to use that they use everything they got (unlike other action movies that everyone suddenly have a 100 gun when it is time to fight) it is like what would really happen if Bane came to your city and Batman was to defend it. in other words you can call this movie a masterpiece,if you didn't watch it yet then what are you waiting for?"
"As everyone i went to this movie with lot of expectations,you know what? Nolan has done an unimaginable Batman movie which can be done only by him. He is a master in what he does.Coming to the movie,from the first frame the movie was absorbing and mind blowing. The Character of Bane was portrayed brilliantly. All the characters does their part 10/10.The twists in the story were awesome and was absolutely unpredictable.The Visual Effects were way too good. Lots of humor in the movie when compared to previous Nolan movies.The combination of classy dialogs and performance of the actors make it the best movie of Nolan so far.To end NOLAN DOES IT AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!:)"
"Immediately, probably, it should be stipulated that I'm not a fan of superhero films, I'm not a fan of comics, and even from cartoons, I'd rather have chosen ""Tom and Jerry"" than a cartoon about Batman. But despite all the first two films of the trilogy described above, I liked them very much. The reason for this is probably the cool, noir atmosphere of Gotem created by the directors, the fine acting and, of course, the good script stories. Well, after such a long introduction, it is logical to ask the question, what about the third part? Nothing! Absolutely nothing! In the final part of the trilogy there is absolutely nothing that I liked in the first two previous parts of the trilogy. The weakest part of the film is probably the script, and this fact is very surprising, as Christopher in all his works spent a lot of time developing the script (which is only the scenario of ""Memento""). Think about the reasons why the script in this picture is so weak you can endlessly. It is worth saying that most of the film is trying to build an exhibition, to reveal the main actors, but the author does not get it in the end, half the time is incredibly boring watching. So the script is so drawn and adjusted for the denouement that it's simply impossible not to notice it, it simply contradicts all laws of logic and healthy meaning. The performances of some scenes are very depressing, many battle scenes also give up cretinism, and it is not clear how they can be looked at. Yes, in the end, Christopher prepared his own story twist, but even he did not work and was predictable and boring. And as for the final scenes, I'm sorry, I could not stand it, how much forgiveness do I have to spit on all the laws of physics, science and just common sense, what would come up with this ?! Well, in general, with the plot all. The second question that arose after watching where the atmosphere of Gotham City had gone? Yes, she just took and evaporated not that noir style for which I loved the first two films of the trilogy, now Gotham is an ordinary boring metropolis, which is simply not interesting to watch. Why was this done or why? There are no answers, alas, it's sad. Well, the last point is an actor's game. Yes, I did not expect something outstanding. In principle, there was nothing outstanding on the screen, all that was that good actors gave out a good game and in sum with the above described it looked again extremely boring and not interesting. It's time to sum up and draw some conclusions. This picture is the weakest in the filmography of a good director Christopher Nolan. As it is not surprising, but basically the script was let down, of course, as a result of which the whole film is simply impossible to watch, the atmosphere and appeal were lost as in the two previous parts of the trilogy. Who can recommend this film, well, probably only to fans of superhero cinema and comic book fans. To all other lovers of good cinema, this film is by no means worth watching. I have everything."
"In my opinion I think this is the best movie of Nolan's Batman trilogy. It's more interesting, enjoyable and emotional. The acting performance is brilliant and the cast has been chosen perfectly. The end is one of the most beautiful endings I've seen, it's phenomenal and remarkable. All things about this movie will still in my memory because it's simply a great masterpiece and I really loved it. Finally if you haven't seen this trilogy yet then I can definitely recommend it."
"I feel The Dark Knight Rises is the best of Nolan's Trilogy in overall entertainment. The hallmark of this series is its dark, gritty realism, at least as realistic as you can get for a superhero movie. I prefer this approach to the semi-goofy style of the 1989-97 series.

Bane's a formidable villain and Anne Hatheway surprisingly plays a good ""Catwoman"" (I say ""surprisingly"" only because I thought she has too innocent/sweet of a quality to pull off the role). Also on hand is Marion Cotillard, who's stunning as Miranda Tate, and Joseph Gordon-Levite, who's effective as police officer Blake. Beyond these we get the principal characters/cast of the first two films, minus the Joker and Harvey Dent.

My only beef with this series is that the plots are convoluted and there's an overload of characters, which means you really have to pay attention or you'll get lost in the process. This is never a problem when a story is ultra-compelling, but none of these films are, although ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is definitely the most compelling of the three. This factor is what keeps this series from being great in my opinion.

But don't take that the wrong way; I'm just being honest. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a quality Batman film.

The film runs 165 minutes and was shot in Pittsburgh (Gotham City), England, Scotland, India, Italy, New York, Newark and California.

GRADE: B+"
"Bane, who sounds like modern day activists who claims to give authority to everyone, wants to distribute everything to everyone and ends up making them indirectly slaves of the authority. On the other hand it shows Bruce really becoming the hero without mask, he learns that fear is good to have as it makes one stronger and vigilant. The way this story is narrated is surreal. For me this is the peak Batman. The character arcs are shown in way, where you can connect with them, the way it shows that all you need is courage to fight the tyranny and heroes do have flaws too. Such superhero movies are gone now in the era of over preaching content and heavy visuals."
Catwoman was mind-blowing..! I saw 3 together..batman begins...dark knight ..and dark knight rises..as per rating dark knight is the best...but in my point of view...this is the best......loved the theory
"The Dark Knight Rises, though not as good as the previous one- The Dark Knight, is fitting for the series finale. In this one, you have Bane and he has great presence throughout the movie and good rivalry with Batman. This one is more about the story and I felt as though this was closer to Batman Begins, as if completing a full circle. In BB, we had Bruce Wayne transform into the Batman and here too he again ""learnt"" to be Batman. He realized that after 8 years of no life at all, he couldn't just don the mask and the cape and become Batman. He again faces fear, learns to overcome it and gets his training in a way.

This movie had a feeling of completeness which is very necessary when the series has ended. The Dark Knight ends in Batman being villain in people's eyes and in this one he literally ""rises""."
This film has the misfortune to be a sequel to one of the greatest films of all time. The Dark Knight is no easy act to follow. However Nolan does an amazing job of adding spectacle to make the final installment of the trilogy memorable. The realism has always made this series stand above the rest. Are there some plot holes? Yes. Do they make it a bad film? No. Go watch Justice League then honestly tell me TDKR is bad. It's not. It is simply over shadowed by its predecessor.
Oh my god this movie was awesome !.and what an amazing ending to a superb trilogy.this movie Can't get better the story the cast everything is just too perfect.and no one is better than Chrestian Bale for this movie he is a very talented actor with a really special acting skills.i am confused why anyone well hate this movie its one of the best movie for all ages ! in my opinion its the best action movie of 2012.and of course the well directing and superb special effects of the movie makes it more amazing.what a blockbuster movie is this.this movie is no doubt a most watch and best of the year and it deserved an Oscar at least.
"Christopher Nolan concludes his epic vision of the Batman franchise in high style, as Christian Bale returns as the caped crusader, after masked henchman Bane threatens to destroy Gotham. This stuff is candy for superhero aficionados, and Nolan manages to balance a large cast without shortchanging anyone. Drawn from his slumber by mysterious cat burglar Selina Kyle, the Batman faces what may be his biggest and most dangerous test yet as Bane wields a nuclear explosive and threatens to detonate. Secrets from the past are revealed, and loose ends tied. Tremendous support from Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Mariana Cotilliard, and others. This is a film to make you stand up and cheer. Fun comic fable, perhaps not up to the standard of the prior classic, but does amazing things with it's large budget and well worth viewing."
"The action was pretty mediocre at best. The plot was decent but most things were pretty predictable. Even the ""surprise"" evil villain at the end was predictable. During the movie I turned to my girlfriend and said ""$20 says she ends up being a bad guy at the end."" needless to say I got a pat on the head later.

Is the movie good? Yes. Is the movie great? Depends.... it is great for the fans of the movies but in general its not a masterpiece. I feel it deserve a 8 on IMDb at the very best. The fact that its so high rated right now is pretty unrealistic.

Everyone saying Bane was the greatest villain of all time with amazing acting? I disagree... I still think Heath did a better job as the Joker. I feel Bane was a cool character but I don't feel he at all lived up to the hype provided in other reviews.

The movie is a must see for the year, but it is something you can watch on DVD and still get the same effect. No idea how they spent so much money on this movie... the action wasn't that good."
"Christopher Nolan is the greatest film maker of all time. Big statement, I know. But let's think about that statement for a second... he has not made a bad film (Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins, The Prestige, The Dark Knight, Inception and his earlier work Following) So how does such a brilliant film maker finish off a trilogy that changed super hero movies forever, which included one of the greatest films (in any genre - The Dark Knight) of all time?

The Dark Knight Rises is the conclusion the trilogy deserves. Is it better than The Dark Knight? That's debatable. It's a very different type of movie. But it is the movie that was needed to end this trilogy, it's the movie that Batman fans will appreciate and love for years and years to come.

Christopher Nolan has just possibly made the greatest movie trilogy of all time."
"The unprecedented fervor surrounding the release of the final Batman film of Christopher Nolan's highly acclaimed trilogy is something we probably should have seen coming. Fans of the films are rabid about the movies getting their just dues, and it's become the (unfortunate) habit of many a fanboy to go ballistic on anyone who is a naysayer. That said, these people are devotees of the series for a reason: each of the two previous offerings have been nothing short of fantastic, and there was no reason to believe that the third—and final—installment, The Dark Knight Rises, would be any different.

The question that's on everyone's mind, of course, is if it really does meet (and ultimately exceed) the impossibly high standards set by its predecessors. The answer is a resounding ""yes."" The Dark Knight Rises is incredibly ambitious and incredibly satisfying; it's also the best film of the trilogy.

Allow me to explain why.

In both Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, Gotham was in peril. Madmen assailed the city's citizens for varying reasons—some more concrete than others—while a troubled hero in Bruce Wayne sought to use his resources (namely access to incredibly advantageous weaponry and a whole slew of kick-assery he obtained while a brief member of the League of Shadows) to disarm those would see the town destroyed. While his character has always been interesting, Bruce Wayne hasn't been a truly engrossing dramatic figure. That all changes with The Dark Knight Rises.

Here, we see Bruce/Batman's tragedy and redemption come around full circle. At the start of the movie, Wayne is a man crippled by the exploits he's undertaken as the caped crusader. He's a recluse who's holed up in Wayne Manor. As we're allowed to see him move beyond exchanging witty barbs with his longtime butler (and caretaker) Alfred Pennyworth, the emotional pay-dirt finally emerges, and the character—in the words of the late Ra's Al Ghul—becomes more than just a man. He becomes the embodiment of grief; here, it's clear that there's a tangible psychological block that's eating Bruce from the inside out. The first hour of Rises is devoted to mining this pain, and it makes Bale's portrayal of Bruce more accessible than ever.

Then there's the action, which hits its stride about halfway through the production. Once it gets going, it's relentless and, for lack of a better word, harrowing. Everything that's happening in the streets of Gotham has weight behind it, as the city faces a challenge unlike anything that's come before.

I feel like I'm on the verge of spilling the beans about some major plot points, so I'll wind things down by saying that the supporting cast—Tom Hardy as Bane and Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle—are all splendid. They each bring something crucial to their characters, and not a moment of screen time is wasted.

I don't need to tell you this, but if you haven't already purchased your ticket for Nolan's epic conclusion to what will go down as one of the best trilogies in movie history, then you need to get on the ball. After all, this is one of those rare occurrences in cinema—the emergence of a truly great movie that actually lives up to every ounce of hype.

Nicely done, Mr. Nolan. You deserve the Oscar nods that are surely coming your way."
"Never has a comic book film make you care about the main character especially throughout a trilogy, these movies should be viewed as one big film, it all adds up and comes to full circle in this one. The acting alone in this movie hits you hard and when Bane appears on the screen it's nail biting. From Christian Bale, Tom Hardy, Ann Hathaway, Michael Caine, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Gary Oldman the list goes on and they make this movie well worth it.

You really feel for Bruce Wayne the most in this movie (because its a batman film) and the ending has the best pay off ever and is very emotional and satisfying. One of the best things about this movie is when you watch it more than once you pick up on things you may have missed which i find more gratifying in a movie, its like watching it all over again and those movies to me are the best, its definitely not a one and done type of movie so you get your moneys worth. This movie definitely deserves the praise it has. Its going to be a long time until someone makes a comic book trilogy as brilliant as this one. Thank you Nolan."
"The special fx and action scenes were cool. The acting by the badguy was not that great. One of the reasons for that was the mask he is wearing. You cant really see the facial expressions and also the voice acting was clearly recorded in studio afterwards. The bad guy visually looking is really cool. The badguy is not that great compared to the previous movie where heat ledger really carried the movie, tom hardy doesn't. Also the storyline and screenplay wasn't that good. They tried to put to much info in to short a time. The characters where a bit shallow because of that, they lacked depth. All in all the movie was entertaining, but not as much as expected."
"First things first. Bane is not the Joker. While the Joker was chaotic,Baneis a mercenary. Ruthless and destructive. When the prologue was shown during MI4, many had voiced concerns about the muffled voice of Bane.That has been corrected to an extent.For those who don't follow comic books,Bane is the villain who broke the bat. And Tom Hardy has done justification to Bane. Mind you when there is a mask covering your face and you sound as a megaphone, it makes your job a little difficult. But his physical presence and his eyes expresses what needs to be expressed.

Before you walk into the theatre, ensure that you seen the previous two films from the trilogy as the story of TDKR is interconnected to both and you may feel lost if you haven't seen them. For those who have , it wouldn't harm to review those films again. Whilst The Dark Knight earned respect and love from worldwide audience mostly due to fact that Heath Ledger was brilliant as the Joker. And his character shines way above Batman's or the story itself, TDKR on the other hand relies more on the story and the inter-relationship of the characters.

Nolan stands true to his word. It is an EPIC conclusion to the Batman trilogy. it is worthy of multiple viewings and I would suggest an IMAX viewing if possible. The scenes, the canvas are breathtaking. So are all the action scenes and of course Mr.Zimmer on the keyboard. The soundtrack fits right into the scenes and enhances the visual experience. The newly added star cast further adds to that experience and fit right into the master puzzle that Nolan has created while his old allies ensure that the movies moral compass is pointed in the right direction. The movie justifies its length of 165 mins and you won't realise how fast they went.

For me the experience would have been far more richer had I not seen Inception or any other Nolan films. Let me explain. Many of the movie scenes are executed and directed on the same lines as Inception. And since I understand how Nolan's concept works, I knew all the twist and turns before they were revealed barring one. The element of surprise wasn't there for me. TDKR is a must watch. And it is a just end to the best comic book adapted movie series ever. Enjoyed it and loved it. Rating 8/10."
"Following a movie event like Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" (2008) is a dangerous game, but then Nolan is a dangerous player. His curious obsession with masculine identity, psychological schisms and the dark night of the soul gave ""Batman Begins"" (2005) a sense of edgy 'reality' that ingratiated him to critics and a good deal of the public, even if it alienated some hard-core Batfans with its customized and highly Nolan-esque take on the Caped Crusader. When his second installment braved the frontier of openly post-9/11 superhero parables, and in so doing gave the late Heath Ledger platform to truly wow audiences and critics the world over, the British director seemed to have galvanized 'superhero noir' as the new benchmark in comic book film adaptation. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012) is his final word on the subject, and while this reviewer feels that it is not a film fit to win over any dissenters or greatly deter any fanatics, it is very largely successful in what it tries to do and its failings are certainly not for a lack of trying.

The first hour or so of the film is a whirlwind of plot necessities that, despite the running time of 165 minutes, probably needed another half an hour or so to unfold with sensicality. They involve introductions to John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) - a rookie cop raised in a city orphanage who apparently ""still believes in the Batman"", even though as far as the audience is concerned he may as well have just moved to Gotham last week – Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) – a cat-burglar who is therefore Catwoman – and Miranda Tate (Marion Cottilard) – a high society Gothamite monetarily invested in a renewable energy program at Wayne Enterprises that has apparently gone bust, even though it seems to work just fine. Excusing a twist in the tale that seems to be there for its own sake, however, Nolan and his co-screenwriter (also known as his brother Jonathan) do not really abide loose ends, and by the commencement of the film's some hour-long climax all the story elements that feel disparate and murky in the beginning have intertwined and solidified into the kind of philosophically powerhouse narrative that made the first two films so effective.

What makes the Nolan films effective is how they appropriated the inalienable tenets of the Batman legend in pursuit of an apocalyptic allegory about the post-9/11 western world. ""Batman Begins"" was a film about fear; the double edged nature of fear's power over a people and how the conquering of fear is invaluable for the pilgrimage of moral valor. ""The Dark Knight"" was a film about Terror, the kind George Bush Jr. declared war against in the early twenty-first century, and about how the greatest tool against Terror is the adherence to moral principles, even if sacrifice and compromise must be allowed for.

""The Dark Knight Rises"" provides a more accurate depiction of terroristic motives in its central villain of Bane than the ""The Dark Knight"" did with The Joker, because he holds Gotham in contempt for its status as a symbol of American first-world 'imperialism'. There has been some critical backlash against Bane as a Villain Without A Face, but this severely undermines Tom Hardy's performance, which actually achieves remarkable presence through nothing but body-language, vocal theatricality and disturbingly expressive eyes. Even without a face, Hardy effortlessly paints a convincing portrait of one who wants to dismantle the lie of Harvey Dent's legacy and incite Gotham into class-warfare riots. He purports to ""liberate"" Gotham's people, but his ultimate goal is to feed Gotham false hope before destroying the whole darn thing and everyone in it. Bane's genuine ideological conflict with western civilization is centered around the power of hope in the eventuation of despair. More than it is a film about fear or Terror, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a film about hope.

In accord with the rest of the trilogy, Bruce Wayne is not the only protagonist whose arc is built around the movie's central thematic concepts. Even the arc supplied for Selina Kyle ends up justifying her seemingly arbitrary insertion into this filmic imagining by providing a suitably dubious object of moral faith for the fallen Dark Knight. She begins with similar outlook to Bane, but the Nolans don't buy into Ra's Al Ghul's assertion that criminals aren't complicated. Everyone, and everything, is complicated.

Oddly enough, it's this principle that is behind most of the shortcomings of the film. It's a little *too* complicated, with the rushed series of first-act events seriously paling in comparison to the emotional impact of the conclusion, and an aforementioned twist that doesn't make much sense. There are also a lot more impossible feats performed by Bruce Wayne here than before, including a near-superhuman healing ability. And where ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"" stood alone very effectively, one can't help but feel that both films are practically required viewing for this one.

But none of that really outweighs the sheer, touching veracity of this finale and its philosophical/moral ambitions, which are all up to par with the predecessors and pay off a great deal of things with a genuine craftsmanship. This ""Batman"" series has always been about the power of symbols in a corrupted world and personal accountability in a society of structural shackles, and when Batman returns to Gotham at the top of the final act to brand his symbol in flames upon the city's largest bridge structure, we are reminded of the paradoxical purity of his message. Even as part of a system that is broken, even funded by a wealth that would perhaps do more good dispersed amongst the third world, even if no one ever knows his name, the Batman fights for the goodness of fallen people (be they cops, cat-burglars or orphans) who may otherwise have never had the chance to rise."
"This movie has everything you could want all while wrapping up one of the best film trilogies. As far as bad guys go Bane is pretty much the epitome of the character type. I personally feel the villains in the trilogy is what makes them so special. The story is great and engaging, it was so good I didn't even realize that the runtime was over 2 hours. If you like dark, gritty, and/or action movies its a must watch. Also it should be noted that you should watch the first 2 films in the series otherwise some stuff might not add up. It wraps up everything in the trilogy and answers pretty much every question you could have. How it relates back to the first movie is quite impressive and after watching this one you'll probably try your best 'bane impression.' His voice is as memorable as his stature. So even if you don't like Batman you must watch it for Bane because he is that amazing. Props to Tom Hardy on his out of the park performance."
"First of all, can I say that when I heard that the Joker wasn't going to be in this movie and that the lead ""bad guy"" was going to be Bane I was thinking ""LAME"". So I tried to go into watching this film with an open mind and I got to say I won't question Chris Nolan's casting, direction or choice of characters again anytime soon. The man is a master and did a masterful job in this third installment of the Batman saga. Bane is an enemy in which Batman has not yet seen, he's physically strong sure but his genius and ruthlessness is truly what's terrifying. He breaks Batman time and again until you almost question whether Batman can really beat him in the end (which is saying something, because we all know he has to right?). The choices of the other actors like Anne Hathaway were spot on, she was magnificent and nailed the cat women character this movie required to succeed. Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Christian Bale were their own usual selves (exceptional) and I really didn't see anyone miscast or turn in anything other then a very strong performance. Overall this movie left me completely happy, the perfect ending to the perfect movie saga. These are not just great super hero movies, to me they're great films period."
"The Dark Knight Rises was my favorite film of the year and from the Dark Knight trilogy.I was looking forward to this movie and it didn't disappoint me.

Positive:epic action scenes ,great acting performances, very good villain emotional ending ,inspiring movie

Negative: some plot wholes that didn't affect me.

Overall the movie was fantastic and I think that it is the one of the best movies ever made.Long live the Batman! Eight years on, a new evil rises from where the Batman and Commissioner Gordon tried to bury it, causing the Batman to resurface and fight to protect Gotham City... the very city which brands him an enemy"
"Am not a great FAN of Super Hero movies, but Nolan Changed the entire mindset. Of course the Film has a lot of loop holes and glitches but that doesn't take away the edge of the seat thrilling heartbeat experience. What i loved most was the way a simple comic story was presented on the screen. I really appreciate Nolan's creativity and presentation.What one needs was an awesome experience and not 100% logic to Action movies. The film stand all amid all minor glitches. The film has a lot of positives, The way Bruce & Tom Hardy character was portrayed, The way Real New York city was presented, The way the Whole experience stood at the end especially Bruce climbing out of the Well. Hans Zimmer Played a wonderful part in giving a master piece. All in All i would recommend everyone to watch whether they like it or not but for the cinematic experience it gives in the end. A Comic Super Hero Movie depicted magnificently after a lot of flops earlier. Nolan has silently conveyed that he is the right man who can do it."
"I just love a good superhero movie, so I happily saw the two Tim Burton offerings (""Batman"" & ""Batman Returns"") and even the pair of inferior Joel Schumacher works (""Batman Forever"" & ""Batman & Robin"") before thoroughly enjoying the British director Christopher Nolan's ""Batman Begins"" (2005) and ""The Dark Knight"" (2008). Four years later, Nolan - who again co-wrote and co-produced - is back with the final and longest part of his acclaimed trilogy. The expectations were very high and Nolan does not disappoint (and deserves particular thanks for not using 3D).

The opening sequence - which I saw in an early trailer - is terrific and almost the best thing in the film and Nolan makes sure that the rest of the story races along with verve and tension, aided by Hans Zimmer's incessant, throbbing score.

It's eight years after the last film and Bruce Wayne (once more the talented Christian Bale) is a broken man, physically, psychologically and even financially. Two contrasting characters arrive in Gotham City to draw him out of retirement: a slinky cat thief (well played by Anne Hathaway who has the most humorous lines) and arch villain Bane (a fearsome-looking Tom Hardy whose lines are unfortunately muffled by his face mask). The Bane character may not be in quite the same chilling class as the brilliant Heath Ledger as The Joker, but Catwoman is a splendid addition to the cast list.

I didn't always understand what was going on - a recent viewing of the two previous films might have helped (who remembers the League of Shadows?) - and I saw it with a friend who was enjoying it for the second time and found the plot more intelligible, so that may be encouragement - if any was needed - to catch it again sometime. But the film always looks wonderful and the action is exciting and unrelenting, satisfyingly alternating from brutally visceral fighting between Batman and Bane to the deployment of some heavy hardware including a bat bike and a bat helicopter.

So, now that Nolan has triumphantly completed his trilogy, does this mean that the crusader is hanging up his cape? No way. The money to be made by continuing the franchise and the setting up of the Robin character (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) means that some other director will soon receive the call from Warner Brothers ..."
"""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012) is the third and final film in Christopher Nolan's trilogy about the comic book superhero Batman, created in 1939 by Bill Finger and Bob Kane. The franchise, starting in 2005 with ""Batman Begins"" and continuing in ""The Dark Knight"" (2008) is brought to a conclusion, and traditional Hollywood thinking is used by the Warner Bros. Studio here: everything is bigger, louder and more explosive and with higher stakes than before. Yet this expansionism hasn't translated into greater quality; if anything, it is the most flawed of the trio. Continuity errors, plot holes and logic defying events plague the film incessantly. The screenplay, by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, feels like it is two or three drafts away from being a finished product. Geopolitical significance is constantly strived for, especially in the latter part of the film, yet it fails to fully grasp its own half-articulated ideas and ends feeling like the pat, smug ""safe"" hawkish ideologies of a studio executive more interested in profit margins than ideas. All these mistakes are a repetition of the previous entry in the series; in many ways this perfectly encapsulates Hollywood: nothing forgotten, nothing learnt.

Still, Nolan's direction is as impressive as ever, really delivering in the large scale set pieces that dot the picture. He brings a real energy to the screen that almost papers over the cracks in the story. The dynamic action scenes are hardly original though and the opening sequence is straight out of a James Bond movie.

The acting is generally of a high standard, with Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Tom Hardy all very good. Unfortunately, the Oscar winning Marion Cotillard is given nothing to do and struggles to create a performance out of a poorly written character.

The cinematography by Academy Award winner Wally Pfister is good and a cut above the usual standard found in the average superhero blockbuster, the same of which can be said for the editing by Lee Smith and the booming music score of Hans Zimmer.

If then this climax to the Batman series is a disappointment, torpedoed by a below par script, then at least Christopher Nolan directs so well that you will be immersed in the film to the point where perhaps you will be more forgiving of its flaws and be swept along by this enjoyable spectacle."
"Wow. Christoper Nolan's third Batman-film is certainly not praised without good reasons, I assure you. The film leaves you speechless, the action combined to great actors and twisty plot, it's just pure beauty. Cannot say any negative thing about this film. Was surpirsed to see so many great actors, including old Stargate-star Christopher Judge in the side role. Can't give away much, so I'm not writing any more. I'm just saying, watch it as soon as you can!"
"The disappointment of the year. could not imagine the duo of nolan brothers getting it wrong. this movie should have been titled "" Cat woman and Bane"" because Batman is just an impotent shadow of his old time over here. Cat woman aka Selina Kyle is given the major amount of the screen time and Hathway is a pretty competent Catwoman. Bane(Tom Hardy) is unfortunately all masked up so he can convey the menace only from the way he walks or talks in that Irish lilt. Michael Caine is excellent in the scenes he is in and so is Morgan Freeman. Marion cotillard is totally wasted. i could not really understand the necessity for her character in the movie and also could not fathom why an Oscar winning actor like her would go for such a two bit role. Joseph Gordon Lewitt creases his forehead throughout the movie and that is pretty much all he does. Christian Bale is above average but he cannot lift a screenplay which is weak and predictable from the very beginning. the only bright spot about the movie is its music which is better than the previous installments. This movie is a disappointment when considered in seclusion. when compared with The Dark Knight and Batman Begins, it is a f**king disaster. very very unhappy."
"That Completes the trilogy.. Just came out from 'The Dark Knight Rises'...Not as mesmerizing as The Dark Knight ,but still Christopher Nolan executed a legendary ending to the series with breathtaking visual moments and fine performances..the movie takes off slowly ,bt the racy 2nd half s just stunning...Hans Zimmer 's score is brutal, percussive and ma ear drums was busting , the Bane Chant wherever he used was goosebumps..Christian Bale continued his legacy in the third part too.. Tom Hardy was a beefy substitute for Heath Ledger in a hell of a villain as the merciless and destructive evil.. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman reprise's there roles as strong as it's been throughout the series.. Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a fair job as the detective and he s a promising actor and the shocking 'Rise' was Marion Cotillard as 'Miranda Tate'..Anne Hatheway as CatWoman was just a sidekick and nothing much performance wise from her We may never see superhero films quite like these again, and that's fine.Nolan had ended on his own terms..If plans arise to reboot the ""Batman"" films a few years from now, I wish you luck. The bar is as high as it could possibly be... Must Watch for all Dark Knight and Nolan and movie lovers..!!"
"one of the most rewarding movies not only for having a realistic life story but also for watching a true hero who gets up on his feet at the end regardless how badly hurt ed he was he's still there

a true hero don't always have to had super powers but rather a Strong willing heart to take the right decisions at the right time & knows when to quit.

never give up

accept the truth about your self

even super heroes must know the feeling of fear sometimes to be true heroes"
"Billionaire Bruce Wayne once said, ""I am moreit's what you do that defines you."" The question is: what defines us all? The fire has risen and that fire has been put out, but not yet though. One thing still remains: Is there a future for the billionaire playboy? Enough about playboys, let's chat about how we got here.

In 2005, we were re-introduced to a boy who fell down a well and we saw what frightened him the most – bats. But he overcame that fear and struck fear into the hearts of those that knew the very existence of fear. Fighting against the mob, Batman took down the biggest crime lords of Gotham City – Carmine Falcone and gave the Scarecrow a taste of his own medicine.

But in 2008, the war was not over, not even by a landslide. As Bruce Wayne was having battles of his own, Batman was posed as a threat to the city and plus a mastermind of theatricality, a brain as the size of a laughing matter, brought a new taste in life – SLAUGHTER WAS THE BEST MEDICINE! The Joker (RIP Heath!), portrayed one of the darkest villains of all time as he brought down upon the city and the new DA Harvey Dent and gave the word ""light"" a new name.

Now we come to 2012, no one expected this to come to a conclusion, we thought we were in it for the long haul. Let's just say it was bittersweet and a whole lot of punches and back breaking. The ultimate villain, Bane, gave violence a new name. A name that was synomous unlike any other. But Bane was not working alone. An arch-enemy came back to finish a job but through someone else. And the black was faded and billionaire was living his life and moving on. But wait something red approaches, something that will fly red colors – is it a red monster, is it a red wagon, no it is a RED ROBIN.

For 8 years, the mastermind of Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathon gave Batman a new look and took the story to a whole new level. Thank you for teaching us that it is what we do that defines us. Christian Bale – you gave us an icon to live up to, you taught us to live for ourselves. Thank you. From Cillian Murphy to Tom Wilkinson to the late Heath Ledger to Aaron Eckhart to Tom Hardy to Anne Hathaway to Marion Cotillard – you guys defined evil. Thank you.

Batman will live in our hearts for years to come."
"I'll start by saying two things: 1. I am a huge Batman fan, in all shapes and sizes (well, except the Joel Schumacher movies); I read the comics, watched the animated series and movies and the live action movies 2. I am intelligent enough to spot plot holes, unrealistic action scenes and 'forced' plot devices.

With those disclaimers in mind, most people who criticize this film would imagine I must hate it. And, yet, it's quite the opposite.

I've just finished watching this for the 3rd time in 2 years. Yes, it's true that, the more often you watch it, the easier it is to spot things that seem off. To look at the details and to start questioning.

But...I really don't care. None of that makes this movie any less special for me. Because, truly, this movie goes to such emotional depths and gets you so in touch with the heart of what it means to be the Batman, that anything else is overshadowed.

The appeal and curse of Batman as a character is that he is human. He suffers and makes mistakes. He can be broken. He doesn't have super strength or the ability to fly. What he does have, beyond the training and the money and being 'the world's greatest detective', is his determination. His unwavering motivation to fight and win for his cause, to make Gotham safe at any cost. That's his superpower - never giving up.

And, on top of that, he has a lot of pain and trauma; the kind that any human being will experience, at some point in their life, that is now out in the open for anyone to sympathize with.

For capturing those things and putting them on screen so beautifully, I am grateful to Mr. Nolan."
"The Dark Knight Rises (2012) is my third best movie. Anne Hathaway was awesome fantastic as Catwoman she portrayed her by comic books the way she was. Michelle Pfeiffer did not do the job by portraying Catwoman by comic books but she did knew how to hit back. Bane played by Tom Hardy was absolutely fantastic terrorist. The Dark Knight Rises is pretty good awesome movie! The third Christopher Nolan film is very bashed and criticized by fan boys of Burton films saying it isn't good as Burton Batman films were. I love The Dark Knight Rises a little much better than Batman Returns, but those 4. films I reviewed will be my four favorite films. Schumacher films suck and they aren't my favorite films.

Anne Hathaway's performance is a worth of watch in this movie. Selina Kyle was written straight from the comic books the way her origins were. I love her in this movie she was well portrayed by Anne Hathaway, the way she was written in a comic books. Christian Bale still lighten us all up in his performance as Batman/Bruce Wayne. Matthew Modine and Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a wonderful performances in their co starring roles. This movie still has a plot holes like Batman dies in the end but he doesn't, Bruce Wayne survives. Alfred disappears magically during half of this movie and he show's up on the end of the movie. Anne Hathaway did a much, much better job than Michelle Pfeiffer did. Bane was a scary villain but still a good comic book portrayed villain the way he was. Tom Hardy was truly great in his performance as the main villain Bane. Seriously I have enjoyed this movie much better as a I did Batman Begins. Still The Dark Knight is the best one of all Batman Films. A good conclusion to end the trilogy.

The Dark Knight Rises is a 2012 British-American epic superhero film directed by Christopher Nolan, who co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Jonathan Nolan, and the story with David S. Goyer. Featuring the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the final installment in Nolan's Batman film trilogy, and the sequel to Batman Begins (2005) and The Dark Knight (2008).

Taking place eight years after the events of ""The Dark Knight"", the film follows Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) once more as he is forced to come out of self-imposed exile when a new evil rises in Gotham. This time around, the Caped Crusader must face off against his most dangerous enemy yet, a ruthless masked crime lord known as Bane (Tom Hardy), who will stop at nothing to bring chaos to the city. He must also deal with the arrival of a mysterious cat burglar named Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), as well as his inner demons. He may have defeated the Joker, but does Batman even stand a chance against Bane?

Eight years after the Joker's reign of anarchy, the Dark Knight is forced to return from his imposed exile to save Gotham City from the brutal guerrilla terrorist Bane with the help of the enigmatic Catwoman.

It's hard to imagine a time when a Christopher Nolan-helmet Batman film wasn't a sure thing. Yes it does.

Warner Bros. Pictures' and Legendary Pictures' ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is the epic conclusion to filmmaker Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy.

Christopher Nolan's concluding vision of the legendary Caped Crusader may just possibly go down as one of the strongest closing chapters to any franchise in modern cinema. Not only is it one of the most entertaining blockbusters of the year, but it also expands upon the Batman saga in a way that keeps you both emotionally and intellectually invested until the very end. With its top-notch performances, breathless score, solidly engrossing storyline, and action-packed set pieces, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" ends the franchise on a satisfying high note, delivering one of the most powerfully engrossing climaxes in recent memory. Anne Hathaway also deserves major props for her portrayal of the cunning Catwoman, who (in my opinion) is even more striking than Michelle Pfeiffer.

Although ""The Dark Knight Rises"" never truly reaches the same groundbreaking heights as its predecessor, I loved every minute of it. The fantastic storytelling, the gritty visuals, the brilliant character development. There's nothing here that isn't worthy of praise in my book. Nolan truly capped off his one-of-a-kind superhero trilogy in a way that no other director could've accomplished. Sure, the narrative can get a bit messy at times, but when compared to everything else the film does right, it hardly matters. I don't recommend this film , because it isn't for everyone. But for any fan of dark, gritty, action-packed filmmaking it is.

R.I.P. to all the victims of the Theater Massacre in Aurora, Colorado. They will be missed.

"The Dark Knight Rises is a 2012 action film directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Oscar-winning Christian Bale as Batman and Tom Hardy as Bane. It was a box office success with total earnings more than $1 billion.

Eight years after the events of The Dark Knight, Batman seems to have retired. But when a new evil force named Bane arrives in Gotham and intends to destroy the city, Batman has to rise again. His allies are few, but he is willing to do whatever it takes to save his city and its people...

One of the best features of the film is its special effects; also why I enjoyed it so much. They were all amazingly good, with the stadium explosion being one of the top movie scenes this year!

What's more, another point I have to mention is the acting; Bale is as convincing as ever, while Hardy is the perfect villain. The rest of the cast, including Anne Hathaway as Catwoman and Gary Oldman as Comissioner Gordon remains at its finest.

All in all, I found the film more enjoyable than any other this year. So, don't waste time-grab your popcorn, your friends and watch it. In my opinion though, you should already have done so!"
"If you've had enough of Batmen because of the likes of Val Kilmer and George Clooney, then you haven't enjoyed Christian Bale in director Christopher Nolan's trilogy of Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, and now the superior Dark Knight Rises. Bale brings the anguish and triumph of a real human being who suffers and overcomes his sorrows to fight the forces of evil—the American way.

While that way is too often by way of violence in movies, this iteration, where Bruce Wayne returns from self-exile to fight the fearful Bane (Tom Hardy), is more often punctuated by intelligence (in weapon designs and mostly in strategy). In fact, the violence is frequently mundane fist fighting, almost as if to emphasize guile over missile. Sadly, the two battles between Batman and Bane are so dull that I longed for CGI to elevate the sophistication. Body blows hardly satisfy in this high-tech world.

Characteristic of Nolan, the bad guys are memorable and formidable: Bane has a mask to remind us of Darth Vader with his power and darkness, actually coming from a pit of darkness as if from some Poe-like tale of terror; Catwoman (Anne Hathaway) is witty, slippery, and mercurial while sporting a figure Hathaway must have worked hard to fashion; and the surprise villain, well, is more vicious than the others because of the ultimate disguise (not to be disclosed here for fear of my being thrown into the naughty-critic pit).

Then there's Alfred (Michael Caine), Bruce Wayne's faithful servant, whose soul is almost as tortured as Wayne's. Caine is called on to shed a few tears, which are more believable than all the CGI machines. I wouldn't be surprised if Caine gains an Oscar nomination for supporting role (he won two Oscars already). As for Joseph Gordon-Levitt's cop, John Blake, he is subtly effective in gaining our sympathy so that he is guaranteed to return in the next Batman production.

I am unusually effusive about the acting because it is so good, but I should not forget that themes are always prominent in this series. Global financial failure, loyalties, and warfare; and, of course, the ambiguity of human beings, symbolized by masks, keep this comic-book thriller from sinking in its own weight of explosions and bombast.

The Amazing Spider-Man impressed me a few weeks ago because it caught squarely the young person's challenges of self-centered arrogance and growing maturity thorough responsibility. Now The Dark Knight Rises shows the inner struggles of an adult hero racked with doubt, more inclined to forsake responsibility than to save humanity. As for the Avengers, it now looks like a showcase for costumes at a Comic-Con convention.

Nolan and Bale have caught the angst of adults everywhere who, when confronted with financial ruin or the need to defend their turf from alien forces, may bail out rather than face down the evils. Despite the questionably-long 164 minutes, the artists of this film have kept every minute interesting, fast-paced, and highly useful to develop a pride of heroes who should keep us entertained for at least next decade."
"I went to see the Dark Knight Rises last week and I have to say I was impressed. Story-wise it's a lot better than it's predecessors. The plot is coherent and has several interesting twists along the way that I won't spoil for you here. My only complaint is that it is a bit heavy going at some points. 3 hours is a long time, and I wouldn't go so far as to say boring, but it definitely takes a while to pick up the pace. However once it does you are in for a thrill ride.

Nolan did a fantastic job with the Characters, from the troubled Bruce Wayne/Batman to Catwoman to the antagonist Bane, as well as secondary characters such as Alfred and Gordon, they are all fleshed out beautifully and are very believable in respect to the source material. Supplemented by superb acting by the all star cast, I have no complaints here.

The direction is fantastic. As I said above, it takes a while to pick up, but it never ever get's boring. As soon as you start to think that, something happens that pulls you right back in. Nolan deserves to be commended for this. The action scenes are brilliantly done, the special effects are great, Hans Zimmer's score is, as always, superb, the editing and cinematography are crisp. There really is not much to complain about here.

In my personal opinion it is the best installment in the Nolan trilogy, and if you haven't seen it yet I can only recommend you do so as soon as possible."
"Didn't think this film lived up to the hype surrounding it. It was good, don't get me wrong but it didn't compare with the Dark Knight. Seemed too full of action and definitely violence, which obscured the story somewhat.However Christian Bale played a blinder again and he has definitely made the role his and his alone. Nobody would be able to compare to him. The ending was again a bit rushed and didn't really come as any surprise, and again this let down the overall film. Sets up another series, which would have to be exceptional to compare. But overall a let down and not a fitting end to this franchise. Let's hope the Man Of Steel (another DC offering) will strengthen the comic lines takings as the Green Lantern certainly didn't. Sorry, the Avengers will be the box office topper this year!"
"A mediocre comic book film. While decent at times, there are too many patches of poor dialog the bring out poor performances from the actors. While Bruce Wayne is reluctant to put back on the bat suit, Bale seems equally reluctant to put on his Bruce Wayne suit. His performance is entirely uninteresting and he never seems to recover any fire. 

Hathaway does a fair job, but she and Bale lack chemistry. A scene with Levitt is so poorly written and performed it is painful to watch. 

Bane is never menacing. It sounds like he is impersonating Jeremy Irons from Die Hard 3. He also does this ridiculous head shake during his speech, as if to insure the audience that he is speaking. 

The tie in to A Tale of Two Cities is obvious and ham fisted.  There is so little build up to the behavior the citizens quickly adopt that  it just fails to make itself plausible. While the personal sacrifice from A Tale of Two Cities makes that story powerful, the cop out in this film weakens the whole story.  

Some of the action scenes are pretty good. Some are just ridiculous. Batman always seems like some guy in a suit who is fighting a creepy guy with a mask. 

Overall this movie just fails to ever become compelling."
"You just don't watch a Nolan movie. You experience it. Something happens inside you after you're done watching any of his movies.

The Dark Knight Rises is not just a movie, its a baggage of expectations, its a sequel to The Dark Knight, it has been directed by Chris Nolan, it has the Batman and people have already started with their assumptions and speculations.

Does the movie survive all this?

Yes. Definitely yes.

Batman Begins dealt with fear. The Dark Knight dealt with chaos. The Dark Knight Rises deals with pain.

Eight years have been passed since the demise of Harvey Dent. Batman had hung up the boots and started blaming himself for Harvey's Death and everything. With all the injuries he had sustained while fighting under that bat suit and the depression, he is no longer the Bruce Wayne Gotham knows. People have been questioning his sanity. Wayne empire is declining.

In comes Bane. The dark, brutal, masked and monolithic beast who almost destroys Wayne enterprises to seek Batman.

Selina Kyle, a female burglar who teases Bruce Wayne with her attitude and activities.

As a result, Batman is forced to come back. What follows is the series of events that not only blow your mind away but cast a magical spell to last the full life time.

There are a several new players that have been introduced in the film, such as Wayne's love interest and the new age cop John Blake who does the job of being the good side kick of Gordon and plays in an important role in convincing Bruce Wayne to be back as the caped crusader to protect Gotham one last time from the terror of Bane and army.

So is The Dark Knight Rises better than The Dark Knight? If you were one of those fans who prefer Batman Begins to TDK then you'll find much to love about TDKR. And if you weren't then no Batman film will ever match TDK for you.

As both Batman and Bruce Wayne, Christian Bale's work here is master- class, and he gives the character such an inescapable melancholy – a certain perseverance in the face of absolute resignation to his fate – that he becomes a more tragic figure than ever. That said, he's aided enormously by a never-better Michael Caine, who turns with hope and palpable love what might otherwise be expository dialogue into searing, supportive criticisms of Wayne's self-destruction.

On the other hand, after being marketed as heir to the Joker in ""The Dark Knight,"" Tom Hardy's Bane is a different sort of villain – a focused and more ideologically-developed version of Heath Ledger's Joker – but one with equally ruthless charm.

While she doesn't quite steal the show as Heath Ledger's Joker did, Hathaway's Catwoman is a magnetic presence whenever she's on screen and she has great chemistry with Bale. Selina may be the proverbial good bad girl, the thief with a heart of gold, but Hathaway imbues her with a wounded spirit and a survivor's edge that makes her feel genuine and sympathetic even when she's being naughty.

That being said, the acts of good old Gary Oldman and the power house Joseph Gordon Levitt cannot be ignored.

Christopher Nolan is in peak time of his life. Whatever he is touching is turning into gold. He has taken The Batman series to a level which no one in thousand years can reach. The action scenes, the rise and the fall of all the characters along with the climax are just the pieces of the puzzle, which in the end you feel was taking shape since the day Batman Begins released. The first hour ties all the loose ends the first two movies left behind and the climax is so apt that you leave the theater feeling contended and satisfied.

We may never see superhero films quite like these again, and that's fine. Nolan had something special to say with his time in the trenches, and he's ended on his own terms.

I wonder which series Nolan decides to reboot next!"
"Firstly I will say that I loved Batman Begins. Then Christopher Nolan gave us The Dark Knight and I felt it was on a whole other level than Batman Begins. I went into the cinema to The Dark Knight Rises on the day of release with high expectations. These were blown away! I even went to see it at the cinema again and I've never done that before! (I understand other people saw it many more times but still a first for me)

The acting was absolutely superb! Christian Bale was at his very best playing Bruce Wayne/Batman. Michael Caine was brilliant as Alfred despite his short screen time and I feel the performance was Oscar nomination worthy. Anne Hathaway was a better Catwoman than I could have imagined. Joseph Gordon Levitt was really good as Blake. Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman were good as always playing Gordon and Fox. Marion Cotillard was good as Miranda as well. Finally Tom Hardy as Bane. I thought this was good casting from the start but I never imagined something quite this good! Tom Hardy stole the show for me just like Heath Ledger did in The Dark Knight. Bane is one of my favourite baddies of all time now and while it wasn't quite as good as The Joker, it was as close as it was ever going to come. Tom Hardy is worthy of an Oscar nom for his portrayal of Bane especially since he was restricted with the mask and had to convey emotions through eyes, voice and body language. There were a few moments where I couldn't understand his voice but sometimes it just took a few extra seconds to absorb it and his voice sounds too awesome to care anyway.

Wally Pfisters cinematography was incredible once again and I think I see another Oscar nomination for him.

Hans Zimmer's score was his greatest yet in my opinion and it really added to the emotional depth of the film and just got you into the film right from the start. Dare I say it another Oscar nomination?

Finally Christopher Nolan's Direction was incredible as always and I truly believe this to be his finest creation to date and he must get an Oscar nomination if not his first win, he definitely deserves it.

Overall this film was outstanding, one of the greatest films ever made,the finest of Nolan's Batman trilogy and the best superhero movie of all time. An Oscar nomination is deserved and I think any other film coming out this year will struggle to beat it."
"Is it a perfect film? No. It is a great blockbuster? Yes, it is. Tonally, The Dark Knight Rises rises above its predecessor in the trilogy, because it manages to balance the grounded in realism and comic book aspects into a tonally coherent work. In fact, though it still attempts to ground itself in reality, this is the most operatic and most bombastic of the Batman films. And, dear lord, does operatic work with the superhero genre. After all, at its true core, Batman, and the superhero genre, is inherently a ridiculous concept. I loved the ridiculous voice of Bane and Michael Cain's constant hamming it up, crying speeches.

In recent years, the JJ Abraham's school of film-making has gained currency. The film moving so fact to one scene to the next that the audience barely has time to register the illogical steps taken by the characters. This is evident in the 2009, Star Trek film. While Nolan does this, he does it with so much more panache that it transcends the narrative, editing weaknesses associated with this modern form of film- making. The Dark Knight Rises is a pure cinematic experience. It is a film that needs It is a film that needs to be experience in the big screen. Even the hand to hand fighting sequences-- an area that Christopher Nolan has struggled with in the past -- are exemplary; they are reminiscent of the slow light saber fights in the Old Trilogy.

The biggest problem with the film is that it does not developed the relationship between Marion Colitard's character and Bruce Wayne well enough; it feels too force. Another major problem with the film is the Howard Hughes segment, it which it is they only portion of the film that drags."
"First of all, the Dark Knight Rises in the concluding and final chapter in the critically acclaimed Christopher Nolan (Director) Dark knight Trilogy, and due to it being the predecessor to 2008's The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises was already overwhelmed with especially high expectations. However did it meet those expectations?

(Spoilers!)The Dark Knight Rises opens with an overwhelming plane aerial action sequence, an the introduction of Tom Hardy's representation of the character of Bane. Tom hardy's performance as Bane is constantly stimulating, both visually and mentally, possibly as stimulating as Heath ledger's representation of the Joker in The Dark Knight, however I do believe that Hardy's performance is heavily tainted by the way in which the character of Bane was ""removed"" from the film, during the final act of the film. Among the incredible five star performances of the cast from Anne Hathaway in her fitting performance as Catwoman to the emotional performance of Morgan Freeman, the acting was a driving force in the film's outstanding quality. The intense, emotional performances were essential to the film's sharp writing, great pacing throughout the story. Christopher Nolan's incredible flashback technique used to compose an incredible plot twist during the final act of the Film. It has been constantly noted that the film has an extensive amount of plot holes, however after analyzing the story, I do believe that many of the plot holes mentioned are very pedantic methods used by fans of other blockbusters such as The Avengers, to better their personal opinions, rather than explaining what they enjoyed about their own personal favorite, they would rather slander and taint The Dark Knight Rises.

However the film does have some relevant plot holes, which could have been resolved by additional footage, such as a director's cut or a three and a half hour edition of the film, I would have also been satisfied with a two part version of the film in which each part was two hours, or more in length. The film's combination of ""the chase"",and the ""the ticking time bomb"", during the final action sequence was an incredibly powerful sequence which kept me heavily invested in the outcome of the story, which climaxed with the most emotionally gripping moment in comic book film history, in my opinion. The supposed death of the Batman in the nuclear explosion, later denied by his alive appearance as Bruce Wayne, was a symbolic way to express how the death of Batman, allowed Bruce Wayne to Truly ""live"", while also leaving you wondering how he did it? Bruce Wayne's time in the underground prison was incredibly reminiscent of Batman Begins, as Bruce Wayne was forced re build his broken psyche, and truly become the Batman, physically and mentally; this also defined Bane to be both the greatest test for Batman mentally and physically but also the most important factor in Bruce becoming a truly righteous hero that Gotham deserves. And the final gift from Christopher Nolan the audience, was Joseph Gordon Levitt becoming the symbol of hope for Gotham as Wayne did in Batman Begins, leaving the audience understanding that the Batman is immortal in a metaphorical way, anyone with the will to do so can be Batman, in Nolan's cleverly and emotionally investing world. The Dark Knight Rises was a satisfying ending chapter to a greatly weaved masterpiece of a trilogy from start to finish. I would give The Dark Knight Rises 9.5/10, or an A+."
"I loved the Dark Knight. I loved its complexities, I loved its performances and I loved its direction. It was not only a great superhero film but a great film in general. Did they exactly need a conclusion to Batman's story? That's really not for me to decide, but they did it and in my opinion it ended in the best possible way. Not the best way, but the best possible way. This is an excellent film, it is excellent because it demonstrates everything that made the Dark Knight Trilogy complex, and because of Nolan's direction it made it even better. Christian Bale gives a fine performance as Batman, the theatrical voice is still there, but it's toned down. I could barely recognize Tom Hardy as Bane, the voice is a little much but he still does good nevertheless. I really don't get all the hate for Anne Hathaway, she's a good actress, regardless of what her ambitions might be, she did good in Les Miz but did well here. Joseph Gordon- Levitt did good as usual, and Gary Oldman Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman can do this in their sleep. The Dark Knight was what it was because it had a realism to it, this could definitely happen in real life, in regards to the Joker. The realism fades when Bane comes along but that's not a bad thing if the story is told well (and it is). If you've seen the Dark Knight, go see this, and if you're looking for a great movie go see this."
"When I saw the dark knight rises, I expected a villain who would be able to stand up to the acting which Heath Ledger had given in the dark knight. But I was disappointed with Bane's character even though Tom Hardy tried his best it didn't have the charm which the other two villains in the prequels had... Marion Cotillard didn't do what deserved of her role.. Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine had no new form or structure even after 8 years, people change with time.. and u need to show at least some change in their character.... The only people who showed justice to their roles were Anne Hathaway as catwomen and Christian Bale.... The story was nothing exceptional. But I say to the people don't expect anything like the The Dark Knight... Just an ordinary story, with an ordinary villain with no character devlopment like the Joker or Ra al gul... And a batman who can and at no point feels weaker in courage than then villain... Overall I give it a 6 for just Anne Hathaway and Christian Bale's performance with the direction of Nolan."
"""You are in for a show tonight!"" The dark knight rises one last time to save Gotham. This movie portrays batman at his most fragile self. Problems are everywhere while solutions in the abyss. Bruce is down with grief, Wayne empire is at all time low, Bane and his gang is taking over the city brick by brick. Bruce is faced with a choice to let Gotham die or rise to give some hope to its citizens who are interested in only one thing that they do best when threatened: own survival.

This movie is a perfect blend of, pain, struggle, sadness, suspense, action, loss, chaos, triumph, powerful lines, a number of great performances and above all a very good story.

Out of so many good ones if I need to choose a single stand out performance it would be Christian Bale, he has come a long way. This movie gave him a real chance to show what he is capable of as Bruce Wayne. Then comes Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, reviewing their performance would be like holding a candle to the sun so I won't. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ann Hathaway were perfect for their parts, I was a little doubtful of Hathaway but she managed to steal the frames a good number of times. While I missed a mind blowing performance like Heath, Tom Hardy as Bane managed to deliver a handful of terrifying moments and last but not the least what a great music.

A tiny issue I had was that first half took a little while to come to speed, but I guess it was necessary to build the story and to tie up the loose ends from last two parts.

No amount of words would be enough to praise Christopher Nolan for giving us a stellar finale.

My Rating: 9/10"
"I don't normally review movies unless I feel compelled to do so. In this case, I feel I was duped into expecting a very good movie. Isn't that what I should have expected with an 8.5/10 rating?

I won't get into the details, they're well-documented throughout these reviews. And I won't detail the nonsense that is considered a plot for those that may not have had the displeasure of viewing this movie. There are so many times that I was left shaking my head that I sustained a neck injury just watching this.

I like the idea of Bane as a physically powerful foe, I like Anne Hathaway as Catwoman (although her character has serious flaws) and the veterans do their normal commendable job attempting to bring stability to this disaster.

I gave it a 3 because I like Batman and I still want to like him. I will put this movie out of my mind so that I continue to like him."
"The plot is a total nonsense from the beginning to the end. They don't even try to make it believable. I know it's a super hero movie, we're not in the real world, but still. I felt this movie was an insult to the public. It's like saying you don't understand anything of what is happening in the world around you, why would you care to understand what is going on in the movie? We end up with a very childish plot where whatever you want to happen just happens with magic. A nuclear reactor turned into a nuclear bomb with a screwdriver in 2 minutes in a garage, a broken spine healed with a rope and 3 push ups, it's all like this. Just boring and lazy. Even the fights are lame. Bane and Batman are supposed to be the 2 best fighters in the world but they fight like a couple of drunk cowboys. Jackie Chan would kick their butt in no time. Can't believe it's rated 8.7 today."
"I wanted to write ""just see it,"" but IMDb requires 10 lines, so here goes nothing. There's something in this film for everyone, especially Batman fans. That doesn't mean Chris Nolan and team tried to please everyone -- if you've seen any of his films, you know he's got too much integrity and cinematic love for that. There's romance, real drama and feeling, in contrast to the first two movies. Action fans will dig it, wingnut tech-heads will dig it. There's even a hint of the supernatural in this movie. War movie fans will dig it. I think it's fair to say that most Chris Nolan fans will dig it too. I can't even fault the film for it's moment of garbled dialogue, because those moment just fuel my desire to see this movie again. Just see it."
"Nolan has created a Pulp Masterpiece. With Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, Nolan set out to get Batman back to his gritty roots. With Rises, Nolan slowly backs out of the grittiness and enters a pulpier realm. A Bondian realm that begins with a mid-air high-jacking. Has a villain that wears a mask 99% of the film. Batman and Catwoman fighting side by side only to be stopped by gunfire from henchmen so incompetent they can only hit their own comrades rather than hitting their intended targets. And of course a nuclear bomb countdown. Nolan clearly has a love for James Bond films (as he also showed with Inception). As a fellow Bond aficionado, I really appreciate this, and it only adds to my overall enjoyment of the film. Superhero movies generally follow a particular formula. I could predict the plot beats of most of the recent Marvel films (this is not a complaint of Marvel's Cinematic Universe, just an observation). The point is that this film (as its predecessor did) threw me more surprises than most films of this genre typically do. And my expectations were blown away. TDKR has a very intricate structure, and for being 165 minutes long, the movie flies by at a nice pace.

Nolan's film has the feeling of a Coppola-sized epic from the 1970s, with its plot complexity, large cast of characters, intricate dialogue scenes with equal helpings of pain and tragedy. Many scenes in the film are shot in an orange/sepia tone that reminds me of The Godfather Part II. Tom Hardy's Bane is a mythical, Kurtz-like antagonist. The film has subtext and some political satire, one can interpret that how they will.

""The Dark Knight Rises"" could very well be the most polarizing film of Nolan's career thus far, hopefully the debate will continue."
"Wow this brilliant way of ending the trilogy makes me feel that this is just the beginning. I would call the same casting on and on for more adventure.

Bane is not my favorite character by far (really not interesting, just a tough guy) but all participate intensely and have a role and feed the story. The casting is incredible: Batman Begins + Inception + Anne Hathaway (she's such a complete and lovable actress and person)

I just got the 2 DVD collector edition in Switzerland yesterday. I definitely recommend watching the bonus features, they explain a lot about the concept behind this movie and the connection with the beginning of the story.

An amazing production, screenplay, performance !

And yet: The whole experience was so different than on big screen. ""Duh"" you might say and still... let me explain myself:

I recognized that some parts are only effective if you watched the film only once. This doesn't necessarily happen with other masterpieces I can watch on an on.

When I watched all the interesting bonus features on the second DVD, I started noticing that from many multiple shots (shots filmed from many angles at the same time) the choice of those shots used for the movie weren't the clearest, or the most astonishing. So may things are finally not so clearly seen in the movie. There were many other successful angles that could have been used more effectively.

Music soundtrack ? Hans Zimmer did a nice job but I would have preferred James Newton Howard.

The fights weren't that clever, too tough and bulky, not necessary, no intelligence around them, plain fist. Not my port of call.

Thank you Christopher Nolan for being clever enough to participate in the cinema industry and still deliver ART.

Definitely a realistic, surprising and enjoyable film

Thanks to all reviews and commentaries.

"THE BEST.

THE GREATEST.

THE ULTIMATE EXPERIENCE.

THE DEFINITION OF AN ENTIRE GENERATION.

Every once in a while, there's that one trilogy that would change the landscape of the film industry forever and would define an entire generation.

There was George Lucas' Star Wars trilogy, which took sci-fi movies to a whole new level (I wasn't born that time but I'm aware of the legacy of course).

Then decades later, it was Peter Jackson's Lord Of The Rings trilogy which raised the bar in fantasy epics so high that even now could never be reached much less equaled (yes, Harry Potter and Game Of Thrones are baby stuff compared to the grandeur LOTR).

And now, Christoper Nolan's The Dark Knight trilogy.

Before, comicbook / superhero movies were too campy, too light-hearted and in every bit sense of the word, unrealistic. Characters were over the top, stories were cliché and predictable, no risk factors and just dull and there's no ""holy **** did you see that?!"" stuff. It's as if they weren't serious efforts, like, studio guys would just say ""hey since everybody's doing it, let's do it!"". Results vary but mostly mediocre stuff and below. Simply, you don't get emotionally-attached to them, which is THE POINT of watching movies.

Enter the Nolan-era of comicbook / superhero movies.

Quite literally, Nolan turned the genre upside-down, flip it and then some. Nolan CHANGED THE GAME and took it to uncharted levels by introducing never before seen elements such as dark tones and themes, gripping plots and scripts, masterclass musical scores, relatable characters which comprises of genuine heroes and likable villains, above all, pulse-pounding moments that would make your jaw drop countless times and say ""HOLY ****! HOLY ****! HOLY ****!!!"". It's a genuine effort and love of the craft that you can see and feel as much as Lucas to Star Wars and Jackson to LOTR.

It started with Batman Begins almost 7 years ago in 2005, continued 3 years later with The Dark Knight and now finally capped off with the monumental conclusion The Dark Knight Rises in 2012 as the motion picture event of the year. The trilogy redefined Batman and Bruce Wayne and everything we know in Gotham City. Right off Batman Begins' origin story, to the emotional torture core of The Dark Knight and to pain, suffering and triumph of The Dark Knight Rises, the legend of The Caped Crusader was flawless and the acting of the cast was impeccable all throughout.

Of course, the guy that's got to be Batman has got to really be THE GUY, and Christian Bale not only meet expectations, he exceeded them in every step of the way.

Bale is the perfect Batman, just was the late great Christopher Reeve was as Superman. I mean, nobody could replicate that connection from Reeve and Superman for decades, maybe ever (though DC and Warner Bros. would try again with Henry Cavill in Man Of Steel, we'll see). Same thing can be said to Spider-Man's Tobey Maguire, that Facebook guy is awful compared to him. As well as Robert Downey Jr. in Iron Man. And I believe the case is the same for Bale; it's gonna be LONG, LONG TIME until somebody could match, much less surpass him as Batman. Most likely, never. In a nutshell, we felt for Batman because of Bale.

And same thing could be said with Nolan's Batrilogy. Right from the opening scenes of Begins and as the credits roll of TDKR, it was a ride like no other comicbook / superhero movie has done ever before. This is the kind of stuff we'd tell our children and grandchildren that defined our generation, that we'll make them watch these things years from now and tell them experiences waiting in line outside theaters and watching DVDs and Blu-rays at midnight, like our parents now do. I mean, I'm not even a comics guy (I don't read any paper stuff honestly), nor a Batman fan or fan of any comicbook or superhero, but when Nolan's trilogy came, I became one. That to me, is something EXTRAORDINARY very few in one's life could experience.

Obviously, Star Wars has it fair share of haters, so does LOTR, so why should we be surprised by the Nolan haters. These guys would scream ""oh that's boring I've seen that before!"" or ""that's predictable I knew it!"" or ""Avengers is the best STFU GTFO LOL LMAO!"" or whatever these guys could come up it. They're clueless anyway. Smart viewers know what's really up.

REMEMBER: These kind of critics are those who failed at art and literature and just about anything and everything in life. And when you're at the top, there'll always be those who'd want to pull you down. Nolan and his Batman is at top, that's why.

Huge props and thanks to Nolan and Bale, to Liam Neeson, to the late great Heath Ledger (I'd almost forget to say that his portrayal of The Joker is in the league of Darth Vader as the greatest villains ever), to Tom Hardy, to Michael Caine, to Gary Oldman, to Morgan Freeman and just about every actor and crew that participated in bringing Batman to life LIKE NO OTHER.

Take a bow ladies and gentlemen."
"Christopher Nolan's ambitious Batman trilogy has come to a close with perhaps one of the greatest superhero films ever made. Both Batman Begins and the Dark Knight were cinematic masterpieces and are complimented nicely with this film, The Dark Knight Rises. Being the longest film in the series, it has incredible set pieces, a sinister villain, excellent acting, a loud and bombastic score by Hans Zimmer, and lots of emotional depth.

Nolan's film takes place eight years after the events of the Dark Knight and Bruce Wayne has moved into seclusion. Regarding Gotham, crime has been suppressed with the Dent laws, but now a new force led by the notorious Bane is threatening to take control over Gotham. So is it time for Bruce to give his cowl and cape another shot?

This film has a plethora of characters so events may be confusing at time(which it wasn't for me.) Christian Bale as always is near perfect as Batman and he adds some emotional depth to his eccentricity. Michael Caine has a bigger role here and has some of the biggest, most emotion-filled dialogue of the film. While different in stature from the Joker, Tom Hardy makes a great Bane and reminds me greatly of Hannibal. Both Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman return and are amazing. I didn't think Anne Hathaway as Catwoman would be effective, but I was proved wrong. Joseph Gordon-Levitt brings his talent as well as a few surprises to the film.

Overall, this is an amazing ending to the greatest superhero trilogy. Some of the set pieces are just amazing and incredible to watch. The football stadium, the opening sequence with the airplanes, and the takeover of the stock exchange were just a few of my favorite sequences. But nothing competes with that amazing, action-packed finale. Some people may not like the ending at all, but I think it's a fair way to end the film. It's unfortunate that the movie shooting in Colorado overshadowed this film, but I want to point out movie violence is not the cause for real-life violence and we shouldn't abandon the theaters because of this heinous act. This film is amazing and I'm pretty sad that the trilogy is over. I rate this film 10/10."
"Excellent writing, excellent acting, excellent directing, etc. The Dark Knight Rises represents Christopher Nolan at his most epic cinematic state. TDKR is more ambitious than the previous two films and takes greater risks which ultimately pay off. although not quite as immersive as The Dark Knight, TDKR is more emotionally wrenching, provides more twists and operates on a much grander scale.

Despite the large new cast, Christopher Nolan manages to breathe life into each character, even the ones so ordinary as Joseph Gorden Levitt's typical cop. He also manages to tie all events in the move to a brilliant thematic climax that will wow just about everyone.

Overall, the movie is incredible and although it doesn't quite meet the standards set by The Dark Knight, it still manages to inspire immense awe from its audience."
"'The Dark Knight Rises' isn't Epic. But its impressive nonetheless. Christopher Nolan delivers a film worth watching, however, he doesn't quiet top himself in here. Its an entertainer!

'The Dark Knight Rises' Synopsis: Eight years on, a new terrorist leader, Bane, overwhelms Gotham's finest, and the Dark Knight resurfaces to protect a city that has branded him an enemy.

'The Dark Knight Rises' is overtly long & dragging. Christopher Nolan & Jonathan Nolan's Screenplay is excellent in parts, but at times, it comes across as dragging & long. For example, the bad-guy, Bane, played by Tom Hardy, why does he hate Gotham so much & why he's being so god-damn heartless. There is proper reason, yet he's creating a chaos. Another flaw, lies in its running time. 168 minutes seems a bit too stretched. Christopher Nolan's Direction is extremely competent. Cinematography is grand. Editing & Art Design, are spectacular. Action-Sequences are huge.

Performance-Wise: Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman, shines. The Oscar-Winning Actor is so believable & natural in his part. Tom Hardy as Bane, is a big letdown. Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle, is quite good. Michael Caine as Alfred, is given the backseat, while Gary Oldman as James Gordon & New-Entry Joseph Gordon-Levitt as John Blake, are terrific. Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate, has a delicious role. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, is dignified.

On the whole, 'The Dark Knight Rises' is an impressive superhero flick, but it isn't half as good as its predecessor 'The Dark Knight'."
"I am a person that just do not believe in a perfect rating, but this movie definitely deserves a full credit. I mean whats not perfect in it? the acting , the music, the story , the action, everything was made in the most perfect way ever and I Like it. I saw this movie may be 3 times now and I believe it is very difficult to do such great work again.

I will never forget the first time i saw it in the movies and the theater was full and at the end of it everyone started applauding like i never saw in my entire life. If for any reason you hadn't seen this movie then you should. You will just love it."
"The Dark Knight Rises Review 3/5

The expectations were high for this film given that it was a direct follow up to The Dark Knight. With a great storyline, memorable characters, groundbreaking action scenes and a perfect performance by Heath Ledger it was easily one of the best comic book adaptations to date. But even that film had its flaws but not as much as this one. At the time of its release a lot of the critics received backlash and even death threats from the rabid fans. The fans were even worse than the Star Wars fans. Anyway The Dark Knight Rises is far from perfect but it does have some enjoyable moments throughout.

Eight years have past since the events of The Dark Knight. Bruce Wayne is retired living his life in isolation, The Joker is locked away and Gotham City's crime rate is at an all time low. But the masked villainous Bane and his army are lurking in the sewers and he has a plan. After hearing about Commissioner Gordon being hospitalised and encountering a mysterious cat burglar Bruce Wayne decides to come back out of retirement. It's a real crowd pleaser when he comes back as Batman but he has to go toe to toe with his toughest opponent yet. He's not as fast as he used to be however that is what gives the film it's edge, we can finally root for Bruce Wayne because he is in a vulnerable state here. Bane is sort of like a 60s Bond villain taking the city hostage threatening to blow it up if anyone leaves.

The opening plane hijack sequence is breathtaking and like the majority of the action sequences it was shot in IMAX using practical effects. From miniatures to daring stunts we see real stuntmen hang off of the dangling plane fuselage. The overall action scenes are intense accompanied by an epic music score by returning composer Hans Zimmer. Although some of them suffer from bad editing they are still enjoyable and look spectacular. It's best to watch it with surround sound speakers as the sound effects make the experience more immersive from Banes heavy breathing, the bone crunching punch ups to the extremely loud gunshots and explosions. It's the most action packed of the trilogy but it suffers from a thin plot.

Christopher Nolan does a fine job directing the film but not much can be said about his screenplay. Unfortunately it's his worst writing yet making this the most implausible chapter. It's full of so many character storylines and it just gets confusing. There are a lot of things that make little to no sense. There isn't much logic to many of the scenes, there are some obvious twists throughout and a lot of things go by unexplained. Using flashbacks it harps back to previous plot lines and characters in an attempt to make it feel more connected to those films. On top of all that it runs at nearly 3 hours which is just too long considering how half baked the plot is.

Aside from all of this Christian Bale gives his best performance as a more weary broken Bruce Wayne. Tom Hardy is really good in the role of Bane and every time he's on screen he is physically imposing, very intimidating and he has some great lines of dialogue. Michael Caine is only in it briefly but he gives an emotional nuanced performance as family butler Alfred. Joseph Gordon Levitt and Anne Hathaway both do serviceable jobs - However with such a big cast the film didn't really need them, they are just there for fan service and to be honest their story arcs are not very interesting. But that being said Hathaways cat suit has a cool realistic look to it which fits well within the continuity of the Nolan franchise. That's one thing you can give them credit for is they make these films as grounded in reality as possible. But with outlandish characters like Bane and Catwoman there are a lot of things they have to compromise like Selina Kyle/Catwomans backstory. She wasn't resurrected by cats like the comics, she is simply just a woman who is very good at sneaking about. Bane isn't a raging hulk who gets pumped on steroid juice he's just a conflicted man who has been through some bad stuff. Overall it's a thourouly enjoyable film but it's let down by lazy writing full and plot-holes."
"This is one of my favorite bad movies ever. So many things in it don't make any sense. It's awfully written and the fact that this movie has an 8.4 shows that many people don't have a single braincell.

FBI guys in plane instead of shooting attackers outside plane decide to start punching their tied-down prisoners so the movie can happen.

Who are Bane's armed men in the first place and why do they blindly follow him?

Gotham sends the entirety of Gotham's cops (3,000 in a city of 12 million compared to New York's 40,000 cops in a city of 8 million) into the sewers instead of smaller teams of Swat troopers or national guard and now they're trapped? And can't they just climb out of the manholes or is Bane's men guarding every manhole in the city?

The cops charge Bane's men armed with machine guns and hardly any of the cops die and the next scene everyone is in a fist-fight?

Why doesn't Bane detonate the bomb immediately? Why wait 6 months? Literally no reason because he intends to just blow it up regardless.

Awful ending twist with Talia Al'Ghul that means nothing to anyone and leads to an unintentionally hilarious death scene.

Batman's broken back fixed by a rope and a punch to it.

All in all, not good."
"The Matrix, Spiderman and Pirates Of The Caribbean, all critically acclaimed and all bringing in a satisfying box office return. Their reputation inspiring movie bosses to produce sequel, which all ended up disappointing... Will The Epic 'Dark Knight' trilogy be reduced to the same fate... The world waited with baited breath.

The Dark Knight Rises, the third and final installment of Christopher Nolan's comic book saga lived up to it's name to rise above other movie trilogies and soar to the thematic and stylistic heights of its predecessors.

In the mid 1990s' the reputation of Warner Bros. Batman franchise was at an all time low with Batman & Robin producing some of the cheesiest one liners in cinema history (such as Mr Freezes ""Ice to see you!"").

In 2005 Nolan resurrected the Caped Crusader in with the critically praised 'Batman Begins'', the grittier and darker origin story of how Bruce Wayne became to be a moonlight masked vigilante standing up against injustice in the city of Gotham. Helped with solid performances from Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes and Cillian Murphy a sequel was inevitable.

In 2008, Nolan and his team returned for the follow-up. The Dark Knight, just as captivating and ingenious as the first but with one exceptional difference. Heath Ledgers Joker, stole the show (and Academy Award) as he bought Gotham City to it's knees by turning Gothams White Knight (DA Harvey Dent) on to a grief driven killing spree that destroys everything that Harvey and Batman had fought so hard to stop.

In The Dark Knight Rises, the story has progressed eight years. Batman has taken blame for Harvey Dents murders and left Gotham to fend for itself. Bruce Wayne is holed up in a rebuilt Wayne Manor and is the most adrift we've seen the character on screen, weakened and even going grey he is considering a return to action against taking a new path. Bruce and Alfred (Michael Caine) debate Batman's future in tense and tender exchanges, that will tug your heart. You're hooked, and the fighting hasn't even started.

In a scene James Bond would kill for, a CIA aircraft transporting terrorists is sensationally hijacked in midair by Bane (Tom Hardy), an intimidating hulk whose nose and mouth are encumbered by a tubular, grill-like metal mask which gives his voice an artificial quality similar to that of Darth Vader. What Bane is up to is not entirely clear, but it can't be good.

Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), A spirited Cat burglar tries to get Bruce Wayne/Batman back into the limelight. But an attempted kidnapping of Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) and a brazen attack on the Stock Exchange from Bane is what catches the Bats attention, the latter catastrophe having the double effect of bankrupting Bruce Wayne.

Commandeering the city's sewers with his fellow mercenaries, Bane begins his first onslaught on the caped crusader which will leave you gasping in disbelief. If the Theme behind Batman Begins was fear and the Dark Knight is chaos then the theme behind this movie is clear Pain! The remaining 90 minutes will keep you on the edge of your seat, the pinnacle moment when Bane destroys well everything, including a masterfully created scene that we've already seen in the trailers when Gotham's Football stadium implodes to the earthy. Depths below.

The real world threats of terrorism, political anarchy and economic instability make The Dark Knight Rises incomparable to this years other superhero blockbusters. While The Avengers may have bigger zings, The Dark Knight Rises has one thing Whedon missed: emotional engagement; a genuine sense of jeopardy and deepening human drama. (OK, three things.)"
"With this film I would say it was quite magical. The affects that took place were spectacular a great increase from The Dark Night. When I saw this film, as a Batman fan I purchased the trilogy ticket starting from the first Batman featuring Christian Bale up to the Dark Night rises.One thing I would have to add is that I feel as if Anne Hathaway didn't live up to the role of Catwoman as I expected also known as Selina. I thought that she could have used some studying from older movies or even comic books to display the attitude of Selina just a little bit more. But overall this was an exciting film and ultimately one of the best Batman movies to come in this day in age. Unfortunately I am not that ecstatic for Ben Afleck to play the new Batman coming out in theaters's in 2015."
"Not being a huge fan of superhero movies, I didn't have much expectations for Batman Begins. However viewing the 2005 Christopher Nolan production, I was pleasantly shocked. Then after my huge expectations for, ""The Dark Knight"", Christopher Nolan blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, ""The Dark Knight Rises""? Quite simply, Yes! My big expectations were once again, blown away. What a production! This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The editing, sound, score, visuals, direction and action are all top notch.

The film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Christian Bale, of course still makes is a great Batman. Michael Cain is fantastic, as he always is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be considered for an Oscar nomination. Tom Hardy as Bane is utterly terrifying, at times, and completely ominous. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman/Selina Kyle is a scene stealer. She is completely engrossing. Everyone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors are so well done, so well written, and so well directed. The Dark Knight Rises is is emotionally riveting and amazing to view.

At a running time of almost 3 hours, the film never becomes dull, which is pretty impressive. The movie's action sequences are spectacularly well created and very intense. The dialogue between the character's are intelligent and highly believable. The movie's soundtrack is terrific and really exemplify's many of the movie's scenes. Extremely well editing and sound use really develop many of the movie's action scenes, so it's not just explosions and visuals like in many other movies. Nolan creates a grand, dirty, engrossing world, and his action sequences just hum.

In conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that great writing and direction can enhance any movie-going experience, even superhero movies, which are usually thought of as mindless entertainment. I am wholly satisfied with Christopher Nolan's vision and thank all who worked on this film for bringing such an intricate interpretation of its very famous literary source. I cannot recommend this film anymore than I have, I just have to say everyone and anyone should see it. 10/10"""
"The Dark Knight trilogy tells us a lot about Nolans understanding of modern cinema, as well as his control over the Batman franchise.

It's not always obvious that Nolan is that interested in the hero genre, more with continuing the journey he started with Inception (along with much of the same cast). But the advantage of this is that the scenes with Batman and Bruce Wayne have no extra gravity to them, giving the chance for characters to develop.

To a degree.

Even approaching 3 hours, Nolan stretches his skill and that of the cast to rush through much of the plot, especially the back-stories that he isn't much interested in. This leads to the usual number of unexplained convergences, plot vacancies and narrative extended death scenes that plague most modern films. Yes, it drives the internet forums and people see the films again but this weakens cinema and strengthens the longer TV serials that attract so many film directors. Nolans exploration of identity (every character has a masked past, present or future) feels compressed here, fitted between the blowing up of the scenery.

Looking through his, er, oeuvre, it is clear that Nolans interest in perception was best met by Christopher Priest with The Prestige. I can see Nolan and Priest combining again, but I can't see him trying another full action film - his disdain for the material is starting to surface."
"This will be a very underrated movie due to the amazingness of The Dark Knight. However, in many ways it is just as groundbreaking, philosophical, profound, and good as its predecessor. It won't necessarily surpass the masterpiece that the Dark Knight is, but it really comes awfully close. It is its own thing, and other than a few sequences midway through and towards the end, it is every bit a masterpiece of action-filmmaking as The Dark Knight. The way Nolan handled the introduction, background, and development of the new characters was a treat and very satisfying. The only difference between this and the Dark Knight really is that the weaknesses of The Dark Knight Rises are just more pronounced. With a few scenes edited out in the middle, it would be just as good. This movie has inspirational components to it, while The Dark Knight has more morality-oriented components to it. But they both contain bits of both."
"The third and final installment in this trilogy is much maligned because of a horrible incident around its release that had nothing to do with the film. While that tragedy is hard to separate from the film, it is unfortunate because the film is very good. The film is as dark and painful to watch as the prior two, but just as good in my opinion. The events of the two prior come together and come full circle as Christian Bale's character has to deal with his past, the events he put in place, and his place in the world. Tom Hardy is excellent as Bane. The supporting cast is terrific. This, like the prior, is an adult film. It is gritty and visceral. The action is chaotic at point but very engaging. I like this story arc. I like these characters. I think the Direction and the visuals are unmatched. While I loved Tim Burton's Batman and respect it immensely nothing compares to this trilogy. It is not just good superhero filmmaking. It is great filmmaking using the superhero story as a vehicle to explore universal themes. See this and see it again."
"What a film! Rarely does one call a superhero flick a cinematic work of art. Well this one certainly is that and much more. It isn't a run-of-the-mill popcorn, action packed, story-less offering that many superhero films are. This one goes above and beyond. It is less about the masked man and more about the man behind the mask, a broken man fighting his own demons. A dark and emotional tale of absolution and revenge, strength and sacrifice. Anne Hathaway is brilliant as Catwoman. Its no wonder she is receiving nominations for her role in this movie and in Les Miserables. Bane i think is the highlight of this movie. His speech may go down in dialogue history. You feel mesmerized and taken aback by the sheer force of this movie. It has everything from the deepest darkest emotions to powerful confrontation scenes and a breathtaking climax. I had no idea so much time had gone by, that is how gripping this film is. Though if you prefer more violence and action, then this may not be for you. Personal opinion: It is the best film of 2012. A must see as it raises the bar for not only superhero flicks but also films in general."
"I love the whole Batman series with Christian Bale. I love the fact his voice was not nearly as annoying in this film. I did not see that twist at the end coming which was a nice surprise. The only thing I didn't like was Bane's character. I think it was just because of the mask thing and not really being able to see him. The actor did a great job portraying the character despite this. This is one of those movies you can watch multiple times and pick up different clues along the way. I do wish Morgan Freeman had a bigger role in this one. Love Lucius! I would like a TV movie of Lucius and Alred having some adventures together. After seeing this one, I think it's time for a Batman marathon."
"The third and final instalment of Christopher Nolan's, Jonathon Nolan's and David S. Goyer's legendary trilogy is my least favourite, but is by no means bad. The problem I have found with 'The Dark Knight Rises' is its loss of realism. 'Batman Begins', the first instalment, was extremely realistic and somehow still faithful to the comics. That was what made the film so amazing, in my opinion. 'The Dark Knight' loses the realism and the faithfulness to a degree, but that wasn't a bad thing. The tension, story, ideas and genuinely scary villains of the second instalment made it not just better than the first instalment, but possibly better than any other superhero film ever made.

The conclusion to this nigh perfect trilogy doesn't come close to the first two, but still satisfies. The realism, possibly the best thing about this trilogy, is gone. There is more than one scene or concept where you may think ""Well that's just plain stupid!"" On realism, it could have been much better. You'll know what scenes and concepts I am speaking of when you see them. Is this film faithful to the comics? No, it's even less faithful than 'The Dark Knight', but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. It means even fans of the comics are in for big, Nolan twists. I believe that it is faithful enough for most fans to enjoy it, but much less faithful than the two previous films.

The writing of this film is much like the last two. It's very Nolan; intelligent but somewhat confusing. I think the problem with this instalment is that the writers tried too hard to make it the biggest and the best. This is part of the reason the film fails to live up to the previous two. The writing is certainly the worst of the three films, but is definitely not bad writing. It still seems dark and mysterious. I think they relied too much on shocks and scary villain scenes than on adding tension and genuinely terrifying, slow scenes. The Joker had many of these scenes in the previous film, seeming unpredictable and adding tension. Due to no more Joker, the humour is gone. This was necessary, but takes away some enjoyment for me.

The directing of this film is much like the previous two. Nolan uses the same style throughout all three instalments. The directing again takes away realism with the action not being realistic. I believe that if the age certificate was bumped up they could have made the film much more terrifying and realistic. The action in the film goes back to relying on fighting usually like in 'Batman Begins', not tension like 'The Dark Knight'. However, there are still tense scenes with Bane (Tom Hardy) that match some of the previous film's Joker scenes. The shots and action scenes are fantastically done, like the previous two, but as I have said, Tim Burton's Gothic look is more preferable to me.

The characters in this are amazing. Hardly any of them seem like their comic book selves, but this can be great, adding a fresh, unique feeling to the film. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is brilliant as Blake, who I do believe adds to the film, unlike others. I also loved the controversial twist with Blake. If it were done any other way it'd probably take away the darker side to the film. The way it was done was very unique and interesting. I loved Cillian Murphy's cameo as Scarecrow again. I always love some Cillian Murphy in a film, and his rather insane Scarecrow adds a lot, in my opinion.

Christian Bale plays a brilliant Batman/Bruce Wayne yet again. I love the dark edge to his character rough voice he uses as Batman. Tom Hardy was terrifying as Bane. He is the opposite of the Joker, thinking out a large scale plan and being calmly menacing. Very different to the comic book Bane in lots of ways, but I do enjoy different takes on characters, instead of the same thing in each remake. Anne Hathaway played an interesting Selina Kyle. She doesn't seem to be into the alter ego thing.. I don't think anyone calls her Catwoman throughout the entire film. Her settling down with Bruce Wayne doesn't appeal to me, as it isn't in character enough.

James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer did an excellent job with the music yet again. All of the tracks are unique and are great additions. The soundtrack is very different to the previous films. The first two instalments use dragged out, slow music to create tension most of the time. This film does that, but to a much lesser degree. What I loved about the series' music in the first two was the tense, slow, metallic music that suits Batman and isn't like the usual exciting, blasting music. This music, while unique, is exciting and blasting usually. It takes the tension away again, which is one of the best things about this trilogy. As a standalone soundtrack, I absolutely love this, but as a part of this trilogy I'm not too fund of it. I much prefer the tense, slow tracks.

Overall, I believe that this is a brilliant last instalment of a genius trilogy. I loved most of it. It is very different from the previous two, which is both good and bad. It felt very exciting and tense at times, and the overall story is excellent, if unrealistic. It is an amazing film, but is not close to as good as the previous two. I find it surprising that this ranks higher than Batman Begins on the Top 250 films. This finale doesn't disappoint. It is a genius conclusion for a genius trilogy. It's not as good as the other two instalments, but beating them would be an absolutely huge achievement. I expected a brilliant film to conclude the series, and that's what I got. Couldn't be happier."
"The best installment of the Batman trilogy, The Dark Knight Rises is involving, gripping, and riveting. The story is on par, as well as a great cast new to the series (Tom Hardy, Anne Hathaway, Marion Cotillard, etc.). The movie never lags, and Tom Hardy's Bane comes across as a testosterone-fueled hunk of a man who knows true pain and wants to do justice in his own twisted ways.

While some may say that the background story of Bane isn't what's in the comics, just stop. Did it fit the movie? Maybe it didn't, because I bet my ass director Christopher Nolan took that into consideration. I bet they did a screen test, and that storyline didn't work. To be honest, it's not that big of a detail and can be easily overlooked, and it didn't do any damage to the story. In fact, it made it *that* much more interesting.

"Only Christopher Nolan, maybe alongside with the uniqueness of James Cameron and Peter Jackson's ""LOTR"" .. was able to push his own limits to deliver a better film every time .. I mean ..Batman Begins was a staggering reboot for the Batman Franchise.. The Dark Knight was simply a masterpiece ..in between there was Inception.. an incredible cinematic vision.. ! But this , The Dark Knight Rises.. is ABSOLUTE GENIUS ! Easily a once in a lifetime experience if u watch that in IMAX I mean ,people.. a 2:45 minutes movie that would keep you glued to your seat the entire time without a moment of boredom ..the entire time blown away..the entire time thinking what's gonna happen next..and hits the climax with a genius ending .. i don't know ,but ..this one has Oscars written all over it..and Nolan deserves it after such an incredible effort on his timeless trilogy and a movie that will be remembered for decades to come ! Performances..Tom Hardy,awesome job "" but still ,Joker is untouchable""..Chris Bale, amazing.. Anne Hathaway , definitely a highlight in this movie..OMG! Visuals.. i can't even start! Editing.. genius ! Score.. Heart pounding with every frame,gripping ! Directing.. mind blowing ! You expected to be blown away by this movie ? well .. i'm sure you will be , and beyond ! Best movie of the year ,hands down..and maybe for years to come ! There could easily be a fourth and a fifth installment..but who knows ,uptil now this trilogy is by far absolute perfection among all movie genres,if i may say ! Bravo Nolan and chapeau,for you are such an artist to look up to. And as for Batman.. well .. you'll always be my favorite superhero. Cheers everyone ."
"Nolan has got us accustomed to a very high standard of film making, no matter what he tackles as the subject. The Dark Knight trilogy is a very good example of this, when your typical superhero films can also stand as powerful pieces of cinema. Alas ""Dark Knight Rises"", after the exploding success of the brilliantly captured ""Dark Knight"", did fell short in comparison. Arguably, the success of any Batman film and even comic/graphic novel is dynamics between our dark hero and the villain, and in my opinion, Batman vs Bane was not taken to it's full potential. The tactical brilliance of Bane, portrayed by Hardy, was always out-shadowed by his brutality and sheer raw power, with a very dubious choice of voice effects that subtracted the terrifying factor right out of the equation, while Bale's performance was never stellar throughout the trilogy, this script did nothing to develop his character, mostly the opposite happened when you reach the end of this story. The big revelation concerning our villain only made the whole concept of Bane even less powerful, shedding some light into some questionable plot holes in the story, and there is an unwelcome sort of cheesy in all Joseph Gordon-Levitt scenes, unquestionably brought to light in the last minutes of the film. All in all, the film does feel like an ending, further deconstructing the myth of Batman, a vigilante created by a common crime by a faceless criminal, to fight so that someone wouldn't suffer through the same."
"There are not enough words to describe the magnitude of this film, let alone space to even attempt it. So I'll do my best with what I have.

This film is perfect in every way. The synergy of elements, both technical, dramatic, and those supplied by the audience (such as emotional investment in the series, etc.) make it perfect. Writer/Director Chris Nolan understood how invested the audiences were in this series and he hit every single note perfectly.

The picture unfolds like a beautiful nightmare. We ease back into the world of Gotham well enough that we recognize the world we left briefly from the Dark Knight. Instantly we feel that the stakes are higher, and as the film goes on, the stakes are raised even further, seemingly impossibly so. Then, finally, as the picture hits its stride, we find ourselves engrossed in a spectacle the likes of which have not been approached since Lord of the Rings.

The depth of story and character, like so many of Nolan's films, are what bring all the elements to a head. Bane is maniacle, calculating, determined, and above all, undeniably and irrevocably brutally violent. This violence takes all forms, and manifests itself into some of the most brilliantly awe-inspiring action sequences you will EVER see.

Dark Knight Rises gets better with every passing second, between the action, the intrigue, the drama, and the mystery, the final result is nothing short of stunning. And while this may be an opinionated review, I beg every person alive to experience what this film has to offer.

I swear on my life this movie is pure perfection."
"Christopher Nolan has finished up the Batman series in remarkable style. Where Batman Begins was about conquering fears and the Dark Knight was about traversing the fine line between order and madness; the Dark Knight Rises seems to be a movie about compromise and acceptance.

It has been eight years since the death of Harvey Dent and Gotham has settled down into some semblance of peace. The main instigators of this crime-free age, however, have many scars for their trouble. Bruce Wayne ( Christian Bale ) is a reclusive cripple- with shot knees and scar tissue riddling his body. Commissioner Gordon ( Gary Oldman ) has found his career is now burdened by the lie that he and Batman wove to keep Harvey Dent's reputation spotless- so much so that he is separated from his family. Alfred ( Michael Caine ) despairs about Bruce Wayne's welfare- fearing that his master wants little more than a grand death. And Lucius Fox ( Morgan Freeman ) is attempting to stave Wayne Enterprises from bankruptcy thanks to all the money that Wayne has invested into Miranda Tate's ( newcomer Marion Cotillard ) renewable energy source.

However a new threat emerges in the guise of Bane ( Tom Hardy )- a massive masked mercenary who has a connection to Batman's past. He claims to want a new Gotham where the 'have-nots' can rule over the 'haves' and bring true justice to the rich and corrupt. Alongside him is Selina Kyle ( Anne Hathaway ) a cat burglar who motives are enigmatic at best. It is therefore up to the old guard as well as idealistic cop John Blake ( Joseph Gordon-Levitt ) to try and hold Gotham together.

Nolan has gone for bigger is better in his third movie of the trilogy and it certainly comes off as an sweeping, epic movie. Christian Bale probably gives his best performance as Bruce Wayne and Batman and the scenes he has with Caine's Alfred are particularly moving. Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman are both very good also- with the scenes between Oldman and Gordon-Levitt ( probably the best of the newcomers ) nice to watch.

But as good as the film is...it doesn't really seem to cover much more new ground. This isn't really helped by their choice of villain. Hardy does a good job as Bane, but he isn't helped by his breathing mask which makes him, at times, hard to understand. Furthermore, while Bane is shown to be dangerous, Nolan seems to be forcing the viewer to show how dangerous he is. Without the personal and affable menace of Neeson's Ra's Al Ghul or the twisted and frightening charisma of Ledger's Joker, Bane's most menacing moments come before the real action kicks off. Furthermore, it's difficult to see why anyone would want to follow him- utopia or not.

As for Catwoman, Hathaway is very good in the role, but her character seems to be frustrating at times- seeming to just sit on the fence for the heck of it. Cotilliard's Miranda Tate is a fairly bland character that doesn't add much to the proceedings either.

Furthermore, while the movie is indeed epic in scope, it sometimes gets lost in its own arcs in a way that the Dark Knight never did. The twists and turns that would have been seen as remarkable in the Dark Knight in this movie came across as almost unnecessary.

Begins was a tight film that revolved around a single plot arc and holds together well. The Dark Knight was the true noir epic- a sweeping tale about morality and order in a insane city. The Dark Knight Rises is a flawed masterpiece- it's achievements not quite living up to the ambitions that it perhaps had. However, any Batman movie directed by Christopher Nolan is probably a good one. This is no exception."
"Nolan nailed it on the head with this one. Banes awesome voice and tyrant role makes this movie flat out the most epic of the trilogy. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, and as mentioned in previously read reviews, Bane on screen really gets your blood pumping. The late Joker had a great plan for corruption, but Bane's plan is simply to rule - and he plays the part perfect. There will certainly be comparisons of the two, but their characters are so entirely different, there is no comparison. Nolan also nails it again with these surprise character roles in Hathaway and Hardy - Bane is by far the most epic villain the Bat has ever seen and Hathaway is surprisingly a sexy and bad ass Catwoman. I am just so bummed this series is over, and very bummed that Nolan's next work is Superman...

Hopeful Robin spin off anyone????"
"Will this add to TDK's legend? Sure, TDK was good but grew to be THE most overrated film of any genre because of the Ledger and Nolan fanboy InterLove. Now, TDKR delivers one of the most unmemorable and downright disappointing sequels ever put to film. Yes, it ranks right down there with Crystal Skull in terms of huge and head scratching let downs.

TDK was fine entertainment that may have gotten over-inflated and over-praised with the passage of time. Don't get me started about Batman Begins. The fact is that TDKR is another Batman Begins without the intrigue. Frankly, that makes Nolan's Batman trilogy a dull sandwich when you think about it. TDK is the meat and the first and now especially the third films are nothing but gummy Wonder Bread equivalents. I can't believe how shallow TDKR turned out despite them trying to jam everything in to the film. Unlike TDK, word of mouth will hurt TDKR because this mangled and often dumb film is a mess. A genuinely un-fun mess at that.

I know certain Nolan fanboys everywhere are circling the wagons to praise this movie but that in and of itself proves what I'm saying. Fanboys wanted to like it and apparently will look past all of its flaws. Everyone else is saying it's written like a shallow popcorn flick but with dull action sequences. There really is nothing special on display here and it's so much LESS than the second effort. How can a film follow something somewhat good with something this bad? It's not just the high expectations. It really is a bad film all on its own.

Yet, thanks to good trailers and a general fondness for TDK, this thing will take in big money early but leave a majority of the audience disappointed to say the least. If the viewer has at least half a brain, it's guaranteed that the actual movie is going to lead to general disappointment especially if you're not already a fan.

Overcrowded and cheesy fluff usually fizzles at the box office but TDKR is bulletproof at this point. The real judge of this movie will be general reaction and most are going to correctly label it a disappointment of epic proportions."
"I did not like how this was the most sentimental of the three Nolan Batman-movies. I prefer when the emotional aspects are more subtle, letting the audience draw its own conclusions about the characters feeling given their circumstances and back-stories. In The Dark Knight I felt the director trusted his audience more to understand Wayne's reactions after having heavily emphasized his childhood in Batman Begins. Whereas in The Dark Knight Rises it was much dwelled upon and fed to us with sentimental music. This made the first part of the movie a bit dreary, but it quickly became more enthralling and kept getting better as the story progressed. The acting was impeccable as were the visuals. I admit to having prejudices against superhero-movies, but the characters are complex and interesting. So was the plot, though it is clearly made to appeal to a mass-audience. There is nothing wrong with being popular and I did not waste my time watching these three movies."
"The Dark Knight Rises ends the Christopher Nolan trilogy based on the DC Comic superhero. Set eight years after the end of The Dark Knight, Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, Michael Cane, and Gary Oldman are back to fight the crime in Gotham City. This time, though, Batman faces one of his toughest opponents yet: Bane(played by Tom Hardy). Joining him are the unpredictable Catwoman(Anne Hathaway), and the young but passionate policeman John Blake( Joseph Gordan-Levitt).

As expected, Christian Bale gives an excellent portrayal of Batman, although this time he is allowed more time to build on Bruce Wayne. Morgan Freeman and Michael Cane bring their best once again, as they seem to always do in their films. Personally, I was a little weary of Anne Hathaway's performance of Catwoman. I've seen many of her films and generally enjoy her work. However, I was unsure if she could pull off Catwoman/Selina Kyle. Well, I was wrong. Hathaway was spectacular and shined in every moment on screen. I could say the same thing about Joseph Gordan-Levitt's performance, too. Sometimes the greatest asset to an actor is his or her ability to control every facial expression. Gordan-Levitt has perfected it, and proved it in his performance in TDKR.

There are only two negative notes to make about this film, as great as it is: the first being that it felt long. Yes, the film is nearly three hours long. And despite the fact that boredom never set in, I still felt the effects of a three-hour movie. At the same time, I didn't mind because there were several new characters who needed introducing and building, so it worked out for the better than the worst. The second, Bane's voice was a bit too raspy for my taste. There were a few moments where I had a difficult time understanding what he was saying. If they would have cleared his voice up just a wee bit more, it would have been perfect.

Overall, the film was fantastic, and was definitely what I was expecting, especially coming from a beautiful cast and superb director. Also, I can't help but mention the perfection that comes from Hans Zimmer. His film scores are sometimes the only reason I'll watch a movie(although not in this case lol)! The Dark Knight Rises was the best ending to this excellent trilogy. Now I'm looking forward to the next big project of Christopher Nolan!"
"The Dark Knight Rises fails to capture the magic of its predecessors. While it was understandable to suspend disbelief for the Joker's antic because of his volatility, the same doesn't hold true for a cold and calculated Bane. This time the nihilistic philosophical lessons come off as pretentious and worn out. Even the repeated formula of action sequences pale in comparison to the first two films. What's left is a hastily done wrap-up of a film with zero character development for the supporting cast and a shallow narrative painted over a faux black."
"I'm writing this for one purpose and one purpose only. I know it's fashionable to hammer Anne Hathaway for her portrayal. But what do people expect from her exactly? Do they want her to puRRR constantly? Do they really expect her to camp it up? That would run contrary to Christopher Nolan's vision. No, she played it to the level of Nolan's vision. She's not camping it up. She's not playing it big. She injects fragility into the character that is very much in keeping with this iteration of Batman. She injects much needed humanity into this character.

As for the movie, I have the same problem as the other 2. Too much explaining. That's why Heath Ledger's Joker is still the best. He did things just because he's crazy. No more explanation needed."
"The story , screenplay were really good. Worth watching. Non stop Action. If you compare it with the MARVEL - ""The Avengers"", then the ""The Dark Knight Rises"" would be a tough competition to beat. I personally wish that the series just goes on.

The film featured excellent performances, by all the cast. Christian Bale, as always is great as Batman. Anne Hathaway was completely engrossing, she became ""Catwoman"", just like Michele Pfeiffer did, although their interpretations were very different, both were equally effective. Tom Hardy was the main villain ""Bane"" completely shattered my expectations.

On the whole""The Dark Knight Rises"" certainly rises a fire for money in the Box Office."
"The Dark Knight has risen! The storm came, roared thunderously and blew everything away! Watching the film evokes the same kind of ecstasy as that of making love. It starts with an extended foreplay, builds up slowly, escalates wildly and culminates into an explosive, intense and unrelenting orgasm. In fact, it's a thousand times better than an orgasm. It's as close as having that romanticized elevated sense of being numb close on the heels of death. When you go numb and your senses fail you, and you are transported into a world that is beautiful, heart-wrenching, dark, compelling, unreal and majestic - you know that the storm has hit you, the fire that rose has engulfed you.

The best part of Nolan's Batman trilogy is that all the 3 films are distinctly different from each other. It would be unfair to compare The Dark Knight Rises with the previous two installments. Batman Begins was a Renaissance-moment, a triumphant interpretation of the caped crusader. His damaged psyche torn apart by guilt and fear - Nolan nails it with precision. And, the original treatment was so refreshing when Rachel points out that Bruce Wayne was the mask that Batman wore, not the other way round. The Dark Knight was edgier, darker, representing a world where chaos and order co-exist and complete each other; the sadistic sinisternerness of the Joker, blurring the boundaries between being amoral and being diabolical, is evidently portrayed - ""What am I without you? To them, you are just a freak, like me. You complete me."" It dealt more with the psychological, a duel between the Agent of Chaos and the Fallen Knight, whereas The Dark Knight Rises is much more physical. Nolan wanted it to be a spectacle, an extravagant and dazzling finale on epic proportions, and he did achieve it. It's no-holds-barred, outrageous and heart-pounding, gut-wrenching, raw action on one hand and on the other, it captures Batman's emotional vulnerabilities like never before. For the self-appointed critics - please stop comparing. Applaud and acknowledge the genius of Christoper Nolan."
"This review is from one of the biggest Batman fans in the world so I have my own special connection with this film and what it all represents but this doesn't mean that people who are not a particular Batman fan will not like this film (even people who love the Avengers will love this film... Probably more.)

Now, the actors & actresses in this film: -Christian Bale (Just wow) -Michael Caine (you may shed a tear in your eyes because of his performance) -Morgan Freeman (Always amazing.) -Tom Hardy (who was brutal as hell. Just fantastic) -Anne Hathaway (who destroyed Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman) -Marion Cotillard (Really, really good) -Gary Oldman (has officially made another iconic character in his long and amazing career)

So, it's safe to say that all the actors & actresses in this film are beyond fantastic.

This film is the best conclusion in the trilogy I have ever seen. The action scenes are fantastically directed and beautifully executed and the writing is beyond fantastic.

Christopher Nolan really smashed it and it is one of his best films he has ever made in his impeccable track record.

This is one of the best films of the year (not because I am a huge batman fan) but because it has a fantastic storyline and amazing action scenes.

I just love this film and yes. It is joint first with the best superhero films of all time and is just one of the best action films of all time."
"Christopher Nolan has delivered a jaw dropping assault on the senses. From the incredibly choreographed fight scenes to the nuanced subtle moments that should have won an Oscar.

From moment one, right at the very beginning of Batman Begins; Nolan has told a story that is very relatable. He made Batman a story that was believable. A story that if you saw it in the newspaper, you'd almost believe it.

This film delivers the best comic book adaption I've ever seen. The ability to draw from the source material, and make it your own whilst simultaneously staying true to the material is a token to how good a story teller this director is.

Not only did the team behind these movies deliver jaw dropping moments, one after the other, but they also helped to build the foundations of the superhero world we know and love today.

If I could give this film a 11 star rating I would. It lives up to be one of the best films I've ever seen."
"""The Dark Knight Rises"" It's not so much a story about The Batman, as much as a story about Gotham City and the people affected by Bruce Wayne's alter ego. It's a culmination of every action taken by The Batman coming down in the form of some menacing villains. It's the most anticipated movie of 2012 and because the bar has been raised so ridiculously high, it doesn't quite live up to the expectations. That doesn't mean that is a bad movie. DKR has excellent performances, a tense story that will keep you on the edge of your seat, cool additions to the Batman mythology and a compelling villain. The climax is one intense experience and what Tom Hardy does with just his eyes and his voice is unbelievable. He is a truly frightening foe for The Batman. Some of the criticisms I have concern the pacing of the film. I felt like at times it runs slightly too long and some of the slow beginning should have been cut a bit. Once the momentum gets going you won't want to miss a single second. It's a satisfying conclusion to the Christopher Nolan trilogy and aside from a few minor things it's pretty much the perfect third film in one of the best trilogies out there. (Theatrical version in Imax, August 29, 2012)"
"a splendid film. for the performance of each actor - Tom Hardy does an admirable work - , for Chistopher Nolan precision of each level of film, for sound and choreography and for its strange end. because it is not exactly last part of a series but top of a lot of expectations. and this fact makes difference. because it is a form of art who represents more than story of a super hero or one of high performances of Christian Bale but a magnificent puzzle , result of refined - wise science of well- crafted. the big problem can be the end, ideal for many other films, not inspired in this case. but the end is only a window. or a state of wind after tension, action and brilliant show. a trilogy who must see it ! not because it remains the best adaptation of Batman story but because it has deep roots and inspired answers for many of viewers."
"The problems with this mess of a movie are endless. Mainly, it's just boring and completely unbelievable...and way too long. There's not nearly enough Batman and, when he is on screen, he mostly gets his ass kicked. Meanwhile the villains are capable of doing everything successfully. As a result, Batman just comes off as tired and lame. The movie's war scenes smack more of Iron Man than Dark Knight. The movie desperately tries to prove how bad-ass Bane is, but he's just...not. Truly, I expected a scene with Bane loading cancer surviving, crippled grandmas into a bus and blowing them up. It was that silly. All the subplots slow things down: I could care less about the backstory of the chick with the accent, Robin (gee, I didn't see that coming two hours before it happened), the corporate stuff, Alfred's blubbering. Dull, dull, dull. Lastly, the sound is amateur. Everything is pushed up front, so it's often difficult to understand dialogue. Just a disorganized mess."
"SOMETIMES TRUTH IS NOT ENOUGH AND PEOPLE MUST BE REWARDED FOR THEIR FAITH'

It's an action-packed, mind blowing trailer that inspires a viewer to cinematic elevation which causes people to feel motivated to do good and increases their altruism.

Whereas, 'Batman: The Dark Knight' plays out ""with the help of allies Lt. Jim Gordon and DA Harvey Dent, Batman has been able to keep a tight lid on crime in Gotham City. But when a vile young criminal calling himself the Joker suddenly throws the town into chaos, the caped Crusader begins to tread a fine line between heroism and vigilantism"" (ref. Google).

While there were a ton of character strengths and virtues exhibited in this film of the following: wisdom, knowledge, creativity, judgement, love of learning, perspective, courage,bravery, perseverance, honesty, zest, humanity, love, kindness, social intelligence, justice, teamwork, fairness, leadership, temperance, forgiveness, humanity, prudence, self-regulation, transcendence, appreciation of beauty & excellence, hope, gratitude, and spirituality.

Now pertaining to the art of watching film; THE THEMATIC ELEMENTS were mild that showcased violence, crime, and corruption for a PG-13-rated drama.

As it was a FICTIONAL story with DRAMATIC ELEMENTS of crime that had villains who were inspired by infamous, criminals of real life.

The VISUAL DESIGN was imaginative. The CINEMATOGRAPHY was very engaging, allowing the audience to feel and seem like they were apart of the action. The SPECIAL VISUAL EFFECTS were powerful. The EDITING was smooth and exciting at times. The COLOR was rich and in full-resolution.

The SOUND EFFECTS were creative. The MUSICAL SCORE was memorable and compelling. The DIALOGUE was strong and expressive.

Now the ACTING showed glimpses of performances that were full of conviction and confidence, as the actors believe in what they're doing. Gary Oldman as Lt. Jim Gordon, Aaron Eckhart as DA Harvey Dent, Christian Bale as Batman, and Heath Ledger as the Joker were all brilliant. These actors stayed truthful in the moment and emotionally connected, as they fully transformed into their characters; to stay true to the original comic book characters.

Nevertheless, the DIRECTOR'S STYLE of Christopher Nolan was clear and full of vision as a confrontationalist; in this style of directing, the director is in constant dialogue and debate with the cast and the production team about creative decisions and interpretations. The director seeks out and actively engages in such exchanges. Out of these exchanges, which can sometimes be risky, comes a final contested product as we can see through the select choices of shots.

Overall the 'Batman: the Dark Knight' movie was phenomenal, but one thing I didn't agree with was the portrayal of schizophrenia paranoid-type in the joker; Hollywood seemed to have beefed it up. Yet you got to love Batman's heart for people as he loved unconditionally, giving them (even his enemies) a choice, and always seemed to make the right decisions; to reward people for their faith."
"Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends the realm of superhero film to become a profound exploration of human nature and the complexities of heroism. This epic conclusion to Nolan's Batman trilogy is a tour de force of filmmaking, boasting a narrative depth, visual splendor, and emotional resonance that is truly unparalleled.

The film masterfully weaves together themes of rebirth, redemption, and the fragility of hope, creating a tapestry of human experience that is both intimate and universal. Christian Bale delivers a tour-de-force performance as a Batman grappling both physical and psychological demons, while Anne Hathaway's Catwoman is a captivating and complex anti-heroine. Tom Hardy's Bane is a chillingly formidable antagonist, a force of nature that Batman and Gotham to their limits.

Nolan's meticulous attention to detail is evident in every frame, from the breathtaking cinematography to the haunting Hans Zimmer score. The action sequences are visceral and exhilarating, while the quieter moments are imbued with a raw emotional power. The Dark Knight Rises is more than just a blockbuster; it is a cinematic experience that lingers in the mind long credits roll.

It is a film that demands to be seen, and re-seen, to fully appreciate its brilliance."
"Nolan continues with the last chapter of the trilogy dedicated to the Dark Knight and closes the circle of the story. As always, he appears to be an introverted character full of internal conflicts who will find himself having to clash with everything and everyone to deal with the new threat, ""Bane"". As always, the plot is full of interesting ideas and is confirmed to be of the highest level although perhaps not reaching the peaks of the two previous stories, and hence my 9. It certainly brings to completion a saga that will remain immortal and will probably no longer be affected by any another suitor. For all those who love the genre, absolutely unmissable and ""obligatory"" for those who have viewed the two previous chapters."
"WOW, JUST WOW! Nolan has created posible one of the best trilogys of all time.

Look if im being honest this was the batman movie I was less excited to watch, it could never top the dark knigth, and the addition of catwomen just seem like a lacy addition to add something new. But oh was I thankfully wrong.

This movie explored new caracters such as bane and catwomen and they were perfectly introduce.

One of the things I most liked was how it was connected to the series roots, it had many connections with the first movie which was something I liked.

I also really like how depressing it is for batman, this movie takes the suffering more emotionaly which really made me feel bad for batman.

The villan was extrenly decent, it wasent the joker yet it was still good. The performances were nice.

9.5 out of 10 truly one of the best superheroe movie."
"What an end to the Batman trilogy. It's rare for sequels nowadays to be as good as the original but their are exceptions and the Batman trilogy was was one of em.

A solid story with great pacing and a plot that made sense and was engaging from the beginning till the end. The music composition and visuals were fantastic the best out of the trilogy. Bane's character was just awesome, Tom Hardy really did an amazing job. Lastly a brilliant job on the writing.

Overall an enjoyable movie that had a remarkable yet emotional ending Memorable: Yes. Rewatchable: Yes"
"A disappointing movie, Ben's character, despite the wonderful performance from Tom Hardy, that he was a character that was not up to par and the characters in the film made many stupid decisions"
"As time goes by and the hype dies down and the Nolanites either grow up or move on to other agendas, this film will be seen for what it really is; a bloated, stupid, preposterous and dull entry in the cinematic adventures of The Batman. If you are looking for Batman, you will be disappointed as he is scarcely in the film. The first half is particularly dull and could have easily been edited down drastically to ease some of the pain. The pacing picks up in the second half, but unfortunately, so does the absurdity in the plot. The motivation of the villains is never explained in anywhere close to a satisfactory manner and their actions defy all logic. The ending is particularly laughable and even embarrassing to watch. Nolan fans who claim that these Batman films are somehow rooted in the real world aren't really paying attention. This film is every bit as bad as the Schumaker films, worse because this takes itself seriously. THE DARK KNIGHT probably stands as the best Batman film to date despite it's own flaws. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is the worst. I'd rather watch Adam West as Batman than this mess."
Nothing more needs to be said. The trilogy just builds up to this amazing end. I had a small hope that maybe just maybe it would be a continuation with Bale and Nolan doing another one. That hope was destroyed when Affleck got the role..
"As everything this amazing human-being produced, this is an incredible movie. His batman trilogy is truly for everyone, fantasy/sci fi fans or not. You are gonna love this. Thanks Nolan and Christian Bale. to Freeman and Caine aswell."
"In a world inundated with superhero sagas, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" emerges as a triumph of complexity and depth. Director Christopher Nolan's epic conclusion to his Batman trilogy transcends the confines of the genre, elevating it to the realm of modern mythology.

Set in a Gotham City teetering on the brink of anarchy, the film explores the cost of heroism and the intricate dance between light and darkness. Christian Bale, reprising his role as the brooding vigilante, brings a raw and tormented humanity to Bruce Wayne, reminding us that beneath the mask lies a fractured soul seeking redemption.

Tom Hardy's Bane, a menacing force of chaos, proves to be a formidable adversary, and his presence looms large over every frame. His chillingly measured voice and brute strength make him a worthy counterpart to the Caped Crusader.

What truly sets ""The Dark Knight Rises"" apart is its unflinching examination of the human spirit. It delves into themes of fear, pain, sacrifice, and the indomitable will to rise in the face of adversity. The film challenges us to confront our own inner demons and question the nature of heroism.

The technical prowess on display is nothing short of breathtaking. Hans Zimmer's haunting score serves as the heartbeat of the film, and Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grandeur and grit of Gotham City with equal finesse. The practical effects, especially during the mesmerizing aerial sequences, ground the film in a visceral reality that few superhero movies achieve.

While some may find fault in the film's ambitious narrative and its occasional leaps of logic, these imperfections only add to its allure. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" refuses to spoon-feed its audience, instead demanding engagement and contemplation.

In conclusion, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a masterful conclusion to one of the most celebrated trilogies in cinematic history. It's a symphony of chaos and redemption, a testament to the enduring power of storytelling, and a reminder that heroes can rise, even in the darkest of times. This is not merely a superhero movie; it's a cinematic journey that resonates on a profound level, leaving a lasting imprint on the."
"For a while, I maintained that this was the best of the Dark Knight trilogy. Watching it for the first time in a few years, I can certainly see why. The second half is pure spectacle filmmaking at an epic scale with an extended set piece that feels expansive and alive and huge all at once. However, that first hour or so is much messier, and I think that last half of the film, largely got me to ignore some of the niggling issues that frontend the film.

The Batman has been absent from Gotham City for eight years. In that time, Gotham has seen a period of peace and prosperity it has not experienced in a very long time. In order to create that sense of calm, though, Police Commissioner Gordon pumped up the idol of Harvey Dent who had become the psychopathic villain Two-Face, murdered several people, and threatened to kill Gordon's son as the White Knight, blaming all of his crimes on Batman. Together with the Mayor and the City Council, they passed the Dent Act which allowed for aggressive anti-crime actions on the part of the police, resulting in a city without any serious organized crime at all. In this time, Bruce Wayne, Batman's alter ego, has become a recluse, having spent several post-Batman years and half of his fortune pursuing a fusion reactor before suddenly shutting it down and closing himself off from the world.

In enters Bane, a member of the League of Shadows and a former acolyte of Ra's Al Ghul, since excommunicated for his extreme methods. After the death of Ra's Al Ghul, Bane took over the League of Shadows and will continue the man's mission of burning Gotham to the ground, much like the League had done to Rome and London before it. The revolution he ignites is based heavily on the Jacobins of France during the French Revolution, which fits hand in hand with the overall movie's ties to Charles Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities. He speaks of equality, but he rules with an iron fist, establishing a Committee for Public Safety, so to speak, that summarily executes enemies of the revolution. In order to get there, though, Bane must take control of Gotham.

Now, the first half of the film is really setup for the giant spectacle that dominates the second half, and some of it is quite good and other elements end up going a bit too far. From beginning to end, I think Bane is great. He's intimidating physically and he ends up with a great plan to acquire wealth and demean Batman at the same time. Stealing his fingerprints through Catwoman/Selina Kyle to fake reckless options trading that wipes out his position in Wayne Enterprises is wonderful. The chase out of the Stock Exchange, giving Bruce Wayne his first moment as Batman in eight years, is exciting and well filmed. That it leaves Wayne so destitute that he can't pay his own power bill is...curious and a step too far. I get the point. The point is to take Wayne as low as possible both as Batman and as Wayne himself, but having his power shut off because of nonpayment roughly a day after his loses all his money feels weird at best and completely ignorant of how things work in the real world at worst.

Another very good thing that the first hour does is establish the overall thematic thrust of the film, and that's around pain. Bruce is suffering from a leg injury. That's good. He immediately gets cured well enough to fight as Batman again because of a gadget on his leg. That's...less good. And yet, the idea runs through the rest of it very well. Wayne carries the pain of his loss of Rachel Dawes, from The Dark Knight (to the point that people misinterpret his receding from the world due to that loss, but that's not the case). Gordon carries the pain of having to defend the man who tried to kill his son, while losing that son in a divorce at the same time. The city carries the scars of past trauma brought on by the Joker, but it manages to live on, just as Gordon does. And what do these people do with their pain? Well, more pain must come first.

Bane's efforts to take the city end up feeling great. He has an inside man at Wayne Enterprises, also knows that Wayne is Batman because of his connection to the League of Shadows, and he uses the greed of Daggett, a wealthy executive who wants to absorb Wayne Enterprises, to prepare his plan of cutting off the city from the rest of the world. But first, he must take out the Batman. That the ""every police officer"" gets trapped in the sewars is...less good, though. It's another step too far that didn't quite need to be taken. However, this element of the plot is where Selena Kyle is useful.

Anne Hathaway as Selena Kyle is really good. She can switch between woundedly scared and feminine to coyly vicious and feminine in an instant. She steals into Wayne Manor as a servant at a party and shows both sides to Bruce as she steals his mother's pearls and his fingerprints, setting up the plot of the film. She's a survivor with a chip on her shoulder, so she's happy to watch as Bruce loses everything as the result of her actions. However she does still have a certain sense of justice so when Bane completely takes over and Gotham descends into a hellscape reminiscent of the French Terror, she's bothered by it, but being a survivor she does little to stop or escape it.

The movie turns when Batman has his confrontation with Bane. Evoking the famous comics scenario of Bane breaking Batman's back in the Knightfall run (pretty much the only time I was reading comics, by the way), Bane breaks Batman and sends him to a prison with hope, the worst punishment he can imagine. The visual image of Bruce needing to rise from the pit in order to overcome his pain and fear is great. That it takes him so much effort and that he has to essentially return to an earlier form of himself in order to do it is even better. There's such rich imagery here.

The final confrontation between Batman, as a symbol of order, and Bane, as a symbol of chaos and fire, dominates the last half of the movie. The film leaves open some unimportant questions of how Bruce Wayne gets from India to Gotham in about three weeks, but considering the character's history of running in the underworld, including in the Far East, that seems easily filled in by the audience, and once he's there he leads an all out rebellion against the ruling Revolutionary government with an aim towards getting his hands on the nuclear bomb set to go off in twelve hours. Yeah, it's very comic booky, but it's handled with the right balance of seriousness that I think the movie sells the situation well.

And in terms of the final act, the spectacle of Batman leading an army in a war against Bane for control of Gotham and against a Jacobin Revolution is great. Batman the symbol leads those who had cowered away in fear to take to the streets, fulfilling the promise of Batman as a symbol established in the first movie (and re-explained to Blake, the cop who has figured out that Wayne is Batman in...another individual step that feels too far in the first half). The evocation of A Tale of Two Cities also helps provide the film a literary understructure that I appreciate. It's not just random bad guys butting up against a protagonist we all know from pop culture. It's a literary extension of the mythos.

I feel like this was a bit of a ramble, but I'm gonna stick with it. The Dark Knight Rises is not a perfect movie. Its first half ends up taking a few ideas too far, which undermines them slightly, but not the overall story. What ends up carrying it all, though, is Nolan's sheer command of everything outside the script. Performances are very good. The spectacle is great. The use of image and sound creates a large story that carries interesting ideas about pain and the efforts to deal with it. It's an intelligent and rousing film that could have been a bit tighter, but, by the end, I don't really care that much."
"The Dark Knight Rises is so amazing!! Arguably one of the best & most underrated CBM's of all time. Although it is slow at times, the 3rd act is superb and so intriguing. I love all the characters in this film Catwoman, Bane, Natalia and especially Blake as he is such an amazing edition to this movie. It's such an amazing end to this wonderful trilogy. This twist in this film is fantastic and works so well and if I'm gonna be honest, TDKR ending is one of my favourites in any film!! Overall The Dark Knight Rises is so good and I love it a lot."
"The Dark Knight Rises arrived in cinemas on the back of deafening hype. The astronomical expectations seemed insurmountable for even a visionary of Christopher Nolan's caliber. So does Nolan deliver? Absolutely! Bold and unflinching, Nolan's operatic style makes The Dark Knight Rises an art piece of boundless spectacle and an epic of never-seen-before scope and scale. It visually obliterates the modern blockbuster with a story of daring boldness, taking your inner child on a savage ride.

The final chapter of Nolan's trilogy kicks off exactly eight years after the end of The Dark Knight. The streets of Gotham have been cleaned up but as we soon find out, all that means is that the criminals have moved underground. Having taken the fall for the death of Harvey Dent, Bruce Wayne, the tycoon behind the cowl, now lives like a specter hobbling about the recesses of his fancy mansion while his faithful butler Alfred frets over him like a gawking mother goose. But something is stirring deep beneath Gotham's streets, and it is not long before Wayne once again finds himself staring into the heart of human darkness. When a hulking, masked psycho named Bane lays siege to his financial empire and plants a series of strategically placed explosives beneath the city, intending to cut off the isle's citizenry from the outside world, he hauls the bat-suit out of storage.

From there, the movie unfolds with the carefully measured pacing of an epic, that rare sequel that endeavors to deepen and expand upon what has come before rather than merely repackaging it. It returns us to Gotham and its denizens, taking its time, gradually showing us the lay of the land. And once the cogs start whirring and the machine starts to warm up, The Dark Knight Rises takes off like a rocket – with Hans Zimmer's propulsive score as its fuel. And when it fires on all cylinders, it enters classic territory.

The pedigree of the cast imparts automatic gravitas to the movie. Christian Bale gives us a Batman with a haunted quality, showing Wayne broken, rising, and risen in perfect succession. Gary Oldman retains his quiet dignity as Commissioner Gordon. Michael Caine's Alfred continues to class up the joint. Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle, is sexy, confident, and offers a great balance of humor. As Officer John Blake, Joseph Gordon-Levitt musters an interesting blend of earnestness and intensity. Both Marion Cotillard and Morgan Freeman execute their parts with precision. And Hardy is sensational as the diabolical antagonist Bane. He bites into his character's motivations and transcends the movie to a place that is darker and more malicious.

Nolan gives us an intellectual, heart-pounding movie that grips like a vice from minute one and never lets go, capping off the trilogy with passion and dignity and with slam-bang entertainment. The Dark Knight Rises is both the conclusion the franchise needs and the conclusion it deserves!"
"The dark knight rises is a marvelous conclusion to Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. Everything is top notch in this movie. The acting, the writing, the cinematography, the storyline, the visual effects are all perfect in this movie Just Awesome"
"Bale made Batman fearsome and intense, whoever gave the go to make Bale Batman had a good idea"
A perfect conclusion to the Christopher Bale series of The Batman movies
"The best Bruce Wayne we've ever gotten in a movie. Every scene with him and the other characters, especially Alfred, are some of the best of the trilogy. The strongest part of the movie, for me, is the prison sequence with Bruce. I get chills every time he makes the climb.... everything surrounding him is flawless in my eyes.

My main negatives that bring the score down are the eventual arcs of the villains in the movie and honestly Anne Hathaway does not work in these types of roles. Some of the plot elements feel a bit rushed and don't pack nearly as big of a punch as The Dark Knight. Bane's takeover of the city feels far less believable than the Joker's.

Despite those flaws, it's hard to end a trilogy with this good of an entry. I think, thematically, its brilliant and it's also a fantastic story for Bruce Wayne's character.

This ending is also incredible, and I get chills every time I see it. Hans Zimmer's score is legendary."
"The only thing that made me laugh harder at the theater than the ""drama"" foisted upon the audience was the subset of audience members themselves who actually took this seriously. the last batman movie i saw in theaters was 15 years ago. i did enjoy the original films. they were always usually pretty fun and entertaining and i thought maybe this would be similar. i hadnt seen the other 2 movies in this newer set all the way through before seeing this so i didn't get what exactly was going on, but all sequels usually aren't connected with the previous ones all that much, but i guess this one was. In all seriousness, I've never laughed so hard at a film that tried to take itself this seriously. the comic book feel of the other films has vanished completely and instead we are given a very bland, boring, ""average"" movie that really doesn't feel much like anything batman-related. i cant believe the rating for this movie! its utterly ridiculous. my guess is its the hype and hype alone. the movie itself is instantly forgettable and i hope whatever other movies they make go back to the old style of batmans, not this law and order rubbish. my advice is this movie is a total waste of 2 hours and if you want a real good batman movie watch the tim burton movies from the 90's. oh and the val kilmer one too:)"
"I enjoyed the movie, fun, fast paced action as we expected, but there were waaaay too unrealistic exaggerated, and even absurd scenes, in my opinion.The best example of this is when Bruce Wayne escaped from being imprisoned for a long time in a hole that was hundrets, thousands of miles away, being alone and without resources and very wounded to go back to a Gotham City who was completely CLOSED for anyone to enter and exit just in the perfect moment to be in a suit and meet Catwoman and say an 'americanish' catchphrase. This is the ugliest example, but there are more moments when very alert action stops for a kiss between selina and batman or for the villain to tell the story of their life just before killing Batman...These scenes made me facepalm hard... Overall, a fun action packed movie which makes you jump off your seat a lot of times, but fails to meet the Dark Knight expectations."
"This is more than just the conclusion to a trilogy-it's the final chapter of a hero's journey that's as personal as it is epic. From the moment the film begins, you're pulled into a Gotham that's teetering on the edge, and Bruce Wayne, weary and broken, must summon the strength to don the cape once more. Christian Bale brings a raw humanity to Bruce, making his struggle against Bane-a villain unlike any Batman has faced before-feel intensely personal. As Gotham falls into chaos, you feel the weight of every decision, every sacrifice, and every blow that Bruce takes.

What makes The Dark Knight Rises resonate so deeply is its focus on the man behind the mask. It's not just about Batman fighting to save Gotham; it's about Bruce Wayne fighting to find himself again, to reclaim his life after years of pain and loss. The film's action is breathtaking, but it's the quieter moments-the glimpses of Bruce's vulnerability, the loyalty of his allies, the hope for a better tomorrow-that truly stay with you. The ending, filled with both closure and new beginnings, leaves you feeling uplifted, reminding you that even in the darkest times, there's always a reason to rise. The Dark Knight Rises isn't just an action-packed spectacle; it's a deeply human story about redemption, resilience, and the enduring power of hope."
"The Dark Knight Rises had to be stunning and spectacular and brilliant just...because. After a very good start with Batman Begins and a truly magnificent follow-up with The Dark Knight how could Christopher Nolan go wrong? Expectations were off the charts. And those expectations were not quite met. Nolan certainly didn't get it all wrong but he surely didn't get it all right either. There's no way around it, this film is not as good as The Dark Knight. Does that mean it's a total letdown? No, not at all. It just means it is not the glorious triumph everyone expected. It's a satisfying finish to a great trilogy. People were just hoping to be able to use a better word than ""satisfying"".

So why does this film not measure up to the last one? Well there are a few reasons but one stands out above the rest. It's glaring and obvious and there was nothing Nolan could have done about it. This film misses Heath Ledger's Joker. Bane is an ominous presence. But a rather dull one. And what the heck is he saying anyway? The Joker had a manic intensity to him that this film sorely misses. Stretched out to almost three hours, clearly too long for its own good, this film desperately needed some real jolts along the way. Someone had to grab a hold of the story and shake the audience up. The Joker did that, Bane does not. Yes, Bane is frightening and foreboding and clearly very dangerous. But the personality just isn't there. There's no sense of wonder. The Joker always had you on your toes, what would he do next? Bane never intrigues you that way.

If you miss the Joker it could also be said that this film leaves you missing Batman. Christian Bale is solid as ever in the dual role of Bruce and Bat but in this film he spends very little time in that famous costume. We see an awful lot of Bruce Wayne, very little of Batman. The other familiar faces from the first two films are back. Gary Oldman and Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman doing what they do. New characters? Well, there's Anne Hathaway doing a better than expected job playing Selina Kyle, who's kinda sorta maybe but not really Catwoman. Marion Cotillard plays Miranda Tate, investor in a Wayne Enterprises energy project. This character is woefully underdeveloped which proves to be problematic. Tom Hardy does the best he can with Bane, a very challenging villain to portray. Hidden away behind a mask it's hard to infuse the character with any personality. And again, seriously, what the heck is he saying? And there's Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing young police officer John Blake who knows Bruce Wayne is Batman just...because.

The fact this nobody cop knows Batman's identity is not the only disappointing contrivance required to move the plot along. The location of Bane's lair? Convenient. The entire Gotham police force trapping themselves underground? Very, very convenient. And dumb. And let us not even delve into Bruce Wayne's remarkable healing powers. This is a story which at times really struggles for momentum. With the Joker around lack of energy was never going to be a problem in the last film. Here things really get bogged down on more than one occasion. But while the film certainly has its flaws it does ultimately manage to satisfy. The trilogy gets the big sendoff it deserves. The Dark Knight Rises doesn't reach the spectacular heights of Nolan's last Batman effort so maybe you come away a touch disappointed. But taken on its own merits this is a good film. True greatness may elude it but it is a worthy end to a terrific saga."
"A horrible, bloated, clumsy and often surprisingly amateurish mess that constantly reaches for profoundly unearned emotions and falsely pumped-up thrills.

Ann Hathaway's Catwoman is, by miles, the best thing in this overcrowded, misguided concoction (of course she's never called Catwoman, because ultimately Nolan is embarrassed to be doing a super hero movie, as virtually every creative decision he makes here proves). But like anything else that might even be a little bit interesting in this movie, her character and storyline are steamrolled with the rest of the ingredients into a flat, boring cacophony.

The music is relentlessly pounding, probably in the hopes that you wont notice how rickety and poorly crafted the story is.

Christian Bale virtually phones in his performance. He plays Batman as a mouth-breather (he actually never closes his mouth when in the cowl, making Batman look like some poor kid at summer camp with severe allergies) and he's incapable of bringing the slightest touch of character to Bruce Wayne. Where is Batman the master martial artist? The World's Greatest Detective? The unstoppable force of nature? Not here. Not in this movie.

And the amazing Tom Hardy? Completely wasted and mostly unintelligible.

The script is a train wreck. There are more plot holes and leaps of logic in this film than in the Avengers, and that movie had a Norse God fighting alongside a monster of science against giant interdimensional worms. The Avengers, by the way, was twice as fun, which was expected, but shockingly, only half as stupid as this movie.

Here, let me give you a rundown of terrible, terrible logic loops, sustained stupidity, and just flat out disregard the for audience's intelligence. SPOILERS!

1. A massive terrorist raid on the stock exchange to make a single trade that leaves Bruce Wayne Broke. Okay... what the f.u.c.k.? A. Hacking a computer system does not require proximal space violence. It's called hacking. B. You're telling me they didn't shut down the stock exchange in a crises situation? C. No one questioned a massive trade that rendered one of the wealthiest men in the world broke, when that trade was performed in the middle of a destructive high-speed chase that would have been news across the entire country, let alone the entire world?

2. Batman and Bruce Wayne are the least interesting characters to the filmmakers. Batman's time on screen is incidental and his actions boring. It is a Batman film with no interest in Batman at all.

3. The Harvey Dent tough-on-crime bill has ended crime? Have you ever seen, in your lifetime, a city go from total social meltdown to utopia where the cops have nothing to do, because of a single bill that was passed? Later, when Gordon knows Dent didn't die a hero, he doesn't tell anyone, because somehow this will make the law less effective? For all his desire to make a ""real world"" superhero film, Nolan obviously has no idea about how the real world works. Toon Town in the Roger Rabbit movie had a more realistic governing set of laws.

4. Bruce Wayne is in prison forever and we hear the same damn story told over and over and over again, and it's all gender neutral so they can have one last tedious reveal at the end.

5. ""Your spinal vertebrae is sticking out of your back, here let me just punch it in! GHA! There much better. Only a matter of time before you're batman again.""

6. I once saw an episode of Vice Travel where some journalist bought a dirty bomb in Chechnya for a handful of cash. Yeah. But Bane doesn't like doing things the easy way. God forbid he just buy a bomb from a corrupt ex-soviet general. No, instead he elaborately fakes the death of a scientist (apparently the only nuclear physicist in the world, by the way), waits for Wayne to build a fusion generator beneath Gotham so he can then steal its core and use it as an atomic bomb to hold ALL OF GOTHAM hostage. Then kills the scientist.

7. It takes five months for the US to send special ops into Gotham? Really? Let's say Gotham is New York, which it is in this ponderous piece of crap. Let's say a terrorist was holding New York Hostage... for five months. You're telling me that the citizens of New York, that the military of the United States, that the nuclear scientists of the world... are going to let that happen? That the people won't rise up immediately, that the military won't have drones flying around constantly looking for radiation signatures and have infiltrated the whole damn island with special ops, that the scientists won't figure out a way to drop EMP pulse grenades across the island to shut down the mechanical device that triggers the fission explosion? Five months of just sitting on their hands?

8. An atomic explosion off the coast of Gotham, and everything's cool! No worries! Radiation fallout? Na. Poisoned ocean? Forget about it. No big deal.

9. And the worst crime of all, the co-opting of the OCCUPY RHETORIC to disenfranchise the movement. Occupy Wall St. slogans are readily and repeatedly spoken by a monstrous, mad, deceiving, mass murdering terrorist. Do we ever see the plight of the average joe in DK Rises? Never. Which is shocking since there are about 300 characters, each with more screen time than Batman. What we get is a real life political movement used in the fictional service of Kangaroo Courts, martial law, and dictatorship. I don't care if Nolan meant for Bane to be using the language of Occupy for his own corrupt and selfish ends, it's irresponsible filmmaking.

And that's just some of the eye-rolling stupidity packed into this thing.

All and all, DK Rises is tedious, boring crap."
A thrilling epic conclusion to the dark knight film saga. this has to be one of the best ending films of all time Christopher Nolan did an excellent job the effects were great the music was cool the plot was amazing the characters were well thought of and the dark feeling of it make it amazing. people lets give Christopher Nolan a long applause
"The perfect conclusion to the perfect trilogy.

Nolan's third and final installment of this series is one of the most hard hitting, emotional thrill rides I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing. The final resolution is executed in the most beautifully cinematic way possible. I don't have any criticism of this film at all, it's such a carefully crafted film that if I had to list something negative, I would have to nitpick, and in this 2 hour and 40 minute classic, that simply would be an exercise in futility. The film gets so much right with it's themes and characters, that it hits every note perfectly just like it's two predecessors do. 10/10"
"In 2012, director Christopher Nolan delivered the epic conclusion to his groundbreaking Batman trilogy with ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Set against the backdrop of Gotham City's descent into chaos, this gripping tale of redemption, sacrifice, and heroism solidified Nolan's status as a visionary filmmaker and left audiences spellbound from start to finish.

From the jaw-dropping action sequences to the thought-provoking themes woven throughout the narrative, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a cinematic tour de force that transcends the superhero genre. At its core, the film explores the timeless struggle between good and evil, as Batman, portrayed with raw intensity by Christian Bale, grapples with his own inner demons while facing off against the formidable villain Bane, played with chilling menace by Tom Hardy.

What sets ""The Dark Knight Rises"" apart from other superhero films is its depth and complexity. Nolan skillfully crafts a multi-layered narrative that challenges viewers to confront difficult questions about power, justice, and the nature of heroism. As the stakes escalate and Gotham teeters on the brink of destruction, the film forces us to reckon with the consequences of our actions and the choices we make in the pursuit of a better world.

Visually stunning and thematically rich, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a feast for the senses that demands to be experienced on the big screen. From the breathtaking aerial shots of Gotham's skyline to the pulse-pounding showdowns between Batman and his adversaries, every frame is meticulously crafted to immerse viewers in the dark and gritty world of Gotham City.

In addition to its spectacular action sequences, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is anchored by a stellar ensemble cast that delivers powerhouse performances across the board. Anne Hathaway shines as the enigmatic cat burglar Selina Kyle, while Michael Caine delivers a heart-wrenching portrayal of Bruce Wayne's loyal butler, Alfred. Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt round out the ensemble with performances that are both compelling and nuanced.

Overall, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a triumph of storytelling and filmmaking that delivers on every level. With its exhilarating action, thought-provoking themes, and unforgettable performances, it cements Christopher Nolan's legacy as one of the greatest directors of our time and solidifies Batman's status as a cultural icon. Whether you're a die-hard fan of the Caped Crusader or simply a lover of great cinema, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a must-watch that will leave you breathless until the very end."
"Batman has defeated Ras-al-Ghul and his ninjas. He's defeated the Joker, a madman who only wanted to see the world burn. But now he faces Bane, a man who grew up in the world's darkest, cruelest dungeon. A man so dangerous he was excommunicated from the League of Shadows. A man with thousands of followers and millions of dollars at his disposal. And despite what the people closest to him say, Gotham needs Batman more than ever. Because in order to live up to his last Batman movie, Christopher Nolan has upped every stake and pulled every stop.

Looking back, it's obvious that no one could top Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker. None of the other villains in Batman's rouges gallery could be as frightening or disturbing as his Joker. But in Ed Hardy's Bane, Nolan has found a villain more powerful and far more dangerous. Bane is perhaps the ultimate physical combatant; massive, incredibly strong, all but impervious to pain. Comic book fans know him as the man who put Bruce Wayne in a wheelchair, and here he does worse. And he is very smart, and totally insane. The Joker was like a serial killer, a mad dog. Bane's madness is one of megalomania and unfettered hatred. The Joker sought to corrupt; he seeks to dominate and to destroy.

And yet he has the gall to present himself as a hero, a liberator. After entombing the entire police force and taking Gotham hostage, he claims that he is giving the city back to the people, that he is giving them freedom from those in power who have oppressed and exploited them, that he has brought justice and equality. But he lies. His freedom is nothing more than anarchy, the freedom to kill and steal. His justice is a mockery of the word in which having too much wealth or being part of the old order are capital crimes. His equality is the wholesale liquidation of the rich, leaving a world in which everyone is equally poor. In throwing down the old order built on law and the power of wealth, he has built a new one based on fear and the power of the gun. And it's all just preparation for ultimate destruction.

Against this mad warlord Batman's help comes from the unlikeliest of sources; master thief Catwoman (Anne Hathaway). When we meet her she's motivated only by money and self preservation, and like any good thief she convinces herself that t she's only stealing from those who can afford to lose it. She warns Batman that there's a storm coming, and he and his friends had best prepare. But when her storm arrives she realizes the old truth that you should be careful what you wish for. Hathaway's charm and wit make her perfect for this role, and her acrobatic fighting moves are stunning. I think it's safe to say that the last remaining taint of the Halle Berry version has been lifted from the character.

Nolan has outdone himself with the action sequences. The opening scene is every bit as forceful and unsettling as the one in Dark Night, with a coolness factor that rivals the best of James Bond. The climactic battle between Gotham's finest and Bane's thugs is one of the largest and most spectacular scenes of its kind, with hundreds of combatants crowding the city streets.. And the fights between Batman and Bane are everything fanboys could hope for. Eschewing precision and flair, these showdowns are brutally physical, with the effects of every blow being seen and heard. For me, this was one of the most satisfying brawls since Sean Connery took on Robert Shaw nearly fifty years ago.

This final installment in the franchise doesn't have a many twists and turns as its predecessor, but the ones it does have are still impressive. Bane's plans are a bit simpler than the Joker's, but no less genius, and he is equally as adept at predicting his opponents' moves. And although leaked information from an entertainment blog had given me foreknowledge of one major revelation, I was totally unprepared for the manner of this revelation and its effect on the story.

This is also a film rich with subtext. Bane's violent overthrow of Gotham's powers that be and his iron-fisted reign form a microcosm of countless violent revolutions. It could easily be a stand for the French Revolution, the Ayatollah's rise in Iran, or any of the various communist revolutions. In a period of unprecedented bloodshed and chaos, a determined man overthrows the old regime, only to replace it with one far worse. And just like Stalin or Mao, Bane knows that he's not doing any of this for the people. The only difference is that he doesn't even need to win public support, because he already has his mercenaries and thousands of released convicts.

The Dark Knight Rises may not be as scary as the last film, it's not quite as deep, and I will admit that it lacks any performance to equal Heath Ledger's. But it is smart, thrilling, action packed and suspenseful. It's dark and brooding without being overpowering, and it does an excellent job of linking the narrative back to the first film. It is the summer's best movie and a worthy end for the Dark Night Trilogy."
"I have not seen the movie but I read a post on Facebook I really liked. That Christian Bale should visit the kids who were injured by the Aurora killings,in the real Batman suit. Please post this to Facebook, other IMDb reviews, etc. And so he can show the kids that heroes really do exist,not just the evil people Satan has affected. He is working overtime because he knows his time is almost up. Dear Christian Bale, please visit the injured children from the movie massacre as Batman, you have the power to be a hero right now,not a movie hero,a real life flesh and bone one. I did not write this I found it on Facebook, I stole it because it was amazing what this person put on Facebook."
"After eight years in seclusion, Batman resurfaces to face Bane, a mastermind bent on destroying Gotham and has ties to Bruce Wayne's past. Christopher Nolan's conclusion to his Dark Knight trilogy should be treated as a wrap up rather than a third installment. Despite many new characters being introduced, even their conflicts and motives are derived from events that occurred in the previous two films. Such an approach could be seen as a weakness, since the conflict could just end up being sort of a rematch rather than moving the story forward; however, Nolan's approach works terrificly. Over an hour is shot in stunning IMAX, but the film is more touching than it is intense and that's its best quality. Hardy steps in as the genius mercenary Bane, who is slightly bigger, slightly stronger and slightly smarter than Batman, thus making him a challenge best suited for the grand finale. The Joker works best as Batman's arch-nemesis since they are polar opposites, with The Joker standing for everything Batman stands against. Two-Face works best as Batman's most tragic enemy because Harvey Dent is very much like Bruce Wayne the only difference is: Dent copes with his tragedy through revenge rather than seeking justice as Wayne did. Bane works best as Batman's most challenging villain because of his physical and mental superiority—forget the Bane you saw in ""BATMAN & ROBIN"". Nolan carefully chose all his villains in the series wisely and executed them perfectly. Hardy had big shoes to fill following Ledger's posthumous Oscar winning performance; while Bane is no Joker, Hardy does a satisfying job and should not be compared to Ledger's performance as they are completely different roles. It is Michael Caine, however, that delivers the most memorable and touching performance of the entire film. A wonderful conclusion to a wonderful trilogy.

"The Dark Knight Rises was a perfect sequel to a masterpiece. Christopher Nolan took a different direction and focused more on Bruce Wayne/Batman. This movie is filled with lots of emotions. It has such great characters and of course the dialogs is so good. The performances are incredible. It was my most anticipated movie of the century. The more I watch it, The more epic it gets. Personally, I think The Dark Knight Trilogy is the greatest Trilogy of all time and this movie gives the greatest ending of all time in the movie history. I remember seeing it thrice and the more I watched It the more respect it earns. Thank you Christopher Nolan, You Sir Are A Master."
"Possibly my personal favourite of the Nolan Batman films, and I do like Batman Begins and The Dark Knight very much. Is it perfect? For me, not quite, there are so many plot strand in a long running time that the film occasionally(and there is a big emphasis on that) sags in momentum and some of the strands in the ending could have done with more development. It is a brilliant film all the same, one of the highlights so far of the year. As to expect from Christopher Nolan, it is a visually audacious film, with gorgeous cinematography, a beautifully realised Gotham City and great special effects. Hans Zimmer's score is not one of his very best for me, but there is still an epic and haunting quality that is just perfect for this film. The dialogue provokes thought and makes an emotional impact, and a vast majority of the time The Dark Knight Rises is ambitious and gripping. I don't consider Christopher Nolan one of my favourites, this said he is a hugely impressive director who shows great ambition and a willingness to make his subject matters interesting. He does a really wonderful job here, as the set/action pieces including the plane hijack and Bane's assault on Gotham are enough to make the jaw drop. The performances are just terrific from all involved, Matthew Modine fares weakest but he is far from bad. Christian Bale is still a charismatic presence, Matthew Caine appropriately loyal and Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman subtly understated. Joseph Gordon Levitt captures his character's idealism wonderfully. Tom Hardy is in beefed-up terrifying mode as Bane, a worthy successor to Heath Ledger's iconic Joker. Anne Hathaway was a curious casting choice, but as Catwoman she is spot on, here is a Catwoman who actually does much more than acting sexy(which she still is), she is very ruthless and no-nonsense here. All in all, a hugely impressive film, the best of Nolan's Batman trilogy- though I'm prepared for any flaming I'll get for this opinion- and one of the highlights so far of 2012. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"There's a storm coming .....

Years after being villified, Batman is encouraged once again to come Gotham's aid, as it's in the grip of a group of mercenaries run by the villainous Bane.

First of all, you don't have to be a superhero fan to enjoy this great movie, it truly does have the most broad appeal, there's something here for everyone to enjoy. If you liked the two preceding films, I figure you'll love this one, I'm a fan of all three, this is my personal favourite.

It's a long movie, but it flies by at a canter, no single frame is wasted, it moves by at a terrific pace, it has incredible action sequences, but the story is terrific.

It's really interesting to see Batman coming in from a position where he's decided and feared, he's no longer accepted as Gotham's hero and saviour.

Christian Bale is the perfect Batman, and he is matched every step of the way by Tom Hardy. Hardy is off the charts as Bane, the last time we saw the character was back in The Batman and Robin film, perhaps best forgotten, here though he's an iconic villain.

I can't speak highly enough of Bale and Hardy, but this is also, I think the best of Anne Hathaway, she is excellent here.

A decade on, and this film is still fabulous.

10/10."
"Christopher Nolan's epic trilogy concludes in glorious fashion and gives us a thought provoking and suitably satisfying conclusion to an epic saga. It's emotional, intense and has a great villain in Tom Hardy."
"Not being a huge fan of superhero movies, I didn't have much expectations for Batman Begins. However viewing the 2005 Christopher Nolan production, I was pleasantly shocked. Then after my huge expectations for, ""The Dark Knight"", Christopher Nolan blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, ""The Dark Knight Rises""? Quite simply, Yes! My big expectations were once again, blown away. What a production! This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The editing, sound, score, visuals, direction and action are all top notch.

The film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Christian Bale, of course still makes is a great Batman. Michael Cain is fantastic, as he always is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be considered for an Oscar nomination. Tom Hardy as Bane is utterly terrifying, at times, and completely ominous. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman/Selina Kyle is a scene stealer. She is completely engrossing. Everyone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors are so well done, so well written, and so well directed. The Dark Knight Rises is is emotionally riveting and amazing to view.

At a running time of almost 3 hours, the film never becomes dull, which is pretty impressive. The movie's action sequences are spectacularly well created and very intense. The dialogue between the character's are intelligent and highly believable. The movie's soundtrack is terrific and really exemplify's many of the movie's scenes. Extremely well editing and sound use really develop many of the movie's action scenes, so it's not just explosions and visuals like in many other movies. Nolan creates a grand, dirty, engrossing world, and his action sequences just hum.

In conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that great writing and direction can enhance any movie-going experience, even superhero movies, which are usually thought of as mindless entertainment. I am wholly satisfied with Christopher Nolan's vision and thank all who worked on this film for bringing such an intricate interpretation of its very famous literary source. I cannot recommend this film anymore than I have, I just have to say everyone and anyone should see it. 10/10"""
"I think as a film stand point, the dark knight is a better movie that is better acted and tense the whole way through. The dark knight rises to me is a more fun and action filled movie that you can sit back a bit more. The acting is still amazing and combined with the atmosphere/visuals of the movie creates a the sense of realism that the movie has. That realism is where the intensity stems from throughout the movie, the audience believing that something like this could actually happen makes it that much scarier. Bane is also an excellent villain, in the dark knight the joker challenges Batman mentally but Bane physically challenges him which is a completely new challenge for Batman. The plot is incredible, it it starts fast and instantly brings you into the action. It then takes a step back to develop the characters further and build up the challenge Batman has to face. Once one of the many challenges was overcome by Batman in launches the viewer straight back into action for one epic final battle that lasts almost an hour......and it is GLORIOUS! Not one second was I bored, it is truly incredible how each movie in the trilogy is this good, it shouldn't be possible. I've not even mentioned the incredible soundtrack to compliment the astounding yet grounded action. I can't compliment this movie enough. If you haven't someone seen this trilogy yet....watch it, you won't be disappointed."
"I came out with slight disappointment after watching DKR for I had huge expectations from Nolan after an exceptional TDK.

I am huge fan of first two installment of Batman Trilogy. I liked DKR, it's a good movie, but it could have been much better.

So rather than discussing its merit, which are many, I am pointing out its shortcomings.

It's the weaker than other movies of trilogy and simple reason being it lacks strong characters. DKR is all about storytelling, just like Nolan's Inception, but not as efficient. And in doing so, it fails where Batman Begins and The Dark Knight had succeeded.

Batman Begins was all about fear, doubt, self-realization and redemption where Bruce Wayne discovers his destiny as Batman. BB had a story arc which set background for main characters - Batman / Wayne, Ra's al Ghul, Gordon (to some extent) and most importantly Gothom City and hence set stage for a fitting climax.

The Dark Knight explores the theme of chaos, morality and belief effortlessly and establishes characters of Joker, Harvey Dent/Two Face, Rachel etc. So effortlessly that people choose to ignore even some major plot holes. Heath Ledger's interpretation of Joker was so mesmerizing that it single handily carried TDK to path of greatness/ critical acclaim.

But Dark Knight Rises is all about story telling - efficient but not exceptional. Bane, Miranda Tate, John Blake, Peter Folly (Deputy Commissioner), Selina Kyle - characters are introduced but never explored/ expanded - they just start working on their part - just like cogs in the wheel. They are not so much part of the story itself but just the agents which move the story forward.

Bane's character is dull and single dimensional and do not evoke any fear or awe. He's meticulous, intelligent and strong and this is established quickly in movie but after that he slumps into a just another movie villain. Taila / Miranda character is never fully explored. Even Wayne/Batman is devoid of any emotions in this one and he feels so sure of himself that I start wondering if it's the same Batman that I saw in first two installments. Only new character which had some shades was that of Selina Kyle and Anne Hathaway did justice to it. Add to that helplessness of Alfred portrayed superbly by Caine. Other actors are good but there's not much for them to do.

There's no dilemma, choices, moral battles, hope, chaos or fear - things that make characters and plot interesting and which made Batman Begins and The Dark Knight really good movies. Even the theme of ""Occupy WallStreet"" is very weak and, at best, is closer to London riots with its looting and arson. There's even perfect order in Bane's revolution. Movie moves effortlessly from one plot to another and to climax that it become at times predictable.

But maybe Dark Knight Rises was supposed to be like that only and Nolan had too much to deal with in 2.5 hours. And maybe that's the main problem with DKR - too much is going on in the story that it seems crammed at times. And when there are too many characters and so many story arcs, it's tough to do justice to characters and story telling at the same time.

Dark Knight Rises have a good story but lacks strong characters and relies on Inception's style which incidentally differs from style of first two installments of Batman Trilogy.

And for me, soul of Nolan's Batman Series is its strong characters, their underlying emotions and a theme which is much deeper and meaningful than all fight, gadgetry and style. And this is where DKR fails.

6/10."
"Christopher Nolan has outdone himself with this one. At 3.30 in the morning, I was tired. Just getting out of it, I've never been so awake.

Perhaps what set this film apart from his other films was that it had a genuine emotional heartbeat. I felt that this was a flaw of Nolan's other films - the vision of emotion was there, but it was hollow. In this I bought it. I felt it, hero and villain alike.

Christian Bale was typically brilliant as Batman, and I felt that Bruce Wayne was more heavily embraced in this final installment. Bale added emotional depth to the character - a plot point that I think went astray in The Dark Knight - picking up from the development made in Batman Begins.

Tom Hardy as Bane was quite simply, terrifying. No longer a dunderhead ""enforcer"", but one of the criminal masterminds behind ""Gotham's Reckoning"", coupled with a physical dominance strong enough to send shivers down your spine.

Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle defied my expectations. Hands up who was not entirely convinced that that girl from the Princess Diaries could handle an intensely physical role like Catwoman. But here I am, hugely impressed. She added immeasurably to the value of the film.

Marion Cotillard fulfilled the role of Miranda Tate admirably, though I suspect this was the most underdeveloped character of the film - though after watching, I can see why.

The unsung hero of The Dark Knight Rises is Michael Caine as Alfred. A heartfelt performance that helps drive the emotional content of the film, helping Nolan sell his most well-rounded film to date. Caine's performance in both presence and absence.

Special mention goes to Joseph Gordon Levitt, who is consistently proving himself to be a big player in the Hollywood game. His role as officer Blake felt like there could've been more, but it may just have come all a bit much. It was a great performance, and Levitt sunk his teeth into role.

If you can, go see this in IMAX. If any film was to sell the format to skeptics, The Dark Knight Rises would be IT. I'm happy Nolan stuck to his guns and shot in 2D. 3D would have been unnecessary.

I suppose at this point, I have to turn my focus on Nolan. If he ever reads this... aspiring filmmaker to filmmaker, I've never been so envious, jealous in all my life. It's a film that leaves me floundering, wondering what I could possibly do to get anywhere near this ballpark. Well done. I think an Oscar Nomination is in order.

From here, I'm not sure what to expect of the future. Does our imagination carry us forward, or do the studios? Time will tell.

"I had the honor of watching TDKR during a screening and was completely blown away! Christopher Nolan's third film in his Batman trilogy doesn't disappoint. The movie is incredibly well made, its huge production is quite breathtaking to view. This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The movie's score high-lites many of its incredible scenes, and at times, it takes your breath away.

The film featured excellent performances, by all the cast. Christian Bale, as always is great as Batman. Anne Hathaway was completely engrossing, she became ""Catwoman"", just like Michele Pfeiffer did, although their interpretations were very different, both were equally effective. Tom Hardy was the main villain ""Bane"" completely shattered my expectations. One of the best superhero movie villains, I've ever seen. The terror caused by him, is completely believable and quite menacing. Marlion Cotilliard, Michael Cane, Gary Oldman, and others all did well in their respective roles. Now I know most will miss Heath Ledger as the Joker.(I know I do) I hope people don't compare Tom Hardy's performance to Heath Ledger's, its completely unfair and the two characters are very different. Just read the comics.

The colossal size of the film is a spectacle to behold, but surprisingly you don't get lost with all the explosions and extravagant action scenes, like in other films,(AKA Transformers, or POTC.) If one were to gripe, and I suppose there will never be a film made that one cannot find a point at which to grip, it is painfully long running time here. I found myself more worried about the pain in my posterior than the emotional final minutes after almost 3 hours that I had spent in a cramped seat, but that's just how I am. However the ending is just fantastic, so emotional and bring the trilogy to a very satisfying end.

Sorry if I'm being all fan-boyish and kissing this movie's behind, but I really admire it. It may not be among my personal favorites but generally this seems to be the movie event of this year. As a film though, this is amazing. A true lasting legacy in superhero story telling and summer-blockbusters."
"The best thing about this movie is how satisfying it is. It doesn't leave you frustrated or confused. You can't really complain that it didn't explore certain ideas or follow through. By deciding to have an official ending to this trilogy's story, the themes surrounding Batman are very fresh. We don't know where he'll end up. It's not the same old thing about whether he can continue to be Batman or not, which was already getting repetitive in Spider-man 2. The conclusions are not as important as the feelings they invoke as they come about. Nolan is especially good at capturing the complete tension of actually not knowing what will happen and deeply questioning what you *want* to happen and why.

This movie is bigger than the previous two, far more ambitious. There are no obvious annoying weaknesses that usually come with films in general, especially blockbuster action movies. All of Nolan's movies have deep psychological themes and this takes those in another new direction. I thought Inception was hugely original and insightful about the way people think. That level of abstraction and depth is present in this film. Bane bursts into it, his reputation is quickly established. Nolan uses people's expectations and anticipation to the fullest. We are left to wonder about what has happened in the 8 years since the events of The Dark Knight. Why have the characters become the way they are now?

In the latter half, it does seem like the movie is trying to pull off so many different plot points and connections, but they all work. The cast is very large and impressive. You don't see ""good acting"". You see fascinating characters. They're just playing their part in the grand story that's being crafted. There are many unfamiliar faces but they all have a strange, unique look to them. We often see a person's flaws and previous decisions coming back to haunt them. They find out the hard way what mistakes they have made. Where their limits are. Where they lose control.

The score is almost tribal, very raw and energetic. You don't get much chance to pay attention to it but many parts of the movie are pounding with excitement. There are countless quotable lines and disturbing slices of dialogue. They cut deep. The Joker was a great character and this is a very different movie but the themes are just as dark, only perhaps indirectly. Underneath, it's very sinister. Writing and efficiency appear to be among Nolan's greatest strengths. The story has many layers that interweave and apparently they came in under budget.

Perhaps the most important thing about Catwoman is that she's completely believable. When she beats up men, you don't roll your eyes. She's feminine and powerful in her own way. She fits into the world and we completely understand her motivations. She doesn't have a huge role but a very important one.

I didn't find myself moved but maybe I'm too cynical. I was more affected psychologically. Curious about humanity and all the different sides of it you see in this movie. It goes to many extremes. I felt humbled by my complete lack of life experience. What do I know about anything? How could I possibly understand half of the characters? I haven't been through anything or achieved anything compared to most of them. Michael Caine gets a bigger role this time. He was always critical but this time he's very much the emotional core.

I thought Christian Bale was overlooked in The Dark Knight especially. The movies hinge on him. Bruce Wayne's just a man but also incredibly inspirational. Bale's famous for completely committing to his roles and it pays off. Tom Hardy is impressive as Bane but I suppose that's no surprise. The rest of the leads are similarly awesome. There are many references to the earlier films. Very few questions are left unanswered. It's always nice when film-makers really think it through and make an actual decision and get all the details right.

So anyway, I'll miss Batman (since the trilogy has ended) but couldn't have hoped for a better, more epic and sincere finale to his story."
"The Batman series by Christopher Nolan was and is probably one of the best superhero series ever. In an industry where very few sequels have been that good, The Dark Knight, I believe was designed by Christopher Nolan to be head and shoulders above Batman Begins; and it was. The Dark Knight surpassed Batman Begins, end of story. Now that you have accomplished what very few have managed, how do you surpass this one. A daunting and mountainous task indeed. Only now, Nolan wasn't even trying to surpass it. He was merely trying to present a movie that would build on its predecessor.

The movie is set 8 years after the Joker incident so that anything related to the Joker need not be shown (RIP Heath Ledger). Nolan presents us a completely different Gotham. A different take on it. And how 8 years can change people. How the harvey dent and joker incident can affect people and batman himself. In a time of peace, it is quite easy to plan and attack even an entire city. Everything is taken into concern. And it all adds up to one seemingly invincible villain. The logic is never lost at any point of time. The screenplay is penned to allow the impact of what has happened to Gotham and its people in ""The Dark Knight"" and what could happen if something goes wrong now.

All things said, if you are expecting something better than The Dark Knight, you are mistaken. This was never going to compete or surpass that. This is a very good movie in its own right. As for the series, there cannot be a better conclusion and I really hope nobody else continues this series if Nolan decides not to.

TDKR needs to be appreciated for staying true to its roots and still giving us something good, exhilarating and unexpected."
"There are plenty of elements that made this film work, so I suppose we can tick them off one by one. For starters, the continuation on the focus of Bruce Wayne's story, which has made it all tick. This version of Bruce Wayne and Alfred become the familiar characters we're accustomed with since 2005, and the film invests heavily on the emotional bonding between the two, which deals back to the theme about fear that rears its ugly head again, and how a father figure cannot stand idly by to watch the one he brought up recklessly charge into battle after a long hiatus, and hoping for a life of normalcy with the mantle of the bat given up. Michael Caine may have a shorter screen time than before, but no less powerful.

When Sam Raimi had to put the popular and powerful Venom into Spider-man 3 pretty much against his wishes, we all knew how that turned out to be, effectively killing off the franchise until the decision to reboot it. There may be some similar fears with the introduction of a fairly contemporary villain in Bane, but the story gave him more purpose and meaning, and Tom Hardy was excellent par none in this role as the compete villain - with plenty of brawn, merciless, masterful, and with a plan any terrorist would be proud of. If the Scarecrow meant to induce fear, and the Joker to create chaos, Bane is carnage incarnate. Tom Hardy, even being the requisite mask, is fearful, and while the designs of his plan may dwarf the Joker's in complexity, it sure rivaled his in terms of delivery, and execution. Anyone in his path gets shoved aside with deadly consequences, and anyone alive is only because there is of further use. No hesitation, and no compromise.

And Nolan continues with the introduction of a lot more villains big and small, behind a mask or otherwise, in his Bat films than anyone would credit him for, especially when having those whose lines are blurred, or corrupt to the core and hiding behind social status and fortune. This in turn provides for another arc that boils underneath the main narrative, where the rich and powerful continue to enjoy their successes at the expense of the have-nots, and the Occupy Movement in a way being a very real parallel to the proceedings on screen. While the mobsters were clearly at the top of the food chain in the earlier Nolan films, this one shifted focus to politicians and the elite community, with their fair share of scandals and corporate greed.

While Bane was to the point, Selina Kyle played by Anne Hathaway, is both sensual and a force to be reckoned with herself, being like how she's best portrayed, on the fence. There's a bit of Frank Miller's Year One in this one given the presence of Juno Temple's Holly, and the back to basics as a jewel thief, compared to the mousy secretary in Tim Burton's Batman Returns with Michelle Pfeiffer defining the role, and the garbage that was Halle Berry's. Anne Hathaway nailed this one with what would be a truly memorable outing, and as if a homage of sorts to Burton's second Batman film, that the repartee between Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle at a party became one of the highlights here, as does her thievery and combat ability. She may lack her whip, but more than makes up for it with her steel stiletto heels, and the very sensual and sleekly designed feline moves that you'd wonder how they got delivered while wrapped under that skin tight suit.

And not only is the technology put on screen fictionally impressive, the technical aspects behind the scenes also worked wonders, chalking up serious mileage in having more than an hour's worth of footage shot on the IMAX format. Wally Pfister's cinematography continues to impress with that staying consistent to the gritty look and feel developed for all the Bat films to date, before his departure into a film director's role for his next project. Hans Zimmer also probably developed the best score for Nolan's Bat films, and I dare say without which this film would be less stellar, with the score playing a huge role in adding plenty of character and emotion to the film, lifting it up with excitement during the many set action pieces, with recognizable themes assigned to major players, heightening dangers, and providing a boost to the many feelings in this one heck of an action-adventure.

With how things developed at the end, and what I felt was initial horror of sorts with Batman out in broad daylight, secret identity being porous and all, this film ended in what would be the best way possible - with possibilities, and a twinkle of an eye, Inception style with a did it, or did it not. Twists, turns, surprises and sleight of hand, making it a clear favourite as one of the best this year. Do yourself a favour and watch it in the IMAX format, just as it was intended.

Because you have just got to believe in Christopher Nolan, and the kind of films he has so far delivered. Take a bow, bat-crew, for a trilogy that has now set the bar for any comic book film, and especially any other follow Batman movie, reboot or otherwise, to live up to."
"I'm going to start off by saying that this was probably one of my most anticipated movies of all time. I went in the theater hoping for a masterpiece. I actually expected this movie to jump into my top five of all time. It didn't disappoint, I loved it.

The opening scene had me questioning what exactly was going on. Movies that make you think about the smallest details of the plot are my favorite. In the scene the audience is introduced to the new villain, Bane. As a kid watching cartoons I always thought that bane was a mindless hulk-like bad guy. In this movie he has a true to the comic's portrayal. He's smart, he has a plan, and he'll stop at nothing to put it into action. Much like Dark Knight, the Villain is a major standout. He has such an intimidating presence on screen. Tom Hardy put so much work into the physicality of the character. The first fight between Bane and Batman is one of the moments that they had to get right. Luckily it's one of my favorite moments in the entire film! In the scene they don't use too much sound, just Bane's taunts as he fights, truly frightening. His voice is so interesting. It's something you'll really remember about the film. After the film my friends and I couldn't help but do Bane impressions. He has so many quotable lines that he will probably be one of my favorite villains of all time. You might be wondering if he outperformed the Joker from Dark Knight. The answer is no, not quite. He's so different of a character it's hard to compare, but Joker was just too hard to beat. Christian Bale's performance as Batman and Bruce Wayne was amazing. This was easily his best performance as Batman. The story takes place eight years after the end of Dark Knight so Bruce is feeling the ill effects of being batman. He uses a cane now, and he has a little grey hair. This is a story about Bruce Wayne coming back, and doing anything he can for his city. Bruce and Alfred have some amazing scenes where you forget your watching acting. The emotion they both convey when they're together is stunning. Michel Cane doesn't have as much screen time as he does in the other movies, but he's so good in the ones he's in you won't forget his performance. Morgan Freeman is back. He has some particularly funny scenes with Bruce. They feel like old friends yet again. You really can't go wrong with any of the actors in this movie. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays young police officer Blake. He has some great character development during the course of the movie. I was cheering for him the whole time. If you come out of this movie saying ""I just wish it had better acting"" I'd question your sanity. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman was one big worry I had about the movie going in. Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised. She did a great job of portraying the playful vigilante. She actually had okay chemistry with Christian Bale. Catwoman wasn't forced into the story, her character made sense within the plot. She didn't ruin the movie, which was all I was asking for. Plus, she actually looked like she could fight. She wasn't doing the ""I'm a woman who can beat up ten men with one hand tied behind my back"" routine. It was such a relief that they didn't try to do something annoying like Black Widow from Avengers.

The story was fantastic. It's amazing that Christopher Nolan wasn't planning on doing this movie before he made Batman Begins. There are so many callbacks and references to that movie I would strongly recommend watching that one again before you see this one. I kept saying ""Oh I remember when he said that!"" or thinking ""That ties in perfectly"". This one had plenty of twists and turns. Multiple times I was questioning what was true and what was a clever ruse. If there are any negatives, you might say there are some plot leaps. Not holes mind you, but something upon thinking about it you might consider a little unbelievable. With such huge story and scope I'm surprised there aren't more mistakes. The scale of this movie is far bigger than in either of the first two Batman movies. Bane has a plan for all of Gotham and batman has to stop an entire city of villains. The entire trilogy comes to a very fitting finish. I absolutely loved the ending. I was very satisfied how everything tied together. I especially loved the conclusion of Bruce's story, perfect. When I came out of the theater I couldn't wait to discuss the amazing things that happened in the end. This is a movie where the more you watch it the more you'll understand and enjoy it.

Of course, in the conclusion to a trilogy like this one you would expect to be dazzled by the special effects. They were quite impressive. The new batwing has some pretty amazing aerial maneuvers. You definitely get your money's worth with the cinematography. The opening and ending scenes especially stand out. There was an extremely cool Bat Pod driving scene that, as soon as it was over, I wanted to watch it again.

It can't tell you enough that this was an amazing movie. It was certainly the best of the year. If you're wondering if it's better than The Dark Knight I honestly can't say. Time will tell. It could be better, and that's some of the highest praise I can give it.

Edit: Time did tell. It didn't hold up. Still good. Nowhere near Dark Knight tkubas1.wordpress.com."
"'The Dark Knight Rises' is the third and final instalment in Christopher Nolan's groundbreaking trilogy that reshaped the superhero genre as we know it. The main cast return as well as some newcomers. Tom Hardy as 'Bane', Anne Hathaway as 'Selina', Joseph Gordon-Levitt as 'Blake' and Marion Cotillard as 'Miranda'. The new additions are fantastic, especially Tom Hardy. He brings a menacing presence to the character and finally incorporates the main part of his comic counterpart, his brains. For sure Bane is incredibly strong, but he is also an unbelievable strategist that can systematically wear down Batman whilst also using his strength to defeat him. Hardy displays all of this perfectly despite us barely seeing his face, the mask he wears makes him more frightening and is used as an interesting plot device later in the film. A lot of people criticised the voice that Hardy uses for this character, but personally I love it, I think adds to the mystery of the figure. The best acting comes from Michael Caine as 'Alfred Pennyworth'. Nolan really fleshes out Alfred and Bruce's relationship in this film and Caine plays the reluctant mentor figure perfectly. One of his final scenes really shows off his acting, the regret that Alfred pours out and it's heartbreaking. Whilst all of the other actors are great, Caine excels in this movie compared to 'Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight'. The writing is brilliant, so many twists and turns and a sensational ending that really brings the trilogy full circle and has a great ending to Bruce's arc. The dialogue is excellent, in particular the many Bane monologues that add another layer onto his great character. The fight choreography improves massively and is loads better than the last two films. Hanz Zimmers score is superb and works in all scenes that it features in. Also, the cinematography is beautiful, Wally Pfister, who has worked with Nolan throughout the trilogy, really peaks in this picture. However, this movie isn't perfect, Bane's final demise is very underwhelming, especially for a character that makes as much of an impact as he does. Finally the twist at the end with Blake feels tacked on and is inaccurate to the source material. Overall, I love this movie, for sure it doesn't live up to the heights of 'The Dark Knight' but it is still exceptional and was a stunning way to end this unbelievable series of films.

"Let me start by saying, that I am an avid Nolan admirer. Up until now I haven't seen a bad Nolan film. All of his movies would be in my top movies list if I had one, I consider him a genius. After seeing the final act of his Batman I have started to reconsider.

The movie was filled with moments where I found myself thinking ""This is not believable"" and after the first hour I asked myself ""Is this it?"". Gladly after the first hour things did become more meaningful. The ""fall"" of the dark knight was awesome, Bane was a tough guy and the Batman did suffer. It was great. Even Anne Hathaway came trough crushing all my negative preconceptions. Other than that, the movie certainly didn't deliver.

In the end they ruined Banes character. Batman's training in this film was far from believable. There were lot of little stories and story structures going on, which didn't work when added together. I mean they worked but comparing to the previous films of Nolan they certainly did not deliver. In many scenes I thought ""This is something that just could not happen"", the things in this film just didn't work. And I don't mean Batman doing his stunts, of course they are unrealistic, I mean all the little things that left me bothered.

On the other hand when it comes to Batman's stunts there were little, the end conclusion left me thinking ""was this the great finale of BATMAN?"". Isn't Batman supposed to do something cooler than fly a plane or ride a motorcycle? Isn't Batman supposed to be an acrobat who beats everyone in a cool, cunning and mysterious ways? Here he was the operator of an army plane. In the previous films he was Batman, in this film he doesn't really come off as Batman. His only a random commando wearing a Batman suit. This is something I could not forgive Nolan for.

If the scenes we're actually believable I would've propably considered forgiving him this error, but these two errors together are just too much for me to say this is an impressive movie. You might be able to go as far to say this is good, but it is not impressive. This is a shame, because the guy who did this has done nothing but impressive movies. For some other director this movie could be a good stepping stone for something better, an acceptable movie that did have its moments, but for Nolan it is an utter failure. There we're times in this movie when he got me and I was impressed. The movie did in certain scenes raise my emotion and hit me where it should've, but as a whole taking into account all the bad things it cannot be regarded as a movie above others.

I was let down with this movie. With all of his previous movies that I have seen in the theathre I have gone in with enormous expectations, like the kind of hyped mind you should never walk in with and every single time I have walked out with my expectations blown away by the grandness of what I have just seen. This time I walked in with the same expectations and came out disappointed. The only question in my mind being ""How was he able to not see these flaws in this movie, I thought he was a genius who could not fail""."
"This movie shows that despite failure, despite your fears, despite your enemies, you can be a hero. you can use all three of those things to your advantage and become something better than you were before you encountered them. it masterfully shows and tells that ANYONE can be a hero.

obviously on a technical level this film is perfect. almost the entirety of the third act is shot in beautiful imax, that's sadly only in 16:9 on 4K. just like with the previous transfers, sound and picture are great, but this is probably the best looking film to me.

it may not seem like it at first, but just like ra's and joker, bane is the opposite side of the same coin for batman. tom hardy perfectly embodies bane and the darkness, and obviously he's a downgrade from joker, but that doesn't mean he's not the perfect villain for a finale.

hans zimmer delivers probably my third favorite score from him, with an incredible theme for bane as well as many extensions of previous themes.

this is such an underrated finale. all three films mesh together so well, they feel like one. they mean so much to me, and i'll forever thank nolan for making these films."
"I've always loved superhero movies and as a kid Batman was my favourite superhero and I collected as many of the comic books as I could possibly afford.

Saying that I've never expected a superhero movie to be between the best genres of movies that I would ever watch. I just expect them to be entertaining and something fun to watch. I watch most of them; Superman, Spiderman, Ironman, X-men etc.

I expected the same this time but I was knocked off my feet. The actors, the storyline, the manuscript and the filming just came together as one of the best movies I've ever seen. This movie has really brilliant and powerful dialogues.

If you haven't seen it yet then I can strongly recommend it. I will definitely see it again with a good bottle of wine and popcorn. Enjoy!"
"Christopher Nolan's stunning conclusion to his Batman trilogy is a welcome return to form after the slightly overrated THE DARK KNIGHT, which was so obsessed with being all dark and brooding that it forgot to tell much of a story. Despite the presence of a much-hyped (and lamented) Heath Ledger in the cast, I found that film to be less entertaining than BATMAN BEGINS although it still remains an engaging and watchable film. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES (horrible title, by the way), though, blows it out of the water, offering a piece of sheer spectacle that's as involving and as tightly-plotted as you could wish for.

It's eight years since the last film, and Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne is nowadays retired and definitely feeling his age. Before long, though, a hulking brute of a bad guy (Tom Hardy, whose sheer physicality in the role will surprise nobody who's seen Bronson) decides to do some very unpleasant things in the city, so it's time to dust off the bat suit and get back into the action. Good news for the viewer.

As usual, Nolan surpasses the conventions of his genre, making this a superhero film that looks nothing like a superhero film, instead more like a modern-day epic of dramatic cinema. Yes, at the end of the day it's still about suited guys beating the hell out of each other, and Nolan once again relies on old conventions/clichés (such as the 'ticking bomb' trope, which he's repeated in his last three films now) to see him through, but everyone runs so well and so smoothly that you end up not minding.

The cast is thorough and involved as ever, Bale as usual going the extra mile to portray the tortured hero and Caine lending emotional support as Alfred. Hardy's villain is a sheer powerhouse who dominates every scene he's in, and Nolan brings back a couple of his favourites from INCEPTION (Marion Cotillard and Joseph Gordon-Levitt) for good measure. There's not quite as much action as you might expect from a film of this type, but the storyline is so involved that you don't care. Throw plenty of stunning special effects into the mix and you have a real crowd-pleaser of a film with real brain as well as brawn."
"Chris Nolan has r-e-a-l-l-y outdone himself again this time. An amazing story that I don't even know who else could write such a treatment on the World's Greatest Detective, the crowning glory of Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy.

I remember I once made a joke to myself a long while ago about him that if he was going to make another movie, he would probably cast Heath Ledger and Joseph Gordon-Levitt's respective love interests from a movie of which they BOTH starred in and worked on-- 10 Things I Hate About You.

It would be ironically funny how both actors are connected to each other from working at different times with the ""holy-moly mind-blowing"" filmmaker and that the actresses that played their love interests would possibly too as well."
"I'll be brutally honest here. I liked The Dark Knight better than this. Even though its just couple of hours since I finished watching it.

Sure, TDK had its flaws, but then, it was such a marvelous noir saga, a treatise in crime drama that left us begging for more at the end. The phrase ""page-turner"" is often applied to engrossing books, but that could work just as well for the magnificent film. To this day, I cannot take my eyes off whenever I see TDK and by the time that ravishing interrogation scene between Batman and Joker is on, nothing is likely to stir me from my seat. By choosing to make the titular character undergo a perception shift, a massive (and ultimately successful) gamble was taken. And who can forget the late, great Heath Ledger's spectacular performance?

TDKR is not a bad movie per se. Seen alone, it has the ideal ingredients for a summer blockbuster: an A-list cast, monumental action sequences, modern themes of terrorism and official ineptitude, as well as intricate sub-plots which mesh well together at the end. There is more than a passing reference to the predecessors, especially Batman Begins (which, in my humble opinion, is an enormously underrated flick). And it works to a great extent.

Where this film fails as TDK succeeded is in the amount of layering. Some sub-plots were so complex that I was left confused as to where I was before that particular sequence (case in point: Blake's impromptu reconnaissance of a dockyard). Others were left frustratingly hanging in thin air. The plot also seems slow paced at first. While the first sequence is downright awesome, what follows afterward is distinctly underwhelming. Above all else, Batman is renowned to be a master strategist. Here, he ends up getting deceived not once, but twice at Catwoman's hands. You mean to tell me that eight years is good enough to make a superbly trained, marine-worthy, genius escape artist-cum-detective become dull? Really?

I won't go ahead and slate Nolan more here, simply because he gave me the privilege of watching two of the best superhero movies ever filmed in Batman Begins and TDK. The glass is always half-full in my eyes, and I'll admit that Hathaway and Gordon-Levitt were both perfect selections for their roles. I'm not too sure of Tom Hardy, since his performance is more physical than metaphorical but given his task was to exude a ruthless menace, he did his job. The rest of the familiar supporting cast are brilliant as before, especially with Caine showing his human side that we always suspected was well alive beneath that stiff British upper lip exterior and dry wit. I read somewhere that this is not a Batman movie, but a Bruce Wayne movie. And I fully agree. Having to reconcile (with unflattering results) with a life without Batman, Bruce is alone even as a social presence and a corporate figure. It is a true challenge but then again, Christian Bale turned in a remarkable performance in both BB and TDK (he held his own in those scenes where Ledger was not present). And in TDKR, he leaves an indelible mark on a role that would probably be the benchmark.

Batman Begins was all about ""Fear"" while ""Chaos"" was a running theme in TDK. TDKR does a great job in being a conclusion to the trilogy, but it is not the best one among the three, probably because there is no strong undercurrent of a theme here."
"I am a huge fan of Christopher Nolan and the first 2 Dark Knight movies, so I had high expectations for this movie. The Dark Knight Rises is good, but it is nowhere near the level of the other two movies. It has several things that are a bit cliché and it also had several plot holes that I found very irritating and distracting. My friend who I saw it with initially thought it was the best out of the trilogy, but after we discussed the plot holes that he missed, he ranked it as the worst of the three movies. Throughout the movie I felt like everything was a bit overdone. It seemed like they were trying so hard to make the ""epic conclusion"" that they forgot to make it realistic or reasonable. One of the things I loved about the first two was how it dealt with Batman in a fairly realistic way. There was a fairly good overview of how he functioned and how he was viewed. In this I thought there was much less dealing with the separation of Bruce Wayne and Batman, which was one of the interesting parts of the first 2. Also, I would describe the main character of The Dark Knight Rises as Bruce Wayne rather than Batman, which I found greatly disappointing. Still a good movie, but not nearly as great as the first 2."
"-Minor Spoilers- First of all, why hate so much? The movie is not perfect, agreed. It's not the best movie ever, again agreed. However it's one of the best movies, and it's pretty damn good, even if it's not perfect. The plot is good, the action is good, cast is great, acting is great too, and the atmosphere the movie creates is fantastic! Ignore all the hate, and please go enjoy the film. And I don't understand, why are people comparing this movie to TDK? They're by the same director and they're part of the same trilogy, no comparison. TDK is too perfect, and we all know that. So why did ya all have your expectations sky high. Whenever a director releases a movie which is near-perfect, then it is hard for him/her to beat that movie. Sure he/she can make a movie equal to the other one, but to beat it, think again. Thus my expectations for TDKR were high, but not sky high. And guess what? It crossed my expectations, and it was really close to TDK. Tremendous film!

Lately I haven't developed an interest in comic book reading, and I really don't enjoy batman or to be honest I don't enjoy much of superhero films at all. Only a few. However I didn't only enjoy this movie as a superhero film, I also enjoyed it itself as a movie. The reason I don't watch many superhero films is because they're very tedious and repetitive, and there's no message. Here is how your everyday superhero film goes ""There is ""Whatever"" man. Some stupid person attempts to outsmart the _____man, and take over the city, and guess what? He fails, and ______ man gets respect for saving the city...the end"". TDKR was out of the ordinary. To be honest, the whole trilogy was ""Out of the box"" thinking, especially this and TDK. Both this and TDK made it to my Top 10 films of all-time, and many movies at this time don't even make it close.

The movie did have its problems as well, it was not perfect. One of the major concerns was the time. The movie had a near-3hr run time which was more than enough. There were some slow and boring parts at the beginning and middle of the film, but as the movie approached the ending, none of this really mattered. Also I didn't really like how Bane died. He was really bad-ass up until the end, where Catwoman whipped him out in 1 second. I was expecting another fight between Batman and Bane, only to find out something else? It was too fast of a death, and not only that, he was the villain of the film, how can you kill a villain in 1 second? And it was not even Batman who killed him, it was Catwoman? I personally wasn't expecting this at all.

-Major Spoilers- The movie really kept you glued to the screen near the end. I really liked the plot twists and never expected some of them. Though some were predictable, but others weren't, IMO. For example, Batman surviving, and Talia escaping from the prison rather than Bane was pretty unpredictable. On the other hand, John Black turning out to be Robin, and Miranda Tate turning out to be Talia al Ghul was more predictable. I think there were some more plot twists, but I can't really remember, because I saw the full movie once, and that was 3 months back.

At first I thought Bane was the one who escaped from the prison, and was the son of Henri Ducard, but it turned out that it was Talia, and Bane was just a friend. This was the real shocker for me. I didn't really care much for the other plot twists, but this really shook me hard. I never expected this, in fact I even forgot about this up until the end. Also batman surviving? This was the second most unpredictable twist. At first I thought just maybe he survived, but after the funeral, I was sure that he was dead. Then he appears in Florence? This was pretty shocking as well.

The second half of the film was the best, because that's when the excitement began. I was very curious about what was going to happen next. After the explosion scenes, the suspense began to rise rapidly. Then the climax came all together very nicely.

My favourite parts of the film in the first half were the opening ""Plane Hijack"" scene, the ""Stock Exchange"" scene, and ""Bane vs Batman"" fight 1. In the second half my favourite scenes were the ""Football explosion"" scene, ""Bane vs Batman"" fight 2, and the final chase scene. Some of the other fight scenes involving Catwoman and Robin were pretty good too.

Final thoughts, I didn't expect much of this movie after TDK. TDK was perfect, and I thought this movie would be no where close, but it was pretty damn close. It was really good too. The action was great. The cast, acting, and dialogue were all fantastic. Especially the dialogue between Alfred and Bruce. Gary Oldman did a great job, not to mention that Joseph Gordon-Levitt did an amazing job as well. Tom Hardy turned out to be a great villain. Even though Bane's voice was kind of confusing, but it was pretty cool. Overall the whole movie includes some great action scenes, and runs a full circle completing TDK legend in an Epic way!

Final Rating 9/10."
"Christopher Nolan has out done himself again, striking not just Batman fans, but fans of the series and movie goers everywhere with his beautifully crafted, last installment of The Dark Knight trilogy, The Dark Knight Rises. The acting has always been well done in the last two, but something about the last one really made me feel the performances were real, quite like the late Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker. The movie ran about two hours and forty-five minutes give or take, but I never wanted it to end. The story progression never seemed to drag on, the movie always kept me on the edge of my seat. This is one that will be an all time favorite of mine, and a true classic.

"I can't express in words of how amazing this movie is. All I have to say is go watch it for yourself.the is really the best,don't get me wrong i enjoyed the others but this one truly takes the cake!I said before batman begins is the best film i had ever seen without any exception. However viewing the 2005 Christopher Nolan production, I was pleasantly shocked. Then after my huge expectations for, ""The Dark Knight"", Christopher Nolan blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, ""The Dark Knight Rises""? Quite simply, Yes! My big expectations were once again, blown away. What a production! This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The editing, sound, score, visuals, direction and action are all top notch.I am wholly satisfied with Christopher Nolan's vision and thank all who worked on this film for bringing such an intricate interpretation of its very famous literary source.a big kiss for Christian Bale and Anne Hathaway i really love them.if i visit USA this will be for visit Christian Bale and Anne Hathaway. thanks for all."
"Christopher Nolan was assigned with the job of coming out with a new Batman movie comparable to The Dark Knight. Did he succeed? In short, yes. Is it better than The Dark Knight? No. But is it incredible, awesome, and everything we could have hoped for? Yes. This movie would be the best Batman movie and even one of the best movies ever if Heath Ledger wouldn't have put on the face paint. That's what I think is the biggest difference between the movies. While Tom Hardy's Bane is very very well done and flat out frightening at times, nobody can top Ledger's Joker. But don't think for a second that TDKR is any worse because of that.

The Dark Knight Rises brings the biggest threat of all three movies to Gotham in the form of Bane. Bane is Batman's biggest threat he's ever had physically and forces Bruce Wayne to return as Batman after entering an isolated state. Much less happens in this movie than in the previous two and I think it's because of the villains. In Batman Begins, Batman had to fight the Mob, Scarecrow, and Ras Al Ghul. In The Dark Knight, Batman had to fight the Mob, The Joker, and Two-Face. In The Dark Knight Rises, Batman has to fight Bane, and only Bane. From beginning to end, all Batman has to do is figure out how to defeat Bane and stop him from finishing his evil plot. While Batman Begins is some what lessened in genius because it has to tell the origin story of Batman, and The Dark Knight is just obviously amazing to everyone who sees it, The Dark Knight Rises has more of a hidden genius. Most people will miss all the symbols and why this movie is so brilliant and such a masterful ending to the Dark Knight's Legacy.

There's so much I wish I can say, but I don't want to spoil it for you. All I should say is see it. See it and be amazed by it. 10 Stars out of 10."
Gotham's reckoning.Well TDKR the last installment of the Nolan's Batman series ended in the perfect note the way trilogies are a supposed to end the real trilogy. So whats so great about this movie? This movie has it own moments when you get the chills on several occasions about whats is going to happen next it is almost breathtaking.Brilliant performances by all the actors in the movie.Hans Zimmer did it again by making the perfect score for the movie which will glue you to the seat and a wonderful plot which brings justice to the entire series. But but there is a but there are a few things which i felt should have been how it was which I am not going to mention because this needs to be a spoiler free review and i want it to be but this movie is worth every penny. Is this movie better than The Dark Knight? Well to that I have to think about it I cant sum up to the conclusion yet but again for me Batman Begins revolves around Batman The Dark Knight about the people of Gotham TDKR well why are you still reading this go watch it for yourself as i said it was worth every dime ...
"As a huge fan of superhero movies and undeniably the batman Christopher Nolan has depicted is the favourite of my choice. He is humane yet enigmatic, heroic and self-giving. Chris Nolan has produced superhero movies into a whole different level. The action, acting, sound and other visual effects was absolutely mind-blowing for the previous two productions. He is good at picking the right cast playing the right role like Michael Caine, Gary Oldham and Morgan Freeman who have always been the linchpin behind the success of the movie. I am also in awe of his previous works excluding the batman series such as Momento and The Prestige. So I had high hope and expectation on the Dark Knight Rises of how the director can build up the finale of the Batman trilogy which the world has long anticipated this blockbuster.

Judged by the content of the trailers, lots of people might expect it to be an action intensive film with lots of explosive elements and the elemental conflict between good and evil. If I'm honest, I have already seen most of the action scenes of the movie via the trailers before watching the film which is a saddening thing to hear from an audience's point of view. The entire film was almost three hours long and there were way too much chit chatting with the whole conspiracy by the villain but not getting down into the main point or the action bits. I think those scenes about having trials on the people by the judge whether they were guilty or not was plainly farcical in my opinion and quite cheesy which I never experienced in the previous two batman films.

The Dark Knight Rises has put in a lot of new characters who played a key role in the film including Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing John Blake and Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate. But the main villain, Bane played by Tom Hardy made me anticipated on how he can use his eyes as his weapon to proceed the acting, to show his wrath towards the corrupted society. I must say I was a bit disappointed at the villain role as the joker simply played too well in The Dark Knight in which Tom Hardy could not exceed the expectation. With those prestigious casts which all of them are great actors, I expected that it would be a sensational experience crafted by those actors. However, the entire film always talking about bits and bobs and never really get to one main theme. The experience was messy and too stuffed in without much focus to cause the audience to fall into the frictional world that Christopher Nolan was trying to present.

In conclusion, The Dark Knight Rises does not exceed my expectation nor better than the predecessor. I thought it was a let down the way how Christopher Nolan wrap up this impeccable Batman series. I only gave the rating 7/10 because of the two fantastic previous productions he made."
"The Dark Knight Rises (2012) The crusader in the mask For the last few years cinematography and special effects took a big step in improving the quality of their own products. That's why every new film set the bar higher and higher, therefor competition is rising. However, this is what exactly people want. Today once again saw this movie and decided to share my point of view, because while it is almost 3 years old, nevertheless with every time watching this film is no less mesmerizing.

In my opinion the plot of the third part surpassed even the second with loved by all great Heath Ledger as the Joker. It is very interesting and confusing, and if the beginning of the film (as is a rule in the case with Cristofer Nolan) is pretty tight, by the end of it is already impossible to put down. Eight years after the events of the previous part Gotham lives in piece and silence. Police Commissioner James Gordon feels guilty about covering up Harvey Dant's crimes and Dark Knight's disappearing because of that. However, events occurring in the city for the last days cry for help the hero, as well as the beauty who has got into trouble – Cat Woman. So Batman dares to speak out against the main villain – Bane. Christopher Nolan - a man who showed how the movie can be removed on comics. Already, it makes him one of the best producers nowadays. As he said, for the first Batman movie the main theme was ""fear"", for the second - ""chaos"", for the last - ""pain"". This pain is more soulful and Bruce Wayne will feel it completely.

Christian Bale – a man always on his top. For the late 80's and 90's kids he will always be the Dark Knight. Christian Bale is my Batman. He is my hero.

Anne Hathaway - a perfect Cat Woman. She is my favorite actress and she didn't disappoint me. It costs a lot. Joseph Gordon-Levitt played the role of energetic young cop - Blake. It seems this guy have a bright future, because Joseph is showing cool actor's skills. Morgan Freeman,

Gary Oldman and Michael Caine showed that ""old"" doesn't mean ""bad"". An incredible full compliance with the allotted roles. Soundtrack. «Basara Deshi» permeates the entire history by becoming the theme both for Bane and Batman.

I can say with certainty that the film was a success. Nice plot and amazing special effects because of the big budget are doing their job. Strong main villain who are all the time winning good guys causes the audience worry and fear. However, like rays are trying to break through the clouds, good is trying to break through. All this and beautiful Anne Hathaway don't give the audience to look away from the screen. Many of the best characters in the Batman universe, as if in a mirror, reflect the character of the protagonist, or when walking on the razor's edge between justice and revenge, or when caught in a trap of injuries in the past. Loyal fans of comics hardly surprised many plot twists, which is quite natural if we remember how the story developed in detail. For truly impressive how Nolan and his co-authors-screenwriter David S. Goyer and Jonathan Nolan managed to finish the trilogy of Batman. The film seems to be more emotional than the second part with it's psychological games. Of course, it has a lot of drama and even tragedy as well, but ""Dark Knight Rises"" touches the most. This large-scale painting, remaining harmonious, with great music and very beautiful camera work. However, the scope and action, going beyond imagination, leads to the fact that the scene, each of which is costs more than the budget of any other film, are perceived as ordinary events, while Bruce Wayne looks better in private moments, whether it's the episode where one of the characters finally realizes who is actually a man- bat, or the scene with the advent of a new character. Also there is a problem with the female audience understanding the reality of the plot, because there a lot of moments related to the previous parts. For example, such an important character of the first part and Batman story as Ras'el'Gul, whose name was named in a few episodes of the movie. Everyone should see this picture, are you a child or adult, it does not matter whether you love comics knight in black armor or you don't. Everyone who will leave the cinema will be inspired by something. Your brain processes speed up and you will feel strong and ready for new challenges. No matter where you are, who you are, when you are. What is important is that the message is delivered to you and it's your business what to do with it. Nolan and Co. did what they wanted to do. Created a symbol. Created a hero. My hero.

Score: 10 out of 10 Batmans"
"A feline fingerer has taken to your pearls, although identity's the intent of this girl, as she initiates engagement, allows the stirring of assuagement, the final chapter is prepared, starts to unfurl. A villain name of Bane brings down an empire, an exchange leads to a tomb, so deep and dire, a saviour's weaponised, the population terrorised, Ra's al Ghul's destructive end, is the desire. But there are those who can align and form resistance, as you recover your resolve and your persistence, as the endgame twists and turns, a web of intrigue is discerned, and you race to save the day and create distance."
"There's a common misconception when it comes to The Dark Knight Rises especially regarding how it tackles it's themes and story: this film isn't trying to raise the stakes, it's trying to add to the story, in this case his loneliness, his sense of powerlessness.

Hans Zimmer's score is some of the best I've ever heard, Wally Pfister peaked, had the best choreographed action scenes out of the whole trilogy, had the most emotionally resonant story out of the trilogy for sure. A very well made and satisfying conclusion that makes this trilogy one of the best .. ever?

A perfect comic book movie, certainly one of my favourites of all time"
"Christopher Nolan's *The Dark Knight Rises* serves as a powerful conclusion to his acclaimed Batman trilogy, delivering a breathtaking blend of action, emotion, and thematic depth that elevates the superhero genre. Set eight years after the events of *The Dark Knight*, Gotham City is in a state of uneasy peace, and Bruce Wayne, portrayed masterfully by Christian Bale, is a shadow of his former self. The film adeptly explores themes of redemption, resilience, and sacrifice, leaving viewers contemplating the complexities of heroism.

Nolan's direction is impeccable, capturing the grandeur and scale of Gotham in its darkest hour. The cinematography is striking, with sweeping shots that enhance the film's epic scope. The supporting cast, including Tom Hardy as the formidable Bane and Anne Hathaway as the enigmatic Selina Kyle, add depth and intrigue to the narrative. Hardy's portrayal of Bane is particularly noteworthy, bringing a physicality and menace that challenges Batman in unexpected ways.

The film's pacing is engaging, interspersing intense action sequences with moments of quiet reflection, allowing the audience to connect with the characters' struggles. The score, once again composed by Hans Zimmer, elevates the experience, underscoring the emotional stakes of the story.

Overall, *The Dark Knight Rises* is a triumphant conclusion that brings closure to Bruce Wayne's journey. It masterfully balances thrilling action with profound character development, solidifying its place as a modern cinematic classic. Fans of the genre and newcomers alike will find themselves captivated by this ambitious and emotionally charged finale."
"The tone of The Dark Knight Rises is set from the very first scene, when we are introduced to Bane (Tom Hardy) who crashes a plane that he himself is a passenger to. This is the first time we see the brute strength that he possesses. He is insanely strong through the use of the chemical ""venom"" which is pumped into him through his mask. As we leap into the rest of the story we see right away that director, Christopher Nolan, wasted no time in picking up right where he left off in The Dark Knight, with the death of Harvey Dent, and Batman being the criminal. This film was one of the big blockbusters in summer 2012, and for good reason. This movie brings the classic Batman comic book characters to life, which is evident in the acting, the sets, the script, the plot, and as many know, the dramatic ending. The acting is so well done, as we see emotion poured into each roll. Christian Bale (Bruce Wayne) Michael Cane (Alfred Pennyworth), Tom Hardy (Bane), and Anne Hathaway (Selena Kyle) all dove head first into their roles, leaving nothing behind. They each play a convincing role, identical to the characters that are portrayed in the Batman comics. One of the best examples is the relationship between Batman and Catwoman, because Batman is just, and Catwoman is a thief, but they are romantically involved with each other. The sets of this movie are stunning. Bruce Wayne's mansion and Batcave are just as they are depicted in the original comics. They are all encompassing and eye candy to any Batman lover. As we look back to the 1990's, we see a Batman comic book story arc that is very similar to the plot of TDKR. But Nolan's twist on the storyline is a refreshing change. Some may disagree, but not knowing what is coming next is part of the joy that comes with this film. Nolan keeps some of the key reference points in his film, but adds his own interesting, and modern additions to the film. Take for example, Bane's appearance. In the comics, Bane was unrealistically strong, and in the film he is much more realistically depicted. The only complaint I have with this film is, if Bane is so strong, why does he cover up his muscles with a vest or a coat for the majority of the movie? Show off your strength, be proud! The plot is the main focus point, like it should be. If explosions and fighting is all you want to see, then go see Pacific Rim. I'll say sorry in advance if you have wasted your time with that movie. Getting back on track to the plot, which might take a couple of watch throughs to fully catch all of the detail in this storyline. Throughout this movie, the focus is not on Batman, as one would expect, but on Gotham City itself. Bane brings the city to hell and back, and Batman is sitting on the side lines, bruised and battered, left watching, waiting, and hoping that his beloved city isn't left shattered and destroyed. The script of TDKR was written with pure precision, which allows us, as an audience, to remember key points of the movie through the use of dramatic quotes. Bane has a lot of one-liners that leave you repeating them to your friends after you see the film. Here are a few examples of memorable Bane quotes; ""But you merely adopted the dark; I was born in it, molded by it."" ""when it is done and Gotham is ashes, then you have my permission to die."" Because of Bane's voice, these short, memorable lines only add to the effect Nolan was going for. Leaving you on the edge of your seat wondering how Batman could possibly win? The moment you doubt if the good guy can win, that's when you know the director has succeeded.

This was a very well done film, and I encourage you to see it several times (it might take a few times to fully grasp the story) and the way this film ends is the perfect way to close out the series. In the end it all comes down to autopilot, back stabbing, and a turn of events by a woman you would not expect, all ending in an unpredictable manner."
The Dark Knight Rises is one of the most intense super hero movies I have watched. The opening scene is intense as the bad guys swing into action to get the good guys as the plane is moving into a tail spin. This time the world is void of the Bat crusader as he is in mourning the loss of his beloved. The plot lines are mix as you feel at times you need a chart to know who the good and bad guy is. The thread though out the movie is dark and deep and the most dramatic character is the bad guy Bane appears to take over the city of Gotham. A long movie that will keep you in total suspense until the end of the run. This movies does a good job of bringing into the mix several story lines from the comic book series. bravo!
"as much as i am huge fan of the batman in almost every facet of the genre, i am having a hard time getting completely behind this film. it makes the same mistake a lot of sequels do: it tries to pack too much into the story. the reason why the first two films in the trilogy, batman begins and the dark knight, worked so well was because they mostly focused on one central story and villain. in the dark knight rises there are too many new characters and too many story lines to be introduced and told that the film loses focus. sure it has plenty of action which you would expect but nolan strays too far from the source material when it comes to the characters in the film. the cast does a fine job with the script they had to work with and most film goers will probably like this film but i think true fans of the batman who know the history of the characters will wonder what nolan is doing to their batman."
"What is up with all this haters? Seriously, it makes me want to laugh because they're so ignorant. Some people here are saying: ""Worst Batman film ever"", or: ""I prefer watching Adam West Batman than this mess."" Wow, just wow. Anyways, enough complaining, this is one of the greatest conclusions in film trilogies history. No worry, this is a spoiler free review. The film is almost 3 hours long and the impressive thing is, the movie is NEVER dull, it's always keeping you interested because if its smart dialog and action. The story is great too. Bruce Wayne has stopped fighting crime as the Batman for 8 years after the Joker wanted to terrorize Gotham. But now a new threat has arrived, Bane. His plan is to burn Gotham to ashes and the Batman is the only one who can stop him.

Now the cast in this movie is really good. Christian Bale is a great Batman as always. Michael Caine deserves an Oscar nomination as best Supporting character for his amazing performance as Alfred Pennyworth. Anne Hathaway really impressed me as Catwoman. She steals any scene she's in. Tom Hardy as Bane is a great villain in this film. My favorite villain since the Joker. Joseph Gordon Levitt as John Blake delivers a good performance as well. Also Morgan Freeman and Marion Cottillard were good as well.

I love Trilogies, this trilogy is in my top 5 and ranks #2 right behind The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. In conclusion this is an amazing trilogy, the best of superheroes films and the second best trilogy of all time. All I have to say is, thank you Mr. Nolan, thank you. 10/10."
"This film is spectacular, the closest thing I have seen to perfection in film since the good ol days of filmmaking.

If you're hoping its better than The Dark Knight, your hopes have been answered. Christopher Nolan somehow outdoes himself once again, delivering a fantastic plot with great action, character development, and direction.

The writing itself is a wonder. The dialogue in this film is outstanding and perfectly fits each character.

Heath Ledger set a new standard for acting talent in comic book films. TDKR definitely meets that bar, possibly surpassing it. No single performance is better than Ledger's but everyone gives 110% in this and it comes together nicely. Christian Bale gives perhaps his most heartfelt performance in this one, and Tom Hardy is terrifying as Bane. Other regulars such as Caine and Oldman are just as good as ever. Joseph Gordon Levitt is a breath of fresh air and plays his part to perfection. However, I give it to Anne Hathaway for stealing the show. She is seductive, sexy, and dangerous as Catwoman, and becomes the very essence of the femme fatale.

Hans Zimmer continues to be my favorite film composer. His score simply blows me away, especially the way he uses the chants from the trailers as Bane's theme. Zimmer promised us an epic score, and delivered.

Editor Lee Smith and Director of Photography Wally Pfister both continue their win streak, as well as production designer Nathan Crowley and Costume designer Lindy Hemming.

All in all, TDKR is the best of this series. It is emotionally gripping and, at times, gutwrenching. As a current film student, I can honestly say that TDKR possesses all of the essential qualities of an Oscar for Best Picture. If you have seen the previous two Batman movies, you will enjoy this film so much more than you ever have. It truly is a whole new cinematic experience."
"So after seeing the The Dark Knight my expectations were pretty high for this movie and most movies would fail miserably but luckily The Dark Knight Rises is not one of most movies. It absolutely lived up to my expectations. What was good about the movie? Pretty much everything. The acting was top notch in this movie everyone does a good job in it. The action was great but the movie is great without action. Tom Hardy as Bane is one of the most terrifying villains I have ever seen. I likes the characters, the story everything. The one gripe that people might have is that it is very dark. But even that is not a real issue. In the end I loved this movie I recommend it to everyone an even though its not as good as The Dark Knight its still an amazing movie."
"Right from the start of the movie you will be on the edge of your seat. Personally I think this is the best conclusion I have ever seen. Performance of each actor in the movie is outstanding.Before I saw the movie I thought that Anne Hathaway wouldn't be as good cat-woman as Michelle Pfeiffer was, but not only was she better, she blew Michelle away. All the special effects are amazing and unbelievable. I have to say I love some of the batman's new toys. I have seen it in V Max theater last night but I am going to see it again in I MAX because Its worth the experience. It runs for 2 hours and 45 minutes but it felt like 30 minutes and I wanted more. 10 stars is not enough for such a great movie. I recommend to all movie lovers out there to go and see it in cinemas."
"what can i say really, this movie is fantastic. the plot is genius. the actors and so well put together. the best movie of 2012!

The direction they took this movie is beautiful. and the way ended the trilogy is breathtaking.

This is the best batman movie. his biggest job yet!

Save gotham one last time! the rise sequence is perfect. Lovie it!

10/10 all the way.

nolan the way.....

Nolan is amazing! :)

Also, Bane is great. Now i like joker and bane both. i like them eqaul. The joker scared me but yet i rooted for him. Bane really freaked me out! Scary stuff!"
"The Dark Knight Rises and Falls. I cannot put it in more simpler words than that.

I went in there with my coffers full of hope of having my mind blown out. After all it was Christopher Nolan and I am yet to see a work of his which has under-delivered.

But I guess everything has a first time.

Don't get me wrong. It's a good movie, not just a great one, and it left me highly confused as to how I should feel about it. TDKR, more than anything, falls under its own weight. With the endless hype and as a follow up to one of the greatest superhero movies of all time, TDKR had a lot riding on its shoulders. Tasked with this,Christopher Nolan has to be lauded for what he has achieved, or should I rather say 'hoped to'?

Let's begin with the basics. The Dark Knight trilogy was not a trilogy to begin with. Batman Begins (BB) and The Dark Knight (TDK) are almost two independent Batman films with little in common in terms of a story arc other than the characters it carries forward. That given, TDKR's greatest flaw was in attempting to connect the first movie to his final one so as to make it feel like one continuous arc. (Think kind of what happened in the final season of LOST) While I understand Nolan's intentions, the forced continuity just killed it.

This was further amplified by the many plot holes that marred the story. To keep this review spoiler free I will not mention any of them here but it will suffice to say that if you are a fan of the series but are willing to look past your fanboy goggles, the failings are plain to see.

Tom Hardy's take on the superstrong Bane was interesting enough to start off with, but as it went on there were just too many similarities with a previous villain (I will not say which one) to actually stand out on his own. Even his motives and methods were too familiar to be regarded as novel. His fights with Batman were epic enough though, and you almost pity Batman for having to face the mini-hulk that Hardy had transformed himself into. His menacing voice coupled with the cold hard stare in his eyes gave him the aura of a truly awful foe, one that must not be triffled with.

But add to that some cringe worthy dialogues, forgetful action sequences and appalling acting by Marion Cotillard, and I find myself subtracting more from the movie than adding. Nolan needed to make this movie bigger and better than the previous two, and for that he needed a crisis large enough to destroy Batman's world. While he did manage to conjur up a scheme, its immensity and implausibility made it hard to believe. I really wanted to love this movie but far too often found myself shaking my head in dismay as things got grander and larger, until they no more fit into the world.

But while I might seem to be cursing the movie a lot, remember I did say it is a good movie. And the best thing for me in the movie was - wait for it - Anne Hathaway as Catwoman/Selina Kyle.

I will confess that when I had first heard the casting I was more than dismayed. But now I'm forced to eat my own words. Anne Hathaway was brilliant. She might not be your regular comic book version of Selina Kyle, but in Nolan's Dark Knight universe she was the perfect choice to portray Gotham's sexiest vigilante. Everything from her stance to her fight moves and to the way she spouted sassy dialogues was perfect. Given more time and space, I am sure she could have probably stolen the show.

That however would have been unfair to Christian Bale/Bruce Wayne/Batman. The man has been a constant shining light throughout the series. He is a perfect fit for the role and has carried both versions of his character almost flawlessly. Moving into his third (and final) film in the series, I am glad to say he has not faltered a bit. While BB was about Batman, and TDK about the Joker, this movie was about Bruce Wayne the man behind the mask. As a superhero who is a mere mortal compared to most others out there, TDKR's focus on Bruce Wayne's mortality was totally warranted. This was not a Batman movie. This was a Bruce Wayne movie, with his alter ego guest starring. TDKR plays out like the swansong it is to this great character Bale and Nolan have moulded over the years.

Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine are as dependable as usual. They provided stellar performances as always. Even the newcomer to series - Joseph Gordon-Levitt gave a fine performance as the hotheaded cop John Blake. His character was by far one of the most interesting in the movie, developing into interesting dimensions, but alas finally being let down partly by the story and mostly by the limited run time that a movie of this scope can afford to a new character.

All in all, TDKR is a fine movie, but sadly nothing more. While I thoroughly enjoyed the ending (the last 5-10 minutes) and a bunch of scenes here and there, the action sequenced seemed bland, and the motives for some of the main characters left a lot to be desired. Batman was great as usual, but Bruce Wayne was better. And given the track-record of threequels, TDKR is a comparatively great ending to a great series, even if it is not all that it could have been. Probably the weakest entry to the series but nonetheless a wholesome entertainer on its own merits. Just don't expect to be blown away."
"I am not a critic but an average movie goer , but I must say that this movie is a pale shadow of the previous movie .

Missing the usual quality of a Chris Nolan movie . The movie lacks the frenetic pace of the previous title .First half of the movie is painfully slow . Second half picks up pace but still no big fireworks. Anne Hathaway unexpectedly performed very well in her role .

Weak story line .Background score average .Villain is simply lame with a dog mask ,and is nowhere near the calibre of Joker.No great twists or surprise in the plot ,lacks suspense .

Overall a better than average movie .Take my advice watch it at home ."
"The Dark Knight Rises is a brilliant,excellent and masterful epic conclusion to The Dark Knight Trilogy. Filled with excellent direction,wonderful performances,great Action and epic storytelling,The Dark Knight Rises is Christopher Nolan at his best.

Set eight years after the events in The Dark Knight,Batman/Bruce Wayne(Christian Bale) has been a recluse and retired as Batman and Gotham City has been at peace as well as safe and quiet. But when a new threat and terrorist named Bane(Tom Hardy)comes into Gotham City and threatens to destroy and demolish Gotham,Batman must come out of retirement to fight and face Bane and save the city of Gotham from destruction.

The Dark Knight Rises is a powerful and unforgettable conclusion to The Dark Knight Trilogy,it is a film that loved since I saw it in theaters and I cannot understand why the film has gotten a mixed to negative reception with most Batman fans. I guess because this film came out after Nolan's other films The Dark Knight and Inception which raised the bar really high when it comes to filmmaking and were universally loved by everyone and comparing this film with the other two this film can be seen as letdown for most people but not to me. The Dark Knight Rises is an Epic in the truest since of the word because Nolan has created a film that is big not only in length(2 Hours and 45 minutes)but in scope as well bringing everything to higher level whether it's the Action or the storyline. The film was so epic it probably would be longer with an overture like the epics of the 50s and 60s. Most of the time the third film in the trilogy is usually seen as the weakest but Nolan is a smart filmmaker who knows that if you are going to complete a trilogy you have to go out with a huge bang and TDKR goes out with not only a bang but with explosions. What I love about TDK Trilogy is that while all of them are three connected films all them are different in story. If Batman Begins is an origin story and Action/Adventure and The Dark Knight is a Crime Drama then TDKR can be described as a War Film. TDKR is War Film in sense where there are armies rising and gangs are controlling the streets with power,guns and tanks and Gotham is divided like a Civil War between the rich and poor or cops and criminals. With the theme of War and control running throughout the film you pulled into a Dystopian nightmare where Gotham City is being held hostage and not the cops or government can do anything about it and the only person that can do anything about is Batman. In TDKR we see not only the physical but also the mental toll being Batman has had on Bruce Wayne. Bruce has become broken down and a recluse and the damage of being Batman has affected his friendships and relationships or lack there of. Bane is such a great villain because where The Joker in TDK wanted to make people evil and corrupt and wanted to burn Gotham,Bane wants the people of Gotham to take control and take back the city of Gotham from the corrupt and the rich and create a revolution and army and still wants to destroy Gotham City. Bane is villain unlike Batman has ever faced before because Bane can match Batman on no only a physical level but on an intelligence level as well. The Action scenes in the film are amazing and like the first two films are done in a realistic way. Each Action scene is handled with a great deal of suspense and build up and this time it is done on an big scale to match the epic feel of the film. When the Action in the film happens you are glued to the screen and mesmerized. The ending of the film lasts about 20-30 minutes and it will blow you away with it's filmmaking and craft. The ending will have you cheering and smiling and it is a great conclusion to this film and The Dark Knight Trilogy.

The cast does an excellent jobs in their roles. Christian Bale is excellent in his final performance as Batman/Bruce Wayne bringing the same depth and intensity to the role. Tom Hardy is simply brilliant and scary as Bane,with using his voice,eyes and body language for the performance. Hardy's performance in my opinion makes Bane one of the best villains in film history. Gary Oldman is great once again as Jim Gordan,with Oldman bringing cynicism and depth to the role. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is fantastic as Blake,an idealistic rookie cop. Anne Hathaway is wonderful and sexy as Catwoman/Selina Kyle and has great scenes with Bale. Marion Cotillard does a great job as Miranda,Bruce's other love interest. Morgan Freeman excels once again as Lucius Fox,Batman's weapon maker. Michael Caine is amazing once again as Alfred. Caine's final scenes with Bale are powerful and well-acted. Matthew Modine(Foley)and Ben Mendelsohn(Daggett)give good performances as well.

The direction by Christopher Nolan is excellent and brilliant,with Nolan always moving the camera and having great shots and camera angles and giving the film an epic feel and Nolan does a great job with the Action scenes. Great direction by Nolan.

The score by Hans Zimmer is brilliant and intense and matches the dark and epic tone of the film. A great memorable score by Zimmer.

In final word,if you love Batman,Christopher Nolan,Comic Book films,Superhero films or films in general,I highly suggest you see The Dark Knight Rises,a brilliant,masterful and epic conclusion to an excellent trilogy that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10."
"well may lot of you not going to like my review cause am really really a great big fan of batman.after batman begins,and fabulous the dark knight,am just waiting when the 3rd installment of nolan series going to released.well a lot of time has passed but i am writing this review because i just thought i should have right something for it cause i love this movie.its almost 2 years now and trust me friends,,every night i watch one of the batman movie.specially dark knight rises,i have watched it more than 200 times.so i think you can imagine i am quite disbalanced from my head site.whatever people say it don't really matter.the only thing is matter how much did u enjoyed when you seen a movie.christopher nolans batman series is one of the best movies i have seen in my life.many many thanks to you sir.Christian bale,,you are just amazing.the joker, ben each and every character are truly remarkable.i just love the full batman team.the dark knight is the best in the series.but the dark knight rises may don't have the strong content like the previous installment but its really a huge entertainment for me.hope batman will come again to save the gotham..."
"Title: The title is perfect for movie story specially for main character. Actually it's better than 'batman' to me.

Genre: Action: In my point of view, action seemed to be a wrestling show.

Crime: Yes, this is an actual crime movie.

Thrill: It's truly thrilling at each and every sequence of movie.

Drama: The total dramatic plot is tremendously evolved with strong characters

Visual Effects: The batman's ride thing, bike, burning property etc are extremely accurate.

Character: Obviously Christian Bale and Tom Hardy.

Overall, I like it. It is really enjoyable and entertaining. Of course you'd want to see it again and again."
"I don't know where to start,. The power source shown in movie caught my eye;its very nice of Nolan to show the very future power source without loss of reality.

The action scenes between Wayne and Bane are so dramatic that when Batman hits Bane it clearly portrays that it was more out of confidence and will to fight against evil rather than strength and muscle whereas it appears opposite in case of Bane hitting Batman.The Catwoman's action scenes couldn't have been better the attitude,spontaneous performance,flexibility in physique are perfectly played by Anne Hathaway.

Hans Zimmer's music is an extra ordinary asset to the film .the back scroll in every action sequence is so wonderful to bring up goose bumps all-over.Especially the chant 'deh-shay bas-ha bas-ha' is clouded with drum beat and would take you into the depths of morality in the movie.

After a movie like 'The Dark Knight' its the very guts of Nolan to continue that should be appreciated.he must be a very good social visionary to write-up such an excellent ending to the trilogy.I don't need to separately chant praises on his direction and screenplay.And the twists in movie surprises everyone."
"With a gargantuan ambition, huge stakes, powerful themes, compelling characters and a fantastic third act, The Dark Knight Rises exceeded my already sky high expectations, and delivered an extremely satisfying conclusion to the trilogy."
"Words cannot adequately describe how awesome this movie is! It is everything you thought it would be and much more. Most certainly a beautifully crafted psychological crime thriller and a truly satisfying conclusion that does justice to the trilogy. Batman isn't exactly the cool hero with fancy gadgets nor is he the strongest. His inner strength is tested, he is physically and mentally pushed to his limits and all odds are against him. What an epic finale!

Christian Bale as always is perfect as Bruce Wayne and Batman but Tom Hardy's portrayal of Bane almost steals the show. Unlike Batman's mask where you get to see the emotions through eyes and mouth of the actor, Bane's mask covers his entire mouth, leaving only his eyes in view. Despite an obscured face, actor Tom Hardy seems to have found a way to brilliantly express his emotions physically! He projects Bane's character, the strength, pain, attitude and the darkness by movements and body language alone! Bane is as intellectual as he is strong, which makes him genuinely terrifying. He is easily the most formidable of all Batman villains in the trilogy and simply owned the scenes he was in.

Hans Zimmer does an excellent job with the background score that sets the pace of the movie and compliments the visual artistry. The music makes you feel the excitement and energy of the movie. Both Anne Hathaway and Joseph Gordon-Levitt do justice to their characters. Hathaway is believable as Catwoman. Last but not the least, Michael Caine gives a very effective and heartfelt performance as Alfred.

The special effects in this movie are so good, that it seems very real. The Batpod, which made its appearance in Dark Knight is back in this movie and it is exceedingly cool. But wait till you see 'The Bat'!

This movie has a stellar start, will keep you on the edge of your seat with adrenaline-pumping action sequences, intense drama both emotional and dark, has several layers of the story interweaving with frequent curve balls thrown in. But the movie never loses momentum, it ultimately sets you up for a fantastic climax and probably a very unpredictable yet satisfying end. It will keep you guessing till the very last second and that is the magic of Christopher Nolan's amazing masterpiece, The Dark Knight Rises.

I will give this movie 10 out of 10."
"Every time a good superhero movie is made ,fanatic fanboys have to rush to IMDb to declare it as the ""Greatest Movie Ever Made"" LOL,, I do give them credit for a least being consistent. With that said, it was a good movie but should not even be in any top 100. Yes, the storyline was far fetched for real life but hey, it's the norm for a sci-fi thriller action movie. Villain wants to destroy stuff,, hero must stop him. It was well acted, and the action, while not ground breaking was shot very well. While Anne Hathaway is great to look at, and done an okay job , I felt you could of totally removed her character from the entire film and it would not have made any difference . It was almost like her role was just filler material. In the end to me it's just a fun summer movie to get lost in,,but not to put on a pedestal..."
"The Dark Knight rises is easily the most anticipated film of the year and has a lot to live up to with the previous two entries just seeming to get better and better. With the same creative team intact, can Nolan and Bale pull off the ultimate finale to their trilogy and deliver the film we've all been waiting for or will it fall to the dreaded bad third film syndrome that seems to plague most series?

The Dark Knight Rises continues the journey of Batman eight years after he took the fall for the death and crimes of Harvey Dent. Forced back into action to take on the terrorist Bane, the Dark Knight returns to protect the city that looks at him as an enemy. The Dark Knight was a brilliant film on numerous levels so going in this film already had a big hurdle to overcome. While it may not have completely overshadowed the previous entry, it easily finds its place on equal ground. This final entry to the Nolan series continues to bring these three films together becoming essentially one long film. Rises brings new realm of personal journey to numerous characters old and new. Christian Bale steps back into the role like he never left bringing a new pain that seems to elevate both Wayne and Batman to another level. Most fans will be happy to know that while the growl like voice is still here, it is toned down a bit so not to be quite as off putting. Michael Caine is given a bit more to do taking the character study between Alfred and Wayne that has been building and he delivers more of his motivational and emotional speeches like only he can. Gary Oldman gets a bit more to do as well getting to channel the Gordon we have been waiting for since the beginning. Tom Hardy steps into the role of Bane, a character that is met with mixed emotions. Known in the comics as the villain that broke the bat, has had many incarnations, most of them not all that good and not widely known to those that aren't comic fans. Believe it or not, Nolan has taken a fairly single dimension character and brought to life a destructive force that smashes through this film with no remorse. The big surprise was Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle aka Catwoman. She seemed to be channeling some of the previous versions, most notably that of the 60's series minus the camp. She really makes this character work bringing the sexiness as well as a more empowered woman aspect to the character. She is easily the best incarnation of this character so far.

The story is well crafted bringing all the characters together along with the story to create an epic piece of filmmaking. There are numerous levels to the story that worked well for every character giving each of them their own small story without ever making the film feel overcrowded or forced. It takes a bit to get going, but not in a bad way. There are some pretty heavy moments that push this film along, but will keep you away from the action for longer than you may want. Much like the source material this trilogy is a character study of the inner struggles of a man and not so much about the action. Make no mistake there are plenty of action sequences, each bigger than the next. Nolan has slowed the action down a bit, namely during the fight scenes letting the viewer finally get a better glimpse of the Dark Knight in action. Kudos to Nolan as gone are most of the fancy well-choreographed fights and in their place is a brutality that is needed to make the Bane story work.

This is not only a great film, but a brilliant cap to an already brilliant series. It's a truly amazing experience to see this film come to life and wrap up a series that has continued to get better and better. There are plenty of moments that will make both comic and non-comic fans alike smile and cheer. Nolan has stamped his mark on the Batman universe and has done something almost never thought possible. He has delivered a brilliant Batman trilogy and managed to keep the entire brilliant cast in tact all the way down to members of the Wayne Corp board members. This is a film that will make you cheer and sad that it is coming to an end. As this series comes to an end and the credits role you will find yourself sighing in relief and happiness knowing Nolan pulled it off and wondering what's next for the Batman."
"Ultimately, this is an excellent film, but after seeing this as part of an all night trilogy viewing, I have to say it is not as good as The Dark Knight.

The film opens with, strangely for Nolan a quite farcical scene that introduces Bane. I won't spoil it, but please tell me, who takes 3 unknown prisoners on a plane without even looking at their faces? Really??

The proper story starts, and to chose words like jaded, withdrawn, cynical, tired, lethargic and disconnected, is how we find our hero and Police commissioner. So ultimately this is how the audience is manipulated into feeling too, and so act 1 is ultimately a long ""downer"" as lots of elements are put in place for the last 2 acts. But, after sitting through six hours of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, I was left feeling it was too much, and I started getting bored with the overall emotional shade of the film, coupled with the lack of action and the lack of any real story. It was like watching a plate spinner getting 40 plates spinning on pointy poles, necessary for his act, but ultimately boring for his audience.

The second Act is where our bad guy makes his play and gains the upper hand. One of the strongest sources of praise for The Dark Knight, is the ultimately real-world story telling. But what Bane unleashes on Gotham, takes us back to the more comic book villainy of the first film, which I won't criticise, but for me is not as rewarding as the realism of the second film. All the while our good guys are slow, wrong footed, and creaking under their mental baggage, so we are two thirds through a superhero film, where our superhero has been anything but. Action has been thin on the ground, and we have all been through the ringer, and we are crying for some redeeming pay-off.

After the third act, our her is restored, all has been put right. However, ultimately our pay-off for all we have been put through in the first two acts is only satisfying if you can shrug off the memory of what you have just been put through. It's much like childbirth, you need your brain to be swimming with endorphins to blank out the pain of labour, and for me, I didn't get enough endorphins to make the experience totally rewarding.

Add to this, a slightly facial bad-guy twist, and a groan-worthy sequel shoe-in, I have to say that Nolan has tried to squeeze in far too much, and Batman's saga creeps over the line, rather than ending with a bang, so much so, you will feel convinced that this is not the final part of the story, and we will need another installment to accept that our hero has sailed off into the sunset."
"Apologies, Dominus, I have done many reviews here but to get this one right took me 5 years and multiple re-watchings.

Conclusion? Not merely great, but the ""great-est"" superhero film of all time. The story is iconic and majestic in scope. The script not merely good, it borders on perfection. The performances are nothing less than stunning.

Bale and Oldman could not give a bad performance even if you asked them. Hathaway has never looked this good, her height and frame infusing her Catwoman with a vibe never seen before or since. And the almost-invisible Tom Hardy (one of the greatest actors of our age, BTW) makes Bane as interesting a character, if not moreso, than even Darth Vader himself.

So why did this review take me 5 years? To discover the dissonance between the three parts of the trilogy, which is the only flaw, the Achilles Heel of the boxed set.

Ordinarily a trilogy should be harmonious and consistent. Look at the original Lord of the Rings as the best example. Each part not only stands on its own but, taken in sequence, the story builds, the characters become clearer, everything works to a conclusion.

Like an orchestra reaching a crescendo.

Not so here. The whole is weakened by the sum of the parts. Batman Begins is, frankly, sloppy. Great ideas and even great performances are lost in a weak narrative with a unsatisfying conclusion.

The Dark Knight has become iconic in its own right but not because of the way it continues the story, but rather because of the amazing one-of-a-kind performance by Ledger.

It is only when we get to Part 3 that we achieve perfection. This film is not merely better than than the first two, it may be the best film of its genre, ever."
"It's been eight years since the events of the immediate predecessor to this(a film that this matches in most ways, tops in several, and the only thing it lacks that that has, is Heath Ledger's Joker, and, well, that's part force majeure), and we see the outcome of that. Legislation has made organized crime a thing of the past in the city, and with no need for the caped crusader, Bruce(once again impeccably acted by Bale... and yes, the voice has thankfully been toned down) has a gap in his life that he doesn't know how to fill(straining the relationship between him and Alfred, played by the usually charming and compelling Caine). When a mysterious masked man, known as Bane, a dominating physical presence with a brain(played largely by Hardy's eyes and brows... taking a ton of his tools as an actor away, and still he does incredible), with unclear motives makes his presence known, he realizes he will have to become Batman again. But is he enough to take out this new threat? This finishes the series, providing closure to the characters and story. Catwoman is done right here, and just about perfect. She's finally a femme fatale... hot and manipulative. They do with her what we hoped they'd do with Black Widow. And this does justice to the relationship between her and Wayne. The performances are great all around. Most return from the other two(and Freeman gets a lot more to do), with a few new faces, such as Gordon-Levitt as idealistic cop John. This does a lot to surprise us, and like TDk, it does it right, with hardly any of them being unnecessary, and none of them insulting. The bleakness is back and amplified - this puts its titular hero and its audience through a serious amount of pain and conflict, with a genuine feeling that it might not work out. And as a result of this, and other brave decisions made(you can barely believe these are mainstream movies!), it becomes really powerful, really draws us in. The action is the biggest and best of these(the jet he uses is awesome! And the Pod gets some more really cool use, in the edge-of-your-seat chases, and we get fast martial arts(and covered well!), and the stakes and tension are the highest(and frankly, if they were raised any higher, it would be excessive... this is already as draining as the last one). There is a lot of disturbing content, some violence and a little moderate to strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone interested in these(and make sure you've watched the other two first, this really adds to them). 10/10"
"Got to watch it in a preview show here in India. Was stunned with the way Nolan has narrated the story. It is simply AWESOME! Everything looks so perfect here, right from the starting, till the end credits roll. Even though i am not an ardent fan of action/superhero movies, I liked the first two installments of the series, so the expectation for this was so huge. And to be frank, i am happy with the outcome. Ii is brilliant in every aspect. Nolan's direction is top-notch and he is the real hero of the movie. I even felt goosebumps in certain sequences. I do not want to reveal the story much, but what i can say is, this one is a must for every movie lover. Such an awesome performance from Tom Hardy! I was just amazed to see him perform Bane. Christian Bale is no less, he is literally perfect reprising his role from the previous two films. The other actors have done good job. But i missed Heath Ledger, may his soul rest in peace. Anyway, what i have to say is, do not miss this film, lest it is a real loss for you. I would like to rate it 8.5/10, And Hats off to Nolan and the entire crew for giving us such a cinematic experience."
"Another achievement by Nolan Bros. and Warner Bros... Thanks to its huge budget available (ca 230 million USD) one could use state-of-the-art technology and employ a dream-team of actors of different generations: Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Anne Hathaway, Joseph Gordon-Levitt... And they got the opportunity to have elaborated roles to play, not just appearing in the background; Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth is probably the finest of the great ones. Moreover, it is no comic strip movie, but an epic story of universal values, attitudes and issues, with superhero and sci-fi moments complementing the script, not governing it.

Minuses from me due to length (ca 2,5 hours) and too obvious references/comparisons with characters from other hit movies (e.g. Hannibal, Catwoman, James Bond). But still, the movie is worth watching and recommendable!"
"This movie is full of excitement, explosions, and edge of your seat moments. It ties up all of the loose ends in a great culmination to the series. The casting is perfect. I was surprised by some of the characters that were added. I would have liked to see the story line continued though. It is a bit of a let down that they didn't incorporate more of the villains.Or even continue the series to include cooperative adventures for multiple DC heroes.It is great that they managed to keep all of the same actors from the previous movies. It irritated me when they changed the actress who played Rachel. I think that this is a good date movie or movie for a family with older children. Of course it is great for a guys night. Make sure you have you popcorn ready."
"As the ending chapter in the trilogy I enjoyed this movie the most. It had more of Bruce Wayne than just Batman. It showed Bruce's face behind the Batman mask and did so believably. Like we all know the Joker took the spotlight in the previous film and the first one was more Batman action. So we got a trilogy with a balanced focus between the guise, the seamlessly corrupt and the person behind the guise. Which is nice.

As a movie about the struggling person behind the mask this was, for me, the most touching out of the three films. And the most hope inducing, seeing Bruce Wayne recollect himself from the pit and rise to stand on his own feet. Re-mustering his courage and will."
"The Dark Knight Rises (2012)

*** 1/2 (out of 4)

The final film in Christopher Nolan's trilogy finds Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) coming out of retirement and putting on the Batman suit as he tries to save Gotham City from a nuclear weapon being controlled by Bane (Tom Hardy). THE DARK KNIGHT RISES isn't quite as good as the previous film but I'd put it a little ahead of the first movie in the series but no matter how you rank them you really have to give Nolan, Bale and company credit for really delivering a very special series that I'm sure went a lot higher than most people thought when news broke that this group would be taking over the franchise. While this film is far from perfect there are still so many great things that it's easy to get lost in the film and caught up in the various situations going on. I think the strongest thing going for the picture is the wonderful visual style and as with the previous two films, the way Nolan builds this dark atmosphere and city is just something so many other directors should be studying going forward. Another major asset is that Bale can bring that dark and mysterious nature to the Wayne character while at the same time being very believable in the part of Batman. I think it's fair to say that he's put his stamp on the character and if this is his last go at it then he's done more than any previous actor. The supporting cast includes strong work from Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Mario Cotillard and Gary Oldman. Hardy was extremely good in the villain role of Bane and really helped make the film so much fun. Anne Hathaway gives a decent performance as Catwoman but I must admit that I thought the screenplay really didn't do much for the character and in the end she had little impact with me. The 164-minute running time does seem a bit too drawn out at spots but I was still rather amazed at how well it flowed and this credit certainly goes to Nolan. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES closes this trilogy and really ends it with a bang and it's clear that the series going forward will have a lot to live up to."
The writing is horrible and the pace is agonizingly draining.
"To be honest....there's not much to say about this movie. I am an avid film critic and I am completely lost for words.

Christopher Nolan is the best director/writer/producer/creator right now and now arguably of all time. Christian Bale = consistently phenomenal. Tom Hardy = unbelievable. Hewitt = great young actor. Hathaway = incredible. Freeman = Freeman, enough said.

The Dark Knight Rises has not only set the bar for superhero/action movies, but movies of all genres. 15/10..yup. Unbelievable.

There really isn't much to say about this movie because honestly there is nothing to compare it too. NO movie comes close...try to argue it and I will leave you in the dust. Enough said...I'm done. WOW"
"Before I get down-voted because I'm not giving 'The Dark Knight Rises' a 10 (the trend most of the users on her seem to be following), I'll list the numbers of things I really enjoyed about the film, and there were plenty.

-The cast Nolan's able to put together to end his trilogy is really something to marvel at. From the veterans of the series (Bale, Freeman, Caine, Oldman) to the new faces (Gordon-Levitt, Cotillard, Hathway, Hardy) each bring their all to their characters, even if a few are somewhat undeveloped (more on that later).

-Action scenes. 'Batman Begins,' while I admire it for it's first look at the gritty take to the comic formula, had some incredible poor and incomprehensible fight scenes, where it was unclear how who punching what or what was happening. In 'The Dark Knight,' the scenes were much more clear, a big improvement. Here, the fighting scenes are at their best. When Baine and Batman throw down, it's some of the most intense fight scenes I've seen in a long time.

-Huge setpieces. I could say that about all of these movies, but in this film especially. Gotham City is beautifully recognized. It's always great to see a huge place like this down naturally, never been plagued by artificial CGI (Nolan uses as little as possible.) Not to mention the number of extras, which number in the thousands.

-The ending. Even if it jumps the shark, the ending to Nolan's epic trilogy is overall fulfilling. Fans of the series won't be disappointed, even if the casual might

Not that that's out of the way, the problems I had with the film. . .

-Bane's voice. When we first meet Bane, on a plane, his voice was nearly unbearable. It sounded like something a ten-year-old would do when playing with audio effects on his computer. The dialogue didn't help, as he spewed out clunky one-liners. Here was Bane, with his terrifying appearance,sounding like a cartoon. It did improve over the ocurse of the movie, but the first introduction to the character was something I almost couldn't shake off.

-Too many character introductions. Maybe this is a criticism of the whole trilogy, but I'll have to put the blame on this one. Too many characters are brought in, with their developments feeling rushed. It almost appears like Nolan adds these new additions to the script at the last minute.

For the most part, the good outweighs the bad. It's a very entertaining film and, as far as summer blockbusters, it's definitely worth the price of admission.

7/10"
"I have seen all of the batman movies (all of them) and saying the The Dark Knight Rises is the best out of any of them is no understatement. Nolan delivers a spectacular conclusion to the best trilogy I've ever witnessed in the cinemas. Every camera shot, order of scenes, and the dialogue was so meticulously delivered, it sets the bar pretty damn close to perfection.

Lets start off with the actors, Christian Bale reprised the role of Batman brilliantly. Failure, redemption, and all the emotions that took part in his character, Bale delivered and did to convincingly. Anne Hathaway, although she had big shoes to fill (pheiffer) did not disappoint. I could see why a younger fresher actress beaten out the likes of Angeline Jolie and Charlize Theron for the role. The Selina Kyle in Nolan's interpretation was cunning, intelligent, beautiful, deadly and yet humane. The veterans (john michael cane, morgan freeman) were fantastic as expected. The real surprise for me was Tom Hardy. The manifestation of Bane. The first thing that came to my mind while I was walking out of the theater was how much fear the character had conveyed. Not only in his own actions but how people reacted to his character. I am sort of tired so I will stop here. I must say though, to all who love bashing movies, save it for another. This movie is one to see. Don't wait for it come out on bluray or download it, go to the theater and watch it. It is not a movie, but an experience."
"I was super excited since the very day when the trailer of the movie came out and was waiting ever eagerly for another master piece by one of the greatest movie makers of all time Christopher Nolan. I was fortunate enough to see it first day. And yes it was not all disappointing as the movie was truly amazing.

The story line woven intricately with all the characters touches you heart, mind and soul and you wish that the experience never ends and keeps you on the edge of the seat till the end of the movie.

Nolan has definitely added another master-piece to his ever-lasting collection and the grand finale will truly leave you spell-bound.

Christian bale as impressive as usual and Tom Hardy plays the Bane flawlessly.

Anna Hathaway does justice so as ever depending Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine. Joseph is also amazing.

Hans Zimmer music leaves is awesome which will be ringing in your ears even after you have left the cinema ! Oh boy, what we all have been waiting for is here and a must see for everyone !!!!!

One of the best trilogies ever made !

YES, THE DARK KNIGHT HAS RISEN !!!! Dey-shey dey-shey Bah-sur-rah bah- sur-rah !!!!!"
"Christopher Nolan does not make simple movie anymore, does he? I was emotionally exhausted right from the start to finish in this captivating 2 hours and 45 minutes of viewing, I barely have time to digest the richness of its storytelling and it lingered in my mind long after experienced it.

The Dark Knight Rises (TDKR) is a fitting epic ending to the most compelling, ambitious superhero movie trilogy ever. In term of audaciousness, the closest I can think of is another DC Comics, Watchmen (Snyder, 2009), without a doubt you are looking at the pinnacle of superhero comic movie adaptation in these two. Both have equal brooding style, Watchmen has a superior narrative style because it is benefited from a direct existing material while Nolan's Batman trilogy punches pure entertainment with accessibility to both general audience and comic geeks.

By the 3rd part of trilogy, gone are the days of the main characters' introduction, where we are straight to the engrossing pay off time.Batman's vehicle evolved from Tumbler who looks like tank to a two-wheels Batpod to The Bat that fly with ease (yes, Lucius Fox confirms that it comes in black colour). The story sets 8 years after the event of The Dark Knight where Bruce Wayne went into long hiatus. The newcomer Anne Hathaway plays the role of Catwoman. Under normal circumstances, she and Catwoman do not belongs to the same bracket, but somehow she pull it off with the seductive performance coupled with the touch of insecurity from her. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays as a closed aide to Commissioner Gordon. Meanwhile, Marion Cottillard is an important figure in Wayne Enterprise.

The main villain, Bane is played by Tom Hardy where his presence on the screen is downright menacing. He is physically tough and hulky. He may not be as intimidating as Joker, but somehow I fear for anyone who is near to him because he seems like he would snap the neck of the person standing next be it his henchmen or enemy. I really felt for Batman during one of the brutal knuckle fight with Bane. He absolutely gives Batman a painful thumping. On the grand scale, he masterminded a sinister plan for the downfall of Gotham City. He strikes the people of Gotham with fear, he actually gives the Gotham citizens some faint hope before striking it down with furious vengeance, all before the eyes of a helpless Bruce Wayne. Given the fleshed out background story, it is obvious Bane is the most complex villain in TDK trilogy.

I am pleased that we are now at the second decade of the golden age of superhero comic movie adaptation where there are plenty of choices we are spoilt of. The sky is the limit as far as CGI is concern, nowadays no matter how transcendent the comic is, the cinema medium just easily lift the concept from the comic book panels. While Joss Whedon's The Avengers is fun, loud, a kind of borderline juvenile stuff, TDKR on the other hand is a serious, realistic, brooding, Gothic feel drama. It stings to say this because I am a huge follower of Joss. Let me reiterate that The Dark Knight Rises is an epitome to action-orientated movie; not just limit to superhero comic adaptation genre. Whoever wants to remake a movie about Batman after Christopher Nolan, I wish him/her best of luck.

My movie review at www.sowyau.blogspot.com/"
"I would like to suggest that researching anything to deep about this film is a bad idea. Go into it with a clean slate. The experience will be ruined for you if you do not.

REVIEW IN SUMMARY:

The movie was phenomenal. It never slows, and I was surprised it was over when the time came. If you've disliked the pacing of past Nolan films, you will be fine with this one. This movie has incredible acting, a beautiful story, and is the perfect end to the Trilogy.

FULL REVIEW:

For starters, the Nolan brothers have created a masterpiece of a script. The themes explored in this film are stirring, and inspiring. The story is beautiful, and full of depth. Those of you looking for a simple mindless thriller will probably find this film to be, ""alright"", but you won't get the hype behind it. You won't understand everyone's obsession with this film. If you haven't liked Nolan's previous work, you won't like this one. It's not about the action, or the simple mindless battles many superhero movies today are all about. It's not as simple as those are. But do not despair, there is more large scale action in this then any of the other Batman films thus far.

But, it is easy to follow. Even if you haven't seen the other movies in the franchise you will understand it. The other movies add depth, so I suggest you see the other two films before you see this one, but all the same you'll be able to follow it.

Chris Nolan tells the story well. It wasn't as choppy and unorganized as some of his past films. This one is by far his best work.

Tom Hardy brings an elegance to the villain of Bane that is addicting. Yes, you read right, and elegance. Class. He is a classy villain, whose motivations are understandable, and frighteningly relatable. This is, in my opinion, his best work aside from Warrior.

As far as comparisons to the Joker go, it's like comparing an apple to an orange. Except when you bight into Bane, and the threat he presents, you'll forget the Joker even existed.

Anne Hathaway won't be disappointing. I know I, like many of you, was worried when we saw that name on the cast list. But she does fine.

This movie will stir your emotions. Satisfy your need for action. Satisfy your need for Batman. And satisfy your need for insurmountable villains. It will also satisfy those who have read the comics. Although this story does not follow in exactness to any original comic, Nolan cleverly manipulates the characters to fit the comic agenda, in a more ""modern"" or ""realistic"" sense.

This film is full of surprises. So I suggest you stop reading these reviews, avoid potential spoilers, and go enjoy the show."
"Title says it all. Epic storyline, perfect musical score, perfect acting, and one of the most emotional endings I have ever seen. This trilogy is the ""star wars"" of our generation. I'm not kidding. Oh, and for all of you IMDb users posting about the plot holes...really? People, it's called ""willing suspension of disbelief"" ever heard of it?

Go see the film and enjoy yourself. This is the one of the only action film I have seen outside of its prequel that doesn't sacrifice story for more explosions. Every character is fully realized and acts their part in such a convincing manner that they become more 3-dimensional than most characters do throughout an entire trilogy.

And Bane? Oh man, Bane is one of the best villains you will ever have the pleasure to see (and quite a well-scripted one too).

This is more than a comic-book film. This is a new classic. The Dark Knight has risen."
"Words cannot express how I felt after watching The Dark Knight Rises.. A sense of hope that even in the most dismal of situations one should have. A sense of relief that this trilogy did not go in the way of most trilogies. A sense of sadness that this would be the last batman movie in the Nolan franchise. But more than all this, I was elated and joyous about the way this movie kept my interest throughout the whole 2 hrs 45 min. To say one word about this film.. EPIC !!! . All the characters completely complimented one another. Was especially astounded by Bale, Hathaway, Hardy and Caine's performances. I am definitely going once again for this one."
"So let me start out with the negatives. This film was the least great of the three in my opinion. It had some major plot holes and confusion at the ending. But that's also something that made it great, because it is an ending that could be interpreted in different ways. So in one way, it could not be seen as a major plot hole although it has in my book. Anywho, the main antagonist Bane is one of my favorites. Find out in the film to see why, because it sure took me by a bit of surprise. On the other hand, some other appearances were quite obvious to be, but still enjoyable nonetheless. In general Christopher Nolan has made an epic trilogy that surely will stay a classic over the years to follow."
I love that this is all one big action sequence it really keeps you on your toes with a lord of the rings type war story for the climax a good movie for someone who looks for a thrill.
"First of all, when I was in the theater watching (The Dark Knight) I said to myself that there's no way I'm going to miss the next movie in this series. after the epic nature and the overwhelming performance also the art of directing that makes you live inside the movie as we have seen in The Dark Knight, I expected this one to be at least the same level and I was absolutely correct. Christopher Nolan is the best Director out there, the way he makes you become part of the movie and feel the same feeling of every character you see is just magical, and add to that the fantastic music of Hans Zimmer, not to mention the Perfect Selection of the Actors and Actresses in this movie. Before The Dark Knight all of us used to watch super hero movies and consider them the kind of thing that would never happen in real life but things changed after the epic clash between batman and the Joker, The Dark Knight Rises even make it more reasonable it makes you think that if there was a batman he would be exactly like this. and it is being proved in each scene as you go through the movie, how hard it is to live with the cruelty of bane, how it is really hard to find weapons and devices to use that they use everything they got (unlike other action movies that everyone suddenly have a 100 gun when it is time to fight) it is like what would really happen if Bane came to your city and Batman was to defend it. in other words you can call this movie a masterpiece,if you didn't watch it yet then what are you waiting for?"
"As everyone i went to this movie with lot of expectations,you know what? Nolan has done an unimaginable Batman movie which can be done only by him. He is a master in what he does.Coming to the movie,from the first frame the movie was absorbing and mind blowing. The Character of Bane was portrayed brilliantly. All the characters does their part 10/10.The twists in the story were awesome and was absolutely unpredictable.The Visual Effects were way too good. Lots of humor in the movie when compared to previous Nolan movies.The combination of classy dialogs and performance of the actors make it the best movie of Nolan so far.To end NOLAN DOES IT AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!:)"
"Immediately, probably, it should be stipulated that I'm not a fan of superhero films, I'm not a fan of comics, and even from cartoons, I'd rather have chosen ""Tom and Jerry"" than a cartoon about Batman. But despite all the first two films of the trilogy described above, I liked them very much. The reason for this is probably the cool, noir atmosphere of Gotem created by the directors, the fine acting and, of course, the good script stories. Well, after such a long introduction, it is logical to ask the question, what about the third part? Nothing! Absolutely nothing! In the final part of the trilogy there is absolutely nothing that I liked in the first two previous parts of the trilogy. The weakest part of the film is probably the script, and this fact is very surprising, as Christopher in all his works spent a lot of time developing the script (which is only the scenario of ""Memento""). Think about the reasons why the script in this picture is so weak you can endlessly. It is worth saying that most of the film is trying to build an exhibition, to reveal the main actors, but the author does not get it in the end, half the time is incredibly boring watching. So the script is so drawn and adjusted for the denouement that it's simply impossible not to notice it, it simply contradicts all laws of logic and healthy meaning. The performances of some scenes are very depressing, many battle scenes also give up cretinism, and it is not clear how they can be looked at. Yes, in the end, Christopher prepared his own story twist, but even he did not work and was predictable and boring. And as for the final scenes, I'm sorry, I could not stand it, how much forgiveness do I have to spit on all the laws of physics, science and just common sense, what would come up with this ?! Well, in general, with the plot all. The second question that arose after watching where the atmosphere of Gotham City had gone? Yes, she just took and evaporated not that noir style for which I loved the first two films of the trilogy, now Gotham is an ordinary boring metropolis, which is simply not interesting to watch. Why was this done or why? There are no answers, alas, it's sad. Well, the last point is an actor's game. Yes, I did not expect something outstanding. In principle, there was nothing outstanding on the screen, all that was that good actors gave out a good game and in sum with the above described it looked again extremely boring and not interesting. It's time to sum up and draw some conclusions. This picture is the weakest in the filmography of a good director Christopher Nolan. As it is not surprising, but basically the script was let down, of course, as a result of which the whole film is simply impossible to watch, the atmosphere and appeal were lost as in the two previous parts of the trilogy. Who can recommend this film, well, probably only to fans of superhero cinema and comic book fans. To all other lovers of good cinema, this film is by no means worth watching. I have everything."
"In my opinion I think this is the best movie of Nolan's Batman trilogy. It's more interesting, enjoyable and emotional. The acting performance is brilliant and the cast has been chosen perfectly. The end is one of the most beautiful endings I've seen, it's phenomenal and remarkable. All things about this movie will still in my memory because it's simply a great masterpiece and I really loved it. Finally if you haven't seen this trilogy yet then I can definitely recommend it."
"I feel The Dark Knight Rises is the best of Nolan's Trilogy in overall entertainment. The hallmark of this series is its dark, gritty realism, at least as realistic as you can get for a superhero movie. I prefer this approach to the semi-goofy style of the 1989-97 series.

Bane's a formidable villain and Anne Hatheway surprisingly plays a good ""Catwoman"" (I say ""surprisingly"" only because I thought she has too innocent/sweet of a quality to pull off the role). Also on hand is Marion Cotillard, who's stunning as Miranda Tate, and Joseph Gordon-Levite, who's effective as police officer Blake. Beyond these we get the principal characters/cast of the first two films, minus the Joker and Harvey Dent.

My only beef with this series is that the plots are convoluted and there's an overload of characters, which means you really have to pay attention or you'll get lost in the process. This is never a problem when a story is ultra-compelling, but none of these films are, although ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is definitely the most compelling of the three. This factor is what keeps this series from being great in my opinion.

But don't take that the wrong way; I'm just being honest. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a quality Batman film.

The film runs 165 minutes and was shot in Pittsburgh (Gotham City), England, Scotland, India, Italy, New York, Newark and California.

GRADE: B+"
"Bane, who sounds like modern day activists who claims to give authority to everyone, wants to distribute everything to everyone and ends up making them indirectly slaves of the authority. On the other hand it shows Bruce really becoming the hero without mask, he learns that fear is good to have as it makes one stronger and vigilant. The way this story is narrated is surreal. For me this is the peak Batman. The character arcs are shown in way, where you can connect with them, the way it shows that all you need is courage to fight the tyranny and heroes do have flaws too. Such superhero movies are gone now in the era of over preaching content and heavy visuals."
Catwoman was mind-blowing..! I saw 3 together..batman begins...dark knight ..and dark knight rises..as per rating dark knight is the best...but in my point of view...this is the best......loved the theory
"The Dark Knight Rises, though not as good as the previous one- The Dark Knight, is fitting for the series finale. In this one, you have Bane and he has great presence throughout the movie and good rivalry with Batman. This one is more about the story and I felt as though this was closer to Batman Begins, as if completing a full circle. In BB, we had Bruce Wayne transform into the Batman and here too he again ""learnt"" to be Batman. He realized that after 8 years of no life at all, he couldn't just don the mask and the cape and become Batman. He again faces fear, learns to overcome it and gets his training in a way.

This movie had a feeling of completeness which is very necessary when the series has ended. The Dark Knight ends in Batman being villain in people's eyes and in this one he literally ""rises""."
This film has the misfortune to be a sequel to one of the greatest films of all time. The Dark Knight is no easy act to follow. However Nolan does an amazing job of adding spectacle to make the final installment of the trilogy memorable. The realism has always made this series stand above the rest. Are there some plot holes? Yes. Do they make it a bad film? No. Go watch Justice League then honestly tell me TDKR is bad. It's not. It is simply over shadowed by its predecessor.
Oh my god this movie was awesome !.and what an amazing ending to a superb trilogy.this movie Can't get better the story the cast everything is just too perfect.and no one is better than Chrestian Bale for this movie he is a very talented actor with a really special acting skills.i am confused why anyone well hate this movie its one of the best movie for all ages ! in my opinion its the best action movie of 2012.and of course the well directing and superb special effects of the movie makes it more amazing.what a blockbuster movie is this.this movie is no doubt a most watch and best of the year and it deserved an Oscar at least.
"Christopher Nolan concludes his epic vision of the Batman franchise in high style, as Christian Bale returns as the caped crusader, after masked henchman Bane threatens to destroy Gotham. This stuff is candy for superhero aficionados, and Nolan manages to balance a large cast without shortchanging anyone. Drawn from his slumber by mysterious cat burglar Selina Kyle, the Batman faces what may be his biggest and most dangerous test yet as Bane wields a nuclear explosive and threatens to detonate. Secrets from the past are revealed, and loose ends tied. Tremendous support from Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Mariana Cotilliard, and others. This is a film to make you stand up and cheer. Fun comic fable, perhaps not up to the standard of the prior classic, but does amazing things with it's large budget and well worth viewing."
"The action was pretty mediocre at best. The plot was decent but most things were pretty predictable. Even the ""surprise"" evil villain at the end was predictable. During the movie I turned to my girlfriend and said ""$20 says she ends up being a bad guy at the end."" needless to say I got a pat on the head later.

Is the movie good? Yes. Is the movie great? Depends.... it is great for the fans of the movies but in general its not a masterpiece. I feel it deserve a 8 on IMDb at the very best. The fact that its so high rated right now is pretty unrealistic.

Everyone saying Bane was the greatest villain of all time with amazing acting? I disagree... I still think Heath did a better job as the Joker. I feel Bane was a cool character but I don't feel he at all lived up to the hype provided in other reviews.

The movie is a must see for the year, but it is something you can watch on DVD and still get the same effect. No idea how they spent so much money on this movie... the action wasn't that good."
"Christopher Nolan is the greatest film maker of all time. Big statement, I know. But let's think about that statement for a second... he has not made a bad film (Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins, The Prestige, The Dark Knight, Inception and his earlier work Following) So how does such a brilliant film maker finish off a trilogy that changed super hero movies forever, which included one of the greatest films (in any genre - The Dark Knight) of all time?

The Dark Knight Rises is the conclusion the trilogy deserves. Is it better than The Dark Knight? That's debatable. It's a very different type of movie. But it is the movie that was needed to end this trilogy, it's the movie that Batman fans will appreciate and love for years and years to come.

Christopher Nolan has just possibly made the greatest movie trilogy of all time."
"The unprecedented fervor surrounding the release of the final Batman film of Christopher Nolan's highly acclaimed trilogy is something we probably should have seen coming. Fans of the films are rabid about the movies getting their just dues, and it's become the (unfortunate) habit of many a fanboy to go ballistic on anyone who is a naysayer. That said, these people are devotees of the series for a reason: each of the two previous offerings have been nothing short of fantastic, and there was no reason to believe that the third—and final—installment, The Dark Knight Rises, would be any different.

The question that's on everyone's mind, of course, is if it really does meet (and ultimately exceed) the impossibly high standards set by its predecessors. The answer is a resounding ""yes."" The Dark Knight Rises is incredibly ambitious and incredibly satisfying; it's also the best film of the trilogy.

Allow me to explain why.

In both Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, Gotham was in peril. Madmen assailed the city's citizens for varying reasons—some more concrete than others—while a troubled hero in Bruce Wayne sought to use his resources (namely access to incredibly advantageous weaponry and a whole slew of kick-assery he obtained while a brief member of the League of Shadows) to disarm those would see the town destroyed. While his character has always been interesting, Bruce Wayne hasn't been a truly engrossing dramatic figure. That all changes with The Dark Knight Rises.

Here, we see Bruce/Batman's tragedy and redemption come around full circle. At the start of the movie, Wayne is a man crippled by the exploits he's undertaken as the caped crusader. He's a recluse who's holed up in Wayne Manor. As we're allowed to see him move beyond exchanging witty barbs with his longtime butler (and caretaker) Alfred Pennyworth, the emotional pay-dirt finally emerges, and the character—in the words of the late Ra's Al Ghul—becomes more than just a man. He becomes the embodiment of grief; here, it's clear that there's a tangible psychological block that's eating Bruce from the inside out. The first hour of Rises is devoted to mining this pain, and it makes Bale's portrayal of Bruce more accessible than ever.

Then there's the action, which hits its stride about halfway through the production. Once it gets going, it's relentless and, for lack of a better word, harrowing. Everything that's happening in the streets of Gotham has weight behind it, as the city faces a challenge unlike anything that's come before.

I feel like I'm on the verge of spilling the beans about some major plot points, so I'll wind things down by saying that the supporting cast—Tom Hardy as Bane and Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle—are all splendid. They each bring something crucial to their characters, and not a moment of screen time is wasted.

I don't need to tell you this, but if you haven't already purchased your ticket for Nolan's epic conclusion to what will go down as one of the best trilogies in movie history, then you need to get on the ball. After all, this is one of those rare occurrences in cinema—the emergence of a truly great movie that actually lives up to every ounce of hype.

Nicely done, Mr. Nolan. You deserve the Oscar nods that are surely coming your way."
"Never has a comic book film make you care about the main character especially throughout a trilogy, these movies should be viewed as one big film, it all adds up and comes to full circle in this one. The acting alone in this movie hits you hard and when Bane appears on the screen it's nail biting. From Christian Bale, Tom Hardy, Ann Hathaway, Michael Caine, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Gary Oldman the list goes on and they make this movie well worth it.

You really feel for Bruce Wayne the most in this movie (because its a batman film) and the ending has the best pay off ever and is very emotional and satisfying. One of the best things about this movie is when you watch it more than once you pick up on things you may have missed which i find more gratifying in a movie, its like watching it all over again and those movies to me are the best, its definitely not a one and done type of movie so you get your moneys worth. This movie definitely deserves the praise it has. Its going to be a long time until someone makes a comic book trilogy as brilliant as this one. Thank you Nolan."
"The special fx and action scenes were cool. The acting by the badguy was not that great. One of the reasons for that was the mask he is wearing. You cant really see the facial expressions and also the voice acting was clearly recorded in studio afterwards. The bad guy visually looking is really cool. The badguy is not that great compared to the previous movie where heat ledger really carried the movie, tom hardy doesn't. Also the storyline and screenplay wasn't that good. They tried to put to much info in to short a time. The characters where a bit shallow because of that, they lacked depth. All in all the movie was entertaining, but not as much as expected."
"First things first. Bane is not the Joker. While the Joker was chaotic,Baneis a mercenary. Ruthless and destructive. When the prologue was shown during MI4, many had voiced concerns about the muffled voice of Bane.That has been corrected to an extent.For those who don't follow comic books,Bane is the villain who broke the bat. And Tom Hardy has done justification to Bane. Mind you when there is a mask covering your face and you sound as a megaphone, it makes your job a little difficult. But his physical presence and his eyes expresses what needs to be expressed.

Before you walk into the theatre, ensure that you seen the previous two films from the trilogy as the story of TDKR is interconnected to both and you may feel lost if you haven't seen them. For those who have , it wouldn't harm to review those films again. Whilst The Dark Knight earned respect and love from worldwide audience mostly due to fact that Heath Ledger was brilliant as the Joker. And his character shines way above Batman's or the story itself, TDKR on the other hand relies more on the story and the inter-relationship of the characters.

Nolan stands true to his word. It is an EPIC conclusion to the Batman trilogy. it is worthy of multiple viewings and I would suggest an IMAX viewing if possible. The scenes, the canvas are breathtaking. So are all the action scenes and of course Mr.Zimmer on the keyboard. The soundtrack fits right into the scenes and enhances the visual experience. The newly added star cast further adds to that experience and fit right into the master puzzle that Nolan has created while his old allies ensure that the movies moral compass is pointed in the right direction. The movie justifies its length of 165 mins and you won't realise how fast they went.

For me the experience would have been far more richer had I not seen Inception or any other Nolan films. Let me explain. Many of the movie scenes are executed and directed on the same lines as Inception. And since I understand how Nolan's concept works, I knew all the twist and turns before they were revealed barring one. The element of surprise wasn't there for me. TDKR is a must watch. And it is a just end to the best comic book adapted movie series ever. Enjoyed it and loved it. Rating 8/10."
"Following a movie event like Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" (2008) is a dangerous game, but then Nolan is a dangerous player. His curious obsession with masculine identity, psychological schisms and the dark night of the soul gave ""Batman Begins"" (2005) a sense of edgy 'reality' that ingratiated him to critics and a good deal of the public, even if it alienated some hard-core Batfans with its customized and highly Nolan-esque take on the Caped Crusader. When his second installment braved the frontier of openly post-9/11 superhero parables, and in so doing gave the late Heath Ledger platform to truly wow audiences and critics the world over, the British director seemed to have galvanized 'superhero noir' as the new benchmark in comic book film adaptation. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012) is his final word on the subject, and while this reviewer feels that it is not a film fit to win over any dissenters or greatly deter any fanatics, it is very largely successful in what it tries to do and its failings are certainly not for a lack of trying.

The first hour or so of the film is a whirlwind of plot necessities that, despite the running time of 165 minutes, probably needed another half an hour or so to unfold with sensicality. They involve introductions to John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) - a rookie cop raised in a city orphanage who apparently ""still believes in the Batman"", even though as far as the audience is concerned he may as well have just moved to Gotham last week – Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) – a cat-burglar who is therefore Catwoman – and Miranda Tate (Marion Cottilard) – a high society Gothamite monetarily invested in a renewable energy program at Wayne Enterprises that has apparently gone bust, even though it seems to work just fine. Excusing a twist in the tale that seems to be there for its own sake, however, Nolan and his co-screenwriter (also known as his brother Jonathan) do not really abide loose ends, and by the commencement of the film's some hour-long climax all the story elements that feel disparate and murky in the beginning have intertwined and solidified into the kind of philosophically powerhouse narrative that made the first two films so effective.

What makes the Nolan films effective is how they appropriated the inalienable tenets of the Batman legend in pursuit of an apocalyptic allegory about the post-9/11 western world. ""Batman Begins"" was a film about fear; the double edged nature of fear's power over a people and how the conquering of fear is invaluable for the pilgrimage of moral valor. ""The Dark Knight"" was a film about Terror, the kind George Bush Jr. declared war against in the early twenty-first century, and about how the greatest tool against Terror is the adherence to moral principles, even if sacrifice and compromise must be allowed for.

""The Dark Knight Rises"" provides a more accurate depiction of terroristic motives in its central villain of Bane than the ""The Dark Knight"" did with The Joker, because he holds Gotham in contempt for its status as a symbol of American first-world 'imperialism'. There has been some critical backlash against Bane as a Villain Without A Face, but this severely undermines Tom Hardy's performance, which actually achieves remarkable presence through nothing but body-language, vocal theatricality and disturbingly expressive eyes. Even without a face, Hardy effortlessly paints a convincing portrait of one who wants to dismantle the lie of Harvey Dent's legacy and incite Gotham into class-warfare riots. He purports to ""liberate"" Gotham's people, but his ultimate goal is to feed Gotham false hope before destroying the whole darn thing and everyone in it. Bane's genuine ideological conflict with western civilization is centered around the power of hope in the eventuation of despair. More than it is a film about fear or Terror, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a film about hope.

In accord with the rest of the trilogy, Bruce Wayne is not the only protagonist whose arc is built around the movie's central thematic concepts. Even the arc supplied for Selina Kyle ends up justifying her seemingly arbitrary insertion into this filmic imagining by providing a suitably dubious object of moral faith for the fallen Dark Knight. She begins with similar outlook to Bane, but the Nolans don't buy into Ra's Al Ghul's assertion that criminals aren't complicated. Everyone, and everything, is complicated.

Oddly enough, it's this principle that is behind most of the shortcomings of the film. It's a little *too* complicated, with the rushed series of first-act events seriously paling in comparison to the emotional impact of the conclusion, and an aforementioned twist that doesn't make much sense. There are also a lot more impossible feats performed by Bruce Wayne here than before, including a near-superhuman healing ability. And where ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"" stood alone very effectively, one can't help but feel that both films are practically required viewing for this one.

But none of that really outweighs the sheer, touching veracity of this finale and its philosophical/moral ambitions, which are all up to par with the predecessors and pay off a great deal of things with a genuine craftsmanship. This ""Batman"" series has always been about the power of symbols in a corrupted world and personal accountability in a society of structural shackles, and when Batman returns to Gotham at the top of the final act to brand his symbol in flames upon the city's largest bridge structure, we are reminded of the paradoxical purity of his message. Even as part of a system that is broken, even funded by a wealth that would perhaps do more good dispersed amongst the third world, even if no one ever knows his name, the Batman fights for the goodness of fallen people (be they cops, cat-burglars or orphans) who may otherwise have never had the chance to rise."
"This movie has everything you could want all while wrapping up one of the best film trilogies. As far as bad guys go Bane is pretty much the epitome of the character type. I personally feel the villains in the trilogy is what makes them so special. The story is great and engaging, it was so good I didn't even realize that the runtime was over 2 hours. If you like dark, gritty, and/or action movies its a must watch. Also it should be noted that you should watch the first 2 films in the series otherwise some stuff might not add up. It wraps up everything in the trilogy and answers pretty much every question you could have. How it relates back to the first movie is quite impressive and after watching this one you'll probably try your best 'bane impression.' His voice is as memorable as his stature. So even if you don't like Batman you must watch it for Bane because he is that amazing. Props to Tom Hardy on his out of the park performance."
"First of all, can I say that when I heard that the Joker wasn't going to be in this movie and that the lead ""bad guy"" was going to be Bane I was thinking ""LAME"". So I tried to go into watching this film with an open mind and I got to say I won't question Chris Nolan's casting, direction or choice of characters again anytime soon. The man is a master and did a masterful job in this third installment of the Batman saga. Bane is an enemy in which Batman has not yet seen, he's physically strong sure but his genius and ruthlessness is truly what's terrifying. He breaks Batman time and again until you almost question whether Batman can really beat him in the end (which is saying something, because we all know he has to right?). The choices of the other actors like Anne Hathaway were spot on, she was magnificent and nailed the cat women character this movie required to succeed. Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Christian Bale were their own usual selves (exceptional) and I really didn't see anyone miscast or turn in anything other then a very strong performance. Overall this movie left me completely happy, the perfect ending to the perfect movie saga. These are not just great super hero movies, to me they're great films period."
"The Dark Knight Rises was my favorite film of the year and from the Dark Knight trilogy.I was looking forward to this movie and it didn't disappoint me.

Positive:epic action scenes ,great acting performances, very good villain emotional ending ,inspiring movie

Negative: some plot wholes that didn't affect me.

Overall the movie was fantastic and I think that it is the one of the best movies ever made.Long live the Batman! Eight years on, a new evil rises from where the Batman and Commissioner Gordon tried to bury it, causing the Batman to resurface and fight to protect Gotham City... the very city which brands him an enemy"
"Am not a great FAN of Super Hero movies, but Nolan Changed the entire mindset. Of course the Film has a lot of loop holes and glitches but that doesn't take away the edge of the seat thrilling heartbeat experience. What i loved most was the way a simple comic story was presented on the screen. I really appreciate Nolan's creativity and presentation.What one needs was an awesome experience and not 100% logic to Action movies. The film stand all amid all minor glitches. The film has a lot of positives, The way Bruce & Tom Hardy character was portrayed, The way Real New York city was presented, The way the Whole experience stood at the end especially Bruce climbing out of the Well. Hans Zimmer Played a wonderful part in giving a master piece. All in All i would recommend everyone to watch whether they like it or not but for the cinematic experience it gives in the end. A Comic Super Hero Movie depicted magnificently after a lot of flops earlier. Nolan has silently conveyed that he is the right man who can do it."
"I just love a good superhero movie, so I happily saw the two Tim Burton offerings (""Batman"" & ""Batman Returns"") and even the pair of inferior Joel Schumacher works (""Batman Forever"" & ""Batman & Robin"") before thoroughly enjoying the British director Christopher Nolan's ""Batman Begins"" (2005) and ""The Dark Knight"" (2008). Four years later, Nolan - who again co-wrote and co-produced - is back with the final and longest part of his acclaimed trilogy. The expectations were very high and Nolan does not disappoint (and deserves particular thanks for not using 3D).

The opening sequence - which I saw in an early trailer - is terrific and almost the best thing in the film and Nolan makes sure that the rest of the story races along with verve and tension, aided by Hans Zimmer's incessant, throbbing score.

It's eight years after the last film and Bruce Wayne (once more the talented Christian Bale) is a broken man, physically, psychologically and even financially. Two contrasting characters arrive in Gotham City to draw him out of retirement: a slinky cat thief (well played by Anne Hathaway who has the most humorous lines) and arch villain Bane (a fearsome-looking Tom Hardy whose lines are unfortunately muffled by his face mask). The Bane character may not be in quite the same chilling class as the brilliant Heath Ledger as The Joker, but Catwoman is a splendid addition to the cast list.

I didn't always understand what was going on - a recent viewing of the two previous films might have helped (who remembers the League of Shadows?) - and I saw it with a friend who was enjoying it for the second time and found the plot more intelligible, so that may be encouragement - if any was needed - to catch it again sometime. But the film always looks wonderful and the action is exciting and unrelenting, satisfyingly alternating from brutally visceral fighting between Batman and Bane to the deployment of some heavy hardware including a bat bike and a bat helicopter.

So, now that Nolan has triumphantly completed his trilogy, does this mean that the crusader is hanging up his cape? No way. The money to be made by continuing the franchise and the setting up of the Robin character (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) means that some other director will soon receive the call from Warner Brothers ..."
"""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012) is the third and final film in Christopher Nolan's trilogy about the comic book superhero Batman, created in 1939 by Bill Finger and Bob Kane. The franchise, starting in 2005 with ""Batman Begins"" and continuing in ""The Dark Knight"" (2008) is brought to a conclusion, and traditional Hollywood thinking is used by the Warner Bros. Studio here: everything is bigger, louder and more explosive and with higher stakes than before. Yet this expansionism hasn't translated into greater quality; if anything, it is the most flawed of the trio. Continuity errors, plot holes and logic defying events plague the film incessantly. The screenplay, by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, feels like it is two or three drafts away from being a finished product. Geopolitical significance is constantly strived for, especially in the latter part of the film, yet it fails to fully grasp its own half-articulated ideas and ends feeling like the pat, smug ""safe"" hawkish ideologies of a studio executive more interested in profit margins than ideas. All these mistakes are a repetition of the previous entry in the series; in many ways this perfectly encapsulates Hollywood: nothing forgotten, nothing learnt.

Still, Nolan's direction is as impressive as ever, really delivering in the large scale set pieces that dot the picture. He brings a real energy to the screen that almost papers over the cracks in the story. The dynamic action scenes are hardly original though and the opening sequence is straight out of a James Bond movie.

The acting is generally of a high standard, with Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Tom Hardy all very good. Unfortunately, the Oscar winning Marion Cotillard is given nothing to do and struggles to create a performance out of a poorly written character.

The cinematography by Academy Award winner Wally Pfister is good and a cut above the usual standard found in the average superhero blockbuster, the same of which can be said for the editing by Lee Smith and the booming music score of Hans Zimmer.

If then this climax to the Batman series is a disappointment, torpedoed by a below par script, then at least Christopher Nolan directs so well that you will be immersed in the film to the point where perhaps you will be more forgiving of its flaws and be swept along by this enjoyable spectacle."
"Wow. Christoper Nolan's third Batman-film is certainly not praised without good reasons, I assure you. The film leaves you speechless, the action combined to great actors and twisty plot, it's just pure beauty. Cannot say any negative thing about this film. Was surpirsed to see so many great actors, including old Stargate-star Christopher Judge in the side role. Can't give away much, so I'm not writing any more. I'm just saying, watch it as soon as you can!"
"The disappointment of the year. could not imagine the duo of nolan brothers getting it wrong. this movie should have been titled "" Cat woman and Bane"" because Batman is just an impotent shadow of his old time over here. Cat woman aka Selina Kyle is given the major amount of the screen time and Hathway is a pretty competent Catwoman. Bane(Tom Hardy) is unfortunately all masked up so he can convey the menace only from the way he walks or talks in that Irish lilt. Michael Caine is excellent in the scenes he is in and so is Morgan Freeman. Marion cotillard is totally wasted. i could not really understand the necessity for her character in the movie and also could not fathom why an Oscar winning actor like her would go for such a two bit role. Joseph Gordon Lewitt creases his forehead throughout the movie and that is pretty much all he does. Christian Bale is above average but he cannot lift a screenplay which is weak and predictable from the very beginning. the only bright spot about the movie is its music which is better than the previous installments. This movie is a disappointment when considered in seclusion. when compared with The Dark Knight and Batman Begins, it is a f**king disaster. very very unhappy."
"That Completes the trilogy.. Just came out from 'The Dark Knight Rises'...Not as mesmerizing as The Dark Knight ,but still Christopher Nolan executed a legendary ending to the series with breathtaking visual moments and fine performances..the movie takes off slowly ,bt the racy 2nd half s just stunning...Hans Zimmer 's score is brutal, percussive and ma ear drums was busting , the Bane Chant wherever he used was goosebumps..Christian Bale continued his legacy in the third part too.. Tom Hardy was a beefy substitute for Heath Ledger in a hell of a villain as the merciless and destructive evil.. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman reprise's there roles as strong as it's been throughout the series.. Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a fair job as the detective and he s a promising actor and the shocking 'Rise' was Marion Cotillard as 'Miranda Tate'..Anne Hatheway as CatWoman was just a sidekick and nothing much performance wise from her We may never see superhero films quite like these again, and that's fine.Nolan had ended on his own terms..If plans arise to reboot the ""Batman"" films a few years from now, I wish you luck. The bar is as high as it could possibly be... Must Watch for all Dark Knight and Nolan and movie lovers..!!"
"one of the most rewarding movies not only for having a realistic life story but also for watching a true hero who gets up on his feet at the end regardless how badly hurt ed he was he's still there

a true hero don't always have to had super powers but rather a Strong willing heart to take the right decisions at the right time & knows when to quit.

never give up

accept the truth about your self

even super heroes must know the feeling of fear sometimes to be true heroes"
"Billionaire Bruce Wayne once said, ""I am moreit's what you do that defines you."" The question is: what defines us all? The fire has risen and that fire has been put out, but not yet though. One thing still remains: Is there a future for the billionaire playboy? Enough about playboys, let's chat about how we got here.

In 2005, we were re-introduced to a boy who fell down a well and we saw what frightened him the most – bats. But he overcame that fear and struck fear into the hearts of those that knew the very existence of fear. Fighting against the mob, Batman took down the biggest crime lords of Gotham City – Carmine Falcone and gave the Scarecrow a taste of his own medicine.

But in 2008, the war was not over, not even by a landslide. As Bruce Wayne was having battles of his own, Batman was posed as a threat to the city and plus a mastermind of theatricality, a brain as the size of a laughing matter, brought a new taste in life – SLAUGHTER WAS THE BEST MEDICINE! The Joker (RIP Heath!), portrayed one of the darkest villains of all time as he brought down upon the city and the new DA Harvey Dent and gave the word ""light"" a new name.

Now we come to 2012, no one expected this to come to a conclusion, we thought we were in it for the long haul. Let's just say it was bittersweet and a whole lot of punches and back breaking. The ultimate villain, Bane, gave violence a new name. A name that was synomous unlike any other. But Bane was not working alone. An arch-enemy came back to finish a job but through someone else. And the black was faded and billionaire was living his life and moving on. But wait something red approaches, something that will fly red colors – is it a red monster, is it a red wagon, no it is a RED ROBIN.

For 8 years, the mastermind of Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathon gave Batman a new look and took the story to a whole new level. Thank you for teaching us that it is what we do that defines us. Christian Bale – you gave us an icon to live up to, you taught us to live for ourselves. Thank you. From Cillian Murphy to Tom Wilkinson to the late Heath Ledger to Aaron Eckhart to Tom Hardy to Anne Hathaway to Marion Cotillard – you guys defined evil. Thank you.

Batman will live in our hearts for years to come."
"I'll start by saying two things: 1. I am a huge Batman fan, in all shapes and sizes (well, except the Joel Schumacher movies); I read the comics, watched the animated series and movies and the live action movies 2. I am intelligent enough to spot plot holes, unrealistic action scenes and 'forced' plot devices.

With those disclaimers in mind, most people who criticize this film would imagine I must hate it. And, yet, it's quite the opposite.

I've just finished watching this for the 3rd time in 2 years. Yes, it's true that, the more often you watch it, the easier it is to spot things that seem off. To look at the details and to start questioning.

But...I really don't care. None of that makes this movie any less special for me. Because, truly, this movie goes to such emotional depths and gets you so in touch with the heart of what it means to be the Batman, that anything else is overshadowed.

The appeal and curse of Batman as a character is that he is human. He suffers and makes mistakes. He can be broken. He doesn't have super strength or the ability to fly. What he does have, beyond the training and the money and being 'the world's greatest detective', is his determination. His unwavering motivation to fight and win for his cause, to make Gotham safe at any cost. That's his superpower - never giving up.

And, on top of that, he has a lot of pain and trauma; the kind that any human being will experience, at some point in their life, that is now out in the open for anyone to sympathize with.

For capturing those things and putting them on screen so beautifully, I am grateful to Mr. Nolan."
"The Dark Knight Rises (2012) is my third best movie. Anne Hathaway was awesome fantastic as Catwoman she portrayed her by comic books the way she was. Michelle Pfeiffer did not do the job by portraying Catwoman by comic books but she did knew how to hit back. Bane played by Tom Hardy was absolutely fantastic terrorist. The Dark Knight Rises is pretty good awesome movie! The third Christopher Nolan film is very bashed and criticized by fan boys of Burton films saying it isn't good as Burton Batman films were. I love The Dark Knight Rises a little much better than Batman Returns, but those 4. films I reviewed will be my four favorite films. Schumacher films suck and they aren't my favorite films.

Anne Hathaway's performance is a worth of watch in this movie. Selina Kyle was written straight from the comic books the way her origins were. I love her in this movie she was well portrayed by Anne Hathaway, the way she was written in a comic books. Christian Bale still lighten us all up in his performance as Batman/Bruce Wayne. Matthew Modine and Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a wonderful performances in their co starring roles. This movie still has a plot holes like Batman dies in the end but he doesn't, Bruce Wayne survives. Alfred disappears magically during half of this movie and he show's up on the end of the movie. Anne Hathaway did a much, much better job than Michelle Pfeiffer did. Bane was a scary villain but still a good comic book portrayed villain the way he was. Tom Hardy was truly great in his performance as the main villain Bane. Seriously I have enjoyed this movie much better as a I did Batman Begins. Still The Dark Knight is the best one of all Batman Films. A good conclusion to end the trilogy.

The Dark Knight Rises is a 2012 British-American epic superhero film directed by Christopher Nolan, who co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Jonathan Nolan, and the story with David S. Goyer. Featuring the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the final installment in Nolan's Batman film trilogy, and the sequel to Batman Begins (2005) and The Dark Knight (2008).

Taking place eight years after the events of ""The Dark Knight"", the film follows Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) once more as he is forced to come out of self-imposed exile when a new evil rises in Gotham. This time around, the Caped Crusader must face off against his most dangerous enemy yet, a ruthless masked crime lord known as Bane (Tom Hardy), who will stop at nothing to bring chaos to the city. He must also deal with the arrival of a mysterious cat burglar named Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), as well as his inner demons. He may have defeated the Joker, but does Batman even stand a chance against Bane?

Eight years after the Joker's reign of anarchy, the Dark Knight is forced to return from his imposed exile to save Gotham City from the brutal guerrilla terrorist Bane with the help of the enigmatic Catwoman.

It's hard to imagine a time when a Christopher Nolan-helmet Batman film wasn't a sure thing. Yes it does.

Warner Bros. Pictures' and Legendary Pictures' ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is the epic conclusion to filmmaker Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy.

Christopher Nolan's concluding vision of the legendary Caped Crusader may just possibly go down as one of the strongest closing chapters to any franchise in modern cinema. Not only is it one of the most entertaining blockbusters of the year, but it also expands upon the Batman saga in a way that keeps you both emotionally and intellectually invested until the very end. With its top-notch performances, breathless score, solidly engrossing storyline, and action-packed set pieces, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" ends the franchise on a satisfying high note, delivering one of the most powerfully engrossing climaxes in recent memory. Anne Hathaway also deserves major props for her portrayal of the cunning Catwoman, who (in my opinion) is even more striking than Michelle Pfeiffer.

Although ""The Dark Knight Rises"" never truly reaches the same groundbreaking heights as its predecessor, I loved every minute of it. The fantastic storytelling, the gritty visuals, the brilliant character development. There's nothing here that isn't worthy of praise in my book. Nolan truly capped off his one-of-a-kind superhero trilogy in a way that no other director could've accomplished. Sure, the narrative can get a bit messy at times, but when compared to everything else the film does right, it hardly matters. I don't recommend this film , because it isn't for everyone. But for any fan of dark, gritty, action-packed filmmaking it is.

R.I.P. to all the victims of the Theater Massacre in Aurora, Colorado. They will be missed.

"The Dark Knight Rises is a 2012 action film directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Oscar-winning Christian Bale as Batman and Tom Hardy as Bane. It was a box office success with total earnings more than $1 billion.

Eight years after the events of The Dark Knight, Batman seems to have retired. But when a new evil force named Bane arrives in Gotham and intends to destroy the city, Batman has to rise again. His allies are few, but he is willing to do whatever it takes to save his city and its people...

One of the best features of the film is its special effects; also why I enjoyed it so much. They were all amazingly good, with the stadium explosion being one of the top movie scenes this year!

What's more, another point I have to mention is the acting; Bale is as convincing as ever, while Hardy is the perfect villain. The rest of the cast, including Anne Hathaway as Catwoman and Gary Oldman as Comissioner Gordon remains at its finest.

All in all, I found the film more enjoyable than any other this year. So, don't waste time-grab your popcorn, your friends and watch it. In my opinion though, you should already have done so!"
"If you've had enough of Batmen because of the likes of Val Kilmer and George Clooney, then you haven't enjoyed Christian Bale in director Christopher Nolan's trilogy of Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, and now the superior Dark Knight Rises. Bale brings the anguish and triumph of a real human being who suffers and overcomes his sorrows to fight the forces of evil—the American way.

While that way is too often by way of violence in movies, this iteration, where Bruce Wayne returns from self-exile to fight the fearful Bane (Tom Hardy), is more often punctuated by intelligence (in weapon designs and mostly in strategy). In fact, the violence is frequently mundane fist fighting, almost as if to emphasize guile over missile. Sadly, the two battles between Batman and Bane are so dull that I longed for CGI to elevate the sophistication. Body blows hardly satisfy in this high-tech world.

Characteristic of Nolan, the bad guys are memorable and formidable: Bane has a mask to remind us of Darth Vader with his power and darkness, actually coming from a pit of darkness as if from some Poe-like tale of terror; Catwoman (Anne Hathaway) is witty, slippery, and mercurial while sporting a figure Hathaway must have worked hard to fashion; and the surprise villain, well, is more vicious than the others because of the ultimate disguise (not to be disclosed here for fear of my being thrown into the naughty-critic pit).

Then there's Alfred (Michael Caine), Bruce Wayne's faithful servant, whose soul is almost as tortured as Wayne's. Caine is called on to shed a few tears, which are more believable than all the CGI machines. I wouldn't be surprised if Caine gains an Oscar nomination for supporting role (he won two Oscars already). As for Joseph Gordon-Levitt's cop, John Blake, he is subtly effective in gaining our sympathy so that he is guaranteed to return in the next Batman production.

I am unusually effusive about the acting because it is so good, but I should not forget that themes are always prominent in this series. Global financial failure, loyalties, and warfare; and, of course, the ambiguity of human beings, symbolized by masks, keep this comic-book thriller from sinking in its own weight of explosions and bombast.

The Amazing Spider-Man impressed me a few weeks ago because it caught squarely the young person's challenges of self-centered arrogance and growing maturity thorough responsibility. Now The Dark Knight Rises shows the inner struggles of an adult hero racked with doubt, more inclined to forsake responsibility than to save humanity. As for the Avengers, it now looks like a showcase for costumes at a Comic-Con convention.

Nolan and Bale have caught the angst of adults everywhere who, when confronted with financial ruin or the need to defend their turf from alien forces, may bail out rather than face down the evils. Despite the questionably-long 164 minutes, the artists of this film have kept every minute interesting, fast-paced, and highly useful to develop a pride of heroes who should keep us entertained for at least next decade."
"I went to see the Dark Knight Rises last week and I have to say I was impressed. Story-wise it's a lot better than it's predecessors. The plot is coherent and has several interesting twists along the way that I won't spoil for you here. My only complaint is that it is a bit heavy going at some points. 3 hours is a long time, and I wouldn't go so far as to say boring, but it definitely takes a while to pick up the pace. However once it does you are in for a thrill ride.

Nolan did a fantastic job with the Characters, from the troubled Bruce Wayne/Batman to Catwoman to the antagonist Bane, as well as secondary characters such as Alfred and Gordon, they are all fleshed out beautifully and are very believable in respect to the source material. Supplemented by superb acting by the all star cast, I have no complaints here.

The direction is fantastic. As I said above, it takes a while to pick up, but it never ever get's boring. As soon as you start to think that, something happens that pulls you right back in. Nolan deserves to be commended for this. The action scenes are brilliantly done, the special effects are great, Hans Zimmer's score is, as always, superb, the editing and cinematography are crisp. There really is not much to complain about here.

In my personal opinion it is the best installment in the Nolan trilogy, and if you haven't seen it yet I can only recommend you do so as soon as possible."
"Didn't think this film lived up to the hype surrounding it. It was good, don't get me wrong but it didn't compare with the Dark Knight. Seemed too full of action and definitely violence, which obscured the story somewhat.However Christian Bale played a blinder again and he has definitely made the role his and his alone. Nobody would be able to compare to him. The ending was again a bit rushed and didn't really come as any surprise, and again this let down the overall film. Sets up another series, which would have to be exceptional to compare. But overall a let down and not a fitting end to this franchise. Let's hope the Man Of Steel (another DC offering) will strengthen the comic lines takings as the Green Lantern certainly didn't. Sorry, the Avengers will be the box office topper this year!"
"A mediocre comic book film. While decent at times, there are too many patches of poor dialog the bring out poor performances from the actors. While Bruce Wayne is reluctant to put back on the bat suit, Bale seems equally reluctant to put on his Bruce Wayne suit. His performance is entirely uninteresting and he never seems to recover any fire. 

Hathaway does a fair job, but she and Bale lack chemistry. A scene with Levitt is so poorly written and performed it is painful to watch. 

Bane is never menacing. It sounds like he is impersonating Jeremy Irons from Die Hard 3. He also does this ridiculous head shake during his speech, as if to insure the audience that he is speaking. 

The tie in to A Tale of Two Cities is obvious and ham fisted.  There is so little build up to the behavior the citizens quickly adopt that  it just fails to make itself plausible. While the personal sacrifice from A Tale of Two Cities makes that story powerful, the cop out in this film weakens the whole story.  

Some of the action scenes are pretty good. Some are just ridiculous. Batman always seems like some guy in a suit who is fighting a creepy guy with a mask. 

Overall this movie just fails to ever become compelling."
"You just don't watch a Nolan movie. You experience it. Something happens inside you after you're done watching any of his movies.

The Dark Knight Rises is not just a movie, its a baggage of expectations, its a sequel to The Dark Knight, it has been directed by Chris Nolan, it has the Batman and people have already started with their assumptions and speculations.

Does the movie survive all this?

Yes. Definitely yes.

Batman Begins dealt with fear. The Dark Knight dealt with chaos. The Dark Knight Rises deals with pain.

Eight years have been passed since the demise of Harvey Dent. Batman had hung up the boots and started blaming himself for Harvey's Death and everything. With all the injuries he had sustained while fighting under that bat suit and the depression, he is no longer the Bruce Wayne Gotham knows. People have been questioning his sanity. Wayne empire is declining.

In comes Bane. The dark, brutal, masked and monolithic beast who almost destroys Wayne enterprises to seek Batman.

Selina Kyle, a female burglar who teases Bruce Wayne with her attitude and activities.

As a result, Batman is forced to come back. What follows is the series of events that not only blow your mind away but cast a magical spell to last the full life time.

There are a several new players that have been introduced in the film, such as Wayne's love interest and the new age cop John Blake who does the job of being the good side kick of Gordon and plays in an important role in convincing Bruce Wayne to be back as the caped crusader to protect Gotham one last time from the terror of Bane and army.

So is The Dark Knight Rises better than The Dark Knight? If you were one of those fans who prefer Batman Begins to TDK then you'll find much to love about TDKR. And if you weren't then no Batman film will ever match TDK for you.

As both Batman and Bruce Wayne, Christian Bale's work here is master- class, and he gives the character such an inescapable melancholy – a certain perseverance in the face of absolute resignation to his fate – that he becomes a more tragic figure than ever. That said, he's aided enormously by a never-better Michael Caine, who turns with hope and palpable love what might otherwise be expository dialogue into searing, supportive criticisms of Wayne's self-destruction.

On the other hand, after being marketed as heir to the Joker in ""The Dark Knight,"" Tom Hardy's Bane is a different sort of villain – a focused and more ideologically-developed version of Heath Ledger's Joker – but one with equally ruthless charm.

While she doesn't quite steal the show as Heath Ledger's Joker did, Hathaway's Catwoman is a magnetic presence whenever she's on screen and she has great chemistry with Bale. Selina may be the proverbial good bad girl, the thief with a heart of gold, but Hathaway imbues her with a wounded spirit and a survivor's edge that makes her feel genuine and sympathetic even when she's being naughty.

That being said, the acts of good old Gary Oldman and the power house Joseph Gordon Levitt cannot be ignored.

Christopher Nolan is in peak time of his life. Whatever he is touching is turning into gold. He has taken The Batman series to a level which no one in thousand years can reach. The action scenes, the rise and the fall of all the characters along with the climax are just the pieces of the puzzle, which in the end you feel was taking shape since the day Batman Begins released. The first hour ties all the loose ends the first two movies left behind and the climax is so apt that you leave the theater feeling contended and satisfied.

We may never see superhero films quite like these again, and that's fine. Nolan had something special to say with his time in the trenches, and he's ended on his own terms.

I wonder which series Nolan decides to reboot next!"
"Firstly I will say that I loved Batman Begins. Then Christopher Nolan gave us The Dark Knight and I felt it was on a whole other level than Batman Begins. I went into the cinema to The Dark Knight Rises on the day of release with high expectations. These were blown away! I even went to see it at the cinema again and I've never done that before! (I understand other people saw it many more times but still a first for me)

The acting was absolutely superb! Christian Bale was at his very best playing Bruce Wayne/Batman. Michael Caine was brilliant as Alfred despite his short screen time and I feel the performance was Oscar nomination worthy. Anne Hathaway was a better Catwoman than I could have imagined. Joseph Gordon Levitt was really good as Blake. Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman were good as always playing Gordon and Fox. Marion Cotillard was good as Miranda as well. Finally Tom Hardy as Bane. I thought this was good casting from the start but I never imagined something quite this good! Tom Hardy stole the show for me just like Heath Ledger did in The Dark Knight. Bane is one of my favourite baddies of all time now and while it wasn't quite as good as The Joker, it was as close as it was ever going to come. Tom Hardy is worthy of an Oscar nom for his portrayal of Bane especially since he was restricted with the mask and had to convey emotions through eyes, voice and body language. There were a few moments where I couldn't understand his voice but sometimes it just took a few extra seconds to absorb it and his voice sounds too awesome to care anyway.

Wally Pfisters cinematography was incredible once again and I think I see another Oscar nomination for him.

Hans Zimmer's score was his greatest yet in my opinion and it really added to the emotional depth of the film and just got you into the film right from the start. Dare I say it another Oscar nomination?

Finally Christopher Nolan's Direction was incredible as always and I truly believe this to be his finest creation to date and he must get an Oscar nomination if not his first win, he definitely deserves it.

Overall this film was outstanding, one of the greatest films ever made,the finest of Nolan's Batman trilogy and the best superhero movie of all time. An Oscar nomination is deserved and I think any other film coming out this year will struggle to beat it."
"Is it a perfect film? No. It is a great blockbuster? Yes, it is. Tonally, The Dark Knight Rises rises above its predecessor in the trilogy, because it manages to balance the grounded in realism and comic book aspects into a tonally coherent work. In fact, though it still attempts to ground itself in reality, this is the most operatic and most bombastic of the Batman films. And, dear lord, does operatic work with the superhero genre. After all, at its true core, Batman, and the superhero genre, is inherently a ridiculous concept. I loved the ridiculous voice of Bane and Michael Cain's constant hamming it up, crying speeches.

In recent years, the JJ Abraham's school of film-making has gained currency. The film moving so fact to one scene to the next that the audience barely has time to register the illogical steps taken by the characters. This is evident in the 2009, Star Trek film. While Nolan does this, he does it with so much more panache that it transcends the narrative, editing weaknesses associated with this modern form of film- making. The Dark Knight Rises is a pure cinematic experience. It is a film that needs It is a film that needs to be experience in the big screen. Even the hand to hand fighting sequences-- an area that Christopher Nolan has struggled with in the past -- are exemplary; they are reminiscent of the slow light saber fights in the Old Trilogy.

The biggest problem with the film is that it does not developed the relationship between Marion Colitard's character and Bruce Wayne well enough; it feels too force. Another major problem with the film is the Howard Hughes segment, it which it is they only portion of the film that drags."
"First of all, the Dark Knight Rises in the concluding and final chapter in the critically acclaimed Christopher Nolan (Director) Dark knight Trilogy, and due to it being the predecessor to 2008's The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises was already overwhelmed with especially high expectations. However did it meet those expectations?

(Spoilers!)The Dark Knight Rises opens with an overwhelming plane aerial action sequence, an the introduction of Tom Hardy's representation of the character of Bane. Tom hardy's performance as Bane is constantly stimulating, both visually and mentally, possibly as stimulating as Heath ledger's representation of the Joker in The Dark Knight, however I do believe that Hardy's performance is heavily tainted by the way in which the character of Bane was ""removed"" from the film, during the final act of the film. Among the incredible five star performances of the cast from Anne Hathaway in her fitting performance as Catwoman to the emotional performance of Morgan Freeman, the acting was a driving force in the film's outstanding quality. The intense, emotional performances were essential to the film's sharp writing, great pacing throughout the story. Christopher Nolan's incredible flashback technique used to compose an incredible plot twist during the final act of the Film. It has been constantly noted that the film has an extensive amount of plot holes, however after analyzing the story, I do believe that many of the plot holes mentioned are very pedantic methods used by fans of other blockbusters such as The Avengers, to better their personal opinions, rather than explaining what they enjoyed about their own personal favorite, they would rather slander and taint The Dark Knight Rises.

However the film does have some relevant plot holes, which could have been resolved by additional footage, such as a director's cut or a three and a half hour edition of the film, I would have also been satisfied with a two part version of the film in which each part was two hours, or more in length. The film's combination of ""the chase"",and the ""the ticking time bomb"", during the final action sequence was an incredibly powerful sequence which kept me heavily invested in the outcome of the story, which climaxed with the most emotionally gripping moment in comic book film history, in my opinion. The supposed death of the Batman in the nuclear explosion, later denied by his alive appearance as Bruce Wayne, was a symbolic way to express how the death of Batman, allowed Bruce Wayne to Truly ""live"", while also leaving you wondering how he did it? Bruce Wayne's time in the underground prison was incredibly reminiscent of Batman Begins, as Bruce Wayne was forced re build his broken psyche, and truly become the Batman, physically and mentally; this also defined Bane to be both the greatest test for Batman mentally and physically but also the most important factor in Bruce becoming a truly righteous hero that Gotham deserves. And the final gift from Christopher Nolan the audience, was Joseph Gordon Levitt becoming the symbol of hope for Gotham as Wayne did in Batman Begins, leaving the audience understanding that the Batman is immortal in a metaphorical way, anyone with the will to do so can be Batman, in Nolan's cleverly and emotionally investing world. The Dark Knight Rises was a satisfying ending chapter to a greatly weaved masterpiece of a trilogy from start to finish. I would give The Dark Knight Rises 9.5/10, or an A+."
"I loved the Dark Knight. I loved its complexities, I loved its performances and I loved its direction. It was not only a great superhero film but a great film in general. Did they exactly need a conclusion to Batman's story? That's really not for me to decide, but they did it and in my opinion it ended in the best possible way. Not the best way, but the best possible way. This is an excellent film, it is excellent because it demonstrates everything that made the Dark Knight Trilogy complex, and because of Nolan's direction it made it even better. Christian Bale gives a fine performance as Batman, the theatrical voice is still there, but it's toned down. I could barely recognize Tom Hardy as Bane, the voice is a little much but he still does good nevertheless. I really don't get all the hate for Anne Hathaway, she's a good actress, regardless of what her ambitions might be, she did good in Les Miz but did well here. Joseph Gordon- Levitt did good as usual, and Gary Oldman Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman can do this in their sleep. The Dark Knight was what it was because it had a realism to it, this could definitely happen in real life, in regards to the Joker. The realism fades when Bane comes along but that's not a bad thing if the story is told well (and it is). If you've seen the Dark Knight, go see this, and if you're looking for a great movie go see this."
"When I saw the dark knight rises, I expected a villain who would be able to stand up to the acting which Heath Ledger had given in the dark knight. But I was disappointed with Bane's character even though Tom Hardy tried his best it didn't have the charm which the other two villains in the prequels had... Marion Cotillard didn't do what deserved of her role.. Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine had no new form or structure even after 8 years, people change with time.. and u need to show at least some change in their character.... The only people who showed justice to their roles were Anne Hathaway as catwomen and Christian Bale.... The story was nothing exceptional. But I say to the people don't expect anything like the The Dark Knight... Just an ordinary story, with an ordinary villain with no character devlopment like the Joker or Ra al gul... And a batman who can and at no point feels weaker in courage than then villain... Overall I give it a 6 for just Anne Hathaway and Christian Bale's performance with the direction of Nolan."
"""You are in for a show tonight!"" The dark knight rises one last time to save Gotham. This movie portrays batman at his most fragile self. Problems are everywhere while solutions in the abyss. Bruce is down with grief, Wayne empire is at all time low, Bane and his gang is taking over the city brick by brick. Bruce is faced with a choice to let Gotham die or rise to give some hope to its citizens who are interested in only one thing that they do best when threatened: own survival.

This movie is a perfect blend of, pain, struggle, sadness, suspense, action, loss, chaos, triumph, powerful lines, a number of great performances and above all a very good story.

Out of so many good ones if I need to choose a single stand out performance it would be Christian Bale, he has come a long way. This movie gave him a real chance to show what he is capable of as Bruce Wayne. Then comes Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, reviewing their performance would be like holding a candle to the sun so I won't. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ann Hathaway were perfect for their parts, I was a little doubtful of Hathaway but she managed to steal the frames a good number of times. While I missed a mind blowing performance like Heath, Tom Hardy as Bane managed to deliver a handful of terrifying moments and last but not the least what a great music.

A tiny issue I had was that first half took a little while to come to speed, but I guess it was necessary to build the story and to tie up the loose ends from last two parts.

No amount of words would be enough to praise Christopher Nolan for giving us a stellar finale.

My Rating: 9/10"
"I don't normally review movies unless I feel compelled to do so. In this case, I feel I was duped into expecting a very good movie. Isn't that what I should have expected with an 8.5/10 rating?

I won't get into the details, they're well-documented throughout these reviews. And I won't detail the nonsense that is considered a plot for those that may not have had the displeasure of viewing this movie. There are so many times that I was left shaking my head that I sustained a neck injury just watching this.

I like the idea of Bane as a physically powerful foe, I like Anne Hathaway as Catwoman (although her character has serious flaws) and the veterans do their normal commendable job attempting to bring stability to this disaster.

I gave it a 3 because I like Batman and I still want to like him. I will put this movie out of my mind so that I continue to like him."
"The plot is a total nonsense from the beginning to the end. They don't even try to make it believable. I know it's a super hero movie, we're not in the real world, but still. I felt this movie was an insult to the public. It's like saying you don't understand anything of what is happening in the world around you, why would you care to understand what is going on in the movie? We end up with a very childish plot where whatever you want to happen just happens with magic. A nuclear reactor turned into a nuclear bomb with a screwdriver in 2 minutes in a garage, a broken spine healed with a rope and 3 push ups, it's all like this. Just boring and lazy. Even the fights are lame. Bane and Batman are supposed to be the 2 best fighters in the world but they fight like a couple of drunk cowboys. Jackie Chan would kick their butt in no time. Can't believe it's rated 8.7 today."
"I wanted to write ""just see it,"" but IMDb requires 10 lines, so here goes nothing. There's something in this film for everyone, especially Batman fans. That doesn't mean Chris Nolan and team tried to please everyone -- if you've seen any of his films, you know he's got too much integrity and cinematic love for that. There's romance, real drama and feeling, in contrast to the first two movies. Action fans will dig it, wingnut tech-heads will dig it. There's even a hint of the supernatural in this movie. War movie fans will dig it. I think it's fair to say that most Chris Nolan fans will dig it too. I can't even fault the film for it's moment of garbled dialogue, because those moment just fuel my desire to see this movie again. Just see it."
"Nolan has created a Pulp Masterpiece. With Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, Nolan set out to get Batman back to his gritty roots. With Rises, Nolan slowly backs out of the grittiness and enters a pulpier realm. A Bondian realm that begins with a mid-air high-jacking. Has a villain that wears a mask 99% of the film. Batman and Catwoman fighting side by side only to be stopped by gunfire from henchmen so incompetent they can only hit their own comrades rather than hitting their intended targets. And of course a nuclear bomb countdown. Nolan clearly has a love for James Bond films (as he also showed with Inception). As a fellow Bond aficionado, I really appreciate this, and it only adds to my overall enjoyment of the film. Superhero movies generally follow a particular formula. I could predict the plot beats of most of the recent Marvel films (this is not a complaint of Marvel's Cinematic Universe, just an observation). The point is that this film (as its predecessor did) threw me more surprises than most films of this genre typically do. And my expectations were blown away. TDKR has a very intricate structure, and for being 165 minutes long, the movie flies by at a nice pace.

Nolan's film has the feeling of a Coppola-sized epic from the 1970s, with its plot complexity, large cast of characters, intricate dialogue scenes with equal helpings of pain and tragedy. Many scenes in the film are shot in an orange/sepia tone that reminds me of The Godfather Part II. Tom Hardy's Bane is a mythical, Kurtz-like antagonist. The film has subtext and some political satire, one can interpret that how they will.

""The Dark Knight Rises"" could very well be the most polarizing film of Nolan's career thus far, hopefully the debate will continue."
"Wow this brilliant way of ending the trilogy makes me feel that this is just the beginning. I would call the same casting on and on for more adventure.

Bane is not my favorite character by far (really not interesting, just a tough guy) but all participate intensely and have a role and feed the story. The casting is incredible: Batman Begins + Inception + Anne Hathaway (she's such a complete and lovable actress and person)

I just got the 2 DVD collector edition in Switzerland yesterday. I definitely recommend watching the bonus features, they explain a lot about the concept behind this movie and the connection with the beginning of the story.

An amazing production, screenplay, performance !

And yet: The whole experience was so different than on big screen. ""Duh"" you might say and still... let me explain myself:

I recognized that some parts are only effective if you watched the film only once. This doesn't necessarily happen with other masterpieces I can watch on an on.

When I watched all the interesting bonus features on the second DVD, I started noticing that from many multiple shots (shots filmed from many angles at the same time) the choice of those shots used for the movie weren't the clearest, or the most astonishing. So may things are finally not so clearly seen in the movie. There were many other successful angles that could have been used more effectively.

Music soundtrack ? Hans Zimmer did a nice job but I would have preferred James Newton Howard.

The fights weren't that clever, too tough and bulky, not necessary, no intelligence around them, plain fist. Not my port of call.

Thank you Christopher Nolan for being clever enough to participate in the cinema industry and still deliver ART.

Definitely a realistic, surprising and enjoyable film

Thanks to all reviews and commentaries.

A.real"
"THE BEST.

THE GREATEST.

THE ULTIMATE EXPERIENCE.

THE DEFINITION OF AN ENTIRE GENERATION.

Every once in a while, there's that one trilogy that would change the landscape of the film industry forever and would define an entire generation.

There was George Lucas' Star Wars trilogy, which took sci-fi movies to a whole new level (I wasn't born that time but I'm aware of the legacy of course).

Then decades later, it was Peter Jackson's Lord Of The Rings trilogy which raised the bar in fantasy epics so high that even now could never be reached much less equaled (yes, Harry Potter and Game Of Thrones are baby stuff compared to the grandeur LOTR).

And now, Christoper Nolan's The Dark Knight trilogy.

Before, comicbook / superhero movies were too campy, too light-hearted and in every bit sense of the word, unrealistic. Characters were over the top, stories were cliché and predictable, no risk factors and just dull and there's no ""holy **** did you see that?!"" stuff. It's as if they weren't serious efforts, like, studio guys would just say ""hey since everybody's doing it, let's do it!"". Results vary but mostly mediocre stuff and below. Simply, you don't get emotionally-attached to them, which is THE POINT of watching movies.

Enter the Nolan-era of comicbook / superhero movies.

Quite literally, Nolan turned the genre upside-down, flip it and then some. Nolan CHANGED THE GAME and took it to uncharted levels by introducing never before seen elements such as dark tones and themes, gripping plots and scripts, masterclass musical scores, relatable characters which comprises of genuine heroes and likable villains, above all, pulse-pounding moments that would make your jaw drop countless times and say ""HOLY ****! HOLY ****! HOLY ****!!!"". It's a genuine effort and love of the craft that you can see and feel as much as Lucas to Star Wars and Jackson to LOTR.

It started with Batman Begins almost 7 years ago in 2005, continued 3 years later with The Dark Knight and now finally capped off with the monumental conclusion The Dark Knight Rises in 2012 as the motion picture event of the year. The trilogy redefined Batman and Bruce Wayne and everything we know in Gotham City. Right off Batman Begins' origin story, to the emotional torture core of The Dark Knight and to pain, suffering and triumph of The Dark Knight Rises, the legend of The Caped Crusader was flawless and the acting of the cast was impeccable all throughout.

Of course, the guy that's got to be Batman has got to really be THE GUY, and Christian Bale not only meet expectations, he exceeded them in every step of the way.

Bale is the perfect Batman, just was the late great Christopher Reeve was as Superman. I mean, nobody could replicate that connection from Reeve and Superman for decades, maybe ever (though DC and Warner Bros. would try again with Henry Cavill in Man Of Steel, we'll see). Same thing can be said to Spider-Man's Tobey Maguire, that Facebook guy is awful compared to him. As well as Robert Downey Jr. in Iron Man. And I believe the case is the same for Bale; it's gonna be LONG, LONG TIME until somebody could match, much less surpass him as Batman. Most likely, never. In a nutshell, we felt for Batman because of Bale.

And same thing could be said with Nolan's Batrilogy. Right from the opening scenes of Begins and as the credits roll of TDKR, it was a ride like no other comicbook / superhero movie has done ever before. This is the kind of stuff we'd tell our children and grandchildren that defined our generation, that we'll make them watch these things years from now and tell them experiences waiting in line outside theaters and watching DVDs and Blu-rays at midnight, like our parents now do. I mean, I'm not even a comics guy (I don't read any paper stuff honestly), nor a Batman fan or fan of any comicbook or superhero, but when Nolan's trilogy came, I became one. That to me, is something EXTRAORDINARY very few in one's life could experience.

Obviously, Star Wars has it fair share of haters, so does LOTR, so why should we be surprised by the Nolan haters. These guys would scream ""oh that's boring I've seen that before!"" or ""that's predictable I knew it!"" or ""Avengers is the best STFU GTFO LOL LMAO!"" or whatever these guys could come up it. They're clueless anyway. Smart viewers know what's really up.

REMEMBER: These kind of critics are those who failed at art and literature and just about anything and everything in life. And when you're at the top, there'll always be those who'd want to pull you down. Nolan and his Batman is at top, that's why.

Huge props and thanks to Nolan and Bale, to Liam Neeson, to the late great Heath Ledger (I'd almost forget to say that his portrayal of The Joker is in the league of Darth Vader as the greatest villains ever), to Tom Hardy, to Michael Caine, to Gary Oldman, to Morgan Freeman and just about every actor and crew that participated in bringing Batman to life LIKE NO OTHER.

Take a bow ladies and gentlemen."
"Christopher Nolan's ambitious Batman trilogy has come to a close with perhaps one of the greatest superhero films ever made. Both Batman Begins and the Dark Knight were cinematic masterpieces and are complimented nicely with this film, The Dark Knight Rises. Being the longest film in the series, it has incredible set pieces, a sinister villain, excellent acting, a loud and bombastic score by Hans Zimmer, and lots of emotional depth.

Nolan's film takes place eight years after the events of the Dark Knight and Bruce Wayne has moved into seclusion. Regarding Gotham, crime has been suppressed with the Dent laws, but now a new force led by the notorious Bane is threatening to take control over Gotham. So is it time for Bruce to give his cowl and cape another shot?

This film has a plethora of characters so events may be confusing at time(which it wasn't for me.) Christian Bale as always is near perfect as Batman and he adds some emotional depth to his eccentricity. Michael Caine has a bigger role here and has some of the biggest, most emotion-filled dialogue of the film. While different in stature from the Joker, Tom Hardy makes a great Bane and reminds me greatly of Hannibal. Both Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman return and are amazing. I didn't think Anne Hathaway as Catwoman would be effective, but I was proved wrong. Joseph Gordon-Levitt brings his talent as well as a few surprises to the film.

Overall, this is an amazing ending to the greatest superhero trilogy. Some of the set pieces are just amazing and incredible to watch. The football stadium, the opening sequence with the airplanes, and the takeover of the stock exchange were just a few of my favorite sequences. But nothing competes with that amazing, action-packed finale. Some people may not like the ending at all, but I think it's a fair way to end the film. It's unfortunate that the movie shooting in Colorado overshadowed this film, but I want to point out movie violence is not the cause for real-life violence and we shouldn't abandon the theaters because of this heinous act. This film is amazing and I'm pretty sad that the trilogy is over. I rate this film 10/10."
"Excellent writing, excellent acting, excellent directing, etc. The Dark Knight Rises represents Christopher Nolan at his most epic cinematic state. TDKR is more ambitious than the previous two films and takes greater risks which ultimately pay off. although not quite as immersive as The Dark Knight, TDKR is more emotionally wrenching, provides more twists and operates on a much grander scale.

Despite the large new cast, Christopher Nolan manages to breathe life into each character, even the ones so ordinary as Joseph Gorden Levitt's typical cop. He also manages to tie all events in the move to a brilliant thematic climax that will wow just about everyone.

Overall, the movie is incredible and although it doesn't quite meet the standards set by The Dark Knight, it still manages to inspire immense awe from its audience."
"'The Dark Knight Rises' isn't Epic. But its impressive nonetheless. Christopher Nolan delivers a film worth watching, however, he doesn't quiet top himself in here. Its an entertainer!

'The Dark Knight Rises' Synopsis: Eight years on, a new terrorist leader, Bane, overwhelms Gotham's finest, and the Dark Knight resurfaces to protect a city that has branded him an enemy.

'The Dark Knight Rises' is overtly long & dragging. Christopher Nolan & Jonathan Nolan's Screenplay is excellent in parts, but at times, it comes across as dragging & long. For example, the bad-guy, Bane, played by Tom Hardy, why does he hate Gotham so much & why he's being so god-damn heartless. There is proper reason, yet he's creating a chaos. Another flaw, lies in its running time. 168 minutes seems a bit too stretched. Christopher Nolan's Direction is extremely competent. Cinematography is grand. Editing & Art Design, are spectacular. Action-Sequences are huge.

Performance-Wise: Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman, shines. The Oscar-Winning Actor is so believable & natural in his part. Tom Hardy as Bane, is a big letdown. Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle, is quite good. Michael Caine as Alfred, is given the backseat, while Gary Oldman as James Gordon & New-Entry Joseph Gordon-Levitt as John Blake, are terrific. Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate, has a delicious role. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, is dignified.

On the whole, 'The Dark Knight Rises' is an impressive superhero flick, but it isn't half as good as its predecessor 'The Dark Knight'."
"I am a person that just do not believe in a perfect rating, but this movie definitely deserves a full credit. I mean whats not perfect in it? the acting , the music, the story , the action, everything was made in the most perfect way ever and I Like it. I saw this movie may be 3 times now and I believe it is very difficult to do such great work again.

I will never forget the first time i saw it in the movies and the theater was full and at the end of it everyone started applauding like i never saw in my entire life. If for any reason you hadn't seen this movie then you should. You will just love it."
"The Dark Knight Rises Review 3/5

The expectations were high for this film given that it was a direct follow up to The Dark Knight. With a great storyline, memorable characters, groundbreaking action scenes and a perfect performance by Heath Ledger it was easily one of the best comic book adaptations to date. But even that film had its flaws but not as much as this one. At the time of its release a lot of the critics received backlash and even death threats from the rabid fans. The fans were even worse than the Star Wars fans. Anyway The Dark Knight Rises is far from perfect but it does have some enjoyable moments throughout.

Eight years have past since the events of The Dark Knight. Bruce Wayne is retired living his life in isolation, The Joker is locked away and Gotham City's crime rate is at an all time low. But the masked villainous Bane and his army are lurking in the sewers and he has a plan. After hearing about Commissioner Gordon being hospitalised and encountering a mysterious cat burglar Bruce Wayne decides to come back out of retirement. It's a real crowd pleaser when he comes back as Batman but he has to go toe to toe with his toughest opponent yet. He's not as fast as he used to be however that is what gives the film it's edge, we can finally root for Bruce Wayne because he is in a vulnerable state here. Bane is sort of like a 60s Bond villain taking the city hostage threatening to blow it up if anyone leaves.

The opening plane hijack sequence is breathtaking and like the majority of the action sequences it was shot in IMAX using practical effects. From miniatures to daring stunts we see real stuntmen hang off of the dangling plane fuselage. The overall action scenes are intense accompanied by an epic music score by returning composer Hans Zimmer. Although some of them suffer from bad editing they are still enjoyable and look spectacular. It's best to watch it with surround sound speakers as the sound effects make the experience more immersive from Banes heavy breathing, the bone crunching punch ups to the extremely loud gunshots and explosions. It's the most action packed of the trilogy but it suffers from a thin plot.

Christopher Nolan does a fine job directing the film but not much can be said about his screenplay. Unfortunately it's his worst writing yet making this the most implausible chapter. It's full of so many character storylines and it just gets confusing. There are a lot of things that make little to no sense. There isn't much logic to many of the scenes, there are some obvious twists throughout and a lot of things go by unexplained. Using flashbacks it harps back to previous plot lines and characters in an attempt to make it feel more connected to those films. On top of all that it runs at nearly 3 hours which is just too long considering how half baked the plot is.

Aside from all of this Christian Bale gives his best performance as a more weary broken Bruce Wayne. Tom Hardy is really good in the role of Bane and every time he's on screen he is physically imposing, very intimidating and he has some great lines of dialogue. Michael Caine is only in it briefly but he gives an emotional nuanced performance as family butler Alfred. Joseph Gordon Levitt and Anne Hathaway both do serviceable jobs - However with such a big cast the film didn't really need them, they are just there for fan service and to be honest their story arcs are not very interesting. But that being said Hathaways cat suit has a cool realistic look to it which fits well within the continuity of the Nolan franchise. That's one thing you can give them credit for is they make these films as grounded in reality as possible. But with outlandish characters like Bane and Catwoman there are a lot of things they have to compromise like Selina Kyle/Catwomans backstory. She wasn't resurrected by cats like the comics, she is simply just a woman who is very good at sneaking about. Bane isn't a raging hulk who gets pumped on steroid juice he's just a conflicted man who has been through some bad stuff. Overall it's a thourouly enjoyable film but it's let down by lazy writing full and plot-holes."
"This is one of my favorite bad movies ever. So many things in it don't make any sense. It's awfully written and the fact that this movie has an 8.4 shows that many people don't have a single braincell.

FBI guys in plane instead of shooting attackers outside plane decide to start punching their tied-down prisoners so the movie can happen.

Who are Bane's armed men in the first place and why do they blindly follow him?

Gotham sends the entirety of Gotham's cops (3,000 in a city of 12 million compared to New York's 40,000 cops in a city of 8 million) into the sewers instead of smaller teams of Swat troopers or national guard and now they're trapped? And can't they just climb out of the manholes or is Bane's men guarding every manhole in the city?

The cops charge Bane's men armed with machine guns and hardly any of the cops die and the next scene everyone is in a fist-fight?

Why doesn't Bane detonate the bomb immediately? Why wait 6 months? Literally no reason because he intends to just blow it up regardless.

Awful ending twist with Talia Al'Ghul that means nothing to anyone and leads to an unintentionally hilarious death scene.

Batman's broken back fixed by a rope and a punch to it.

All in all, not good."
"The Matrix, Spiderman and Pirates Of The Caribbean, all critically acclaimed and all bringing in a satisfying box office return. Their reputation inspiring movie bosses to produce sequel, which all ended up disappointing... Will The Epic 'Dark Knight' trilogy be reduced to the same fate... The world waited with baited breath.

The Dark Knight Rises, the third and final installment of Christopher Nolan's comic book saga lived up to it's name to rise above other movie trilogies and soar to the thematic and stylistic heights of its predecessors.

In the mid 1990s' the reputation of Warner Bros. Batman franchise was at an all time low with Batman & Robin producing some of the cheesiest one liners in cinema history (such as Mr Freezes ""Ice to see you!"").

In 2005 Nolan resurrected the Caped Crusader in with the critically praised 'Batman Begins'', the grittier and darker origin story of how Bruce Wayne became to be a moonlight masked vigilante standing up against injustice in the city of Gotham. Helped with solid performances from Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes and Cillian Murphy a sequel was inevitable.

In 2008, Nolan and his team returned for the follow-up. The Dark Knight, just as captivating and ingenious as the first but with one exceptional difference. Heath Ledgers Joker, stole the show (and Academy Award) as he bought Gotham City to it's knees by turning Gothams White Knight (DA Harvey Dent) on to a grief driven killing spree that destroys everything that Harvey and Batman had fought so hard to stop.

In The Dark Knight Rises, the story has progressed eight years. Batman has taken blame for Harvey Dents murders and left Gotham to fend for itself. Bruce Wayne is holed up in a rebuilt Wayne Manor and is the most adrift we've seen the character on screen, weakened and even going grey he is considering a return to action against taking a new path. Bruce and Alfred (Michael Caine) debate Batman's future in tense and tender exchanges, that will tug your heart. You're hooked, and the fighting hasn't even started.

In a scene James Bond would kill for, a CIA aircraft transporting terrorists is sensationally hijacked in midair by Bane (Tom Hardy), an intimidating hulk whose nose and mouth are encumbered by a tubular, grill-like metal mask which gives his voice an artificial quality similar to that of Darth Vader. What Bane is up to is not entirely clear, but it can't be good.

Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), A spirited Cat burglar tries to get Bruce Wayne/Batman back into the limelight. But an attempted kidnapping of Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) and a brazen attack on the Stock Exchange from Bane is what catches the Bats attention, the latter catastrophe having the double effect of bankrupting Bruce Wayne.

Commandeering the city's sewers with his fellow mercenaries, Bane begins his first onslaught on the caped crusader which will leave you gasping in disbelief. If the Theme behind Batman Begins was fear and the Dark Knight is chaos then the theme behind this movie is clear Pain! The remaining 90 minutes will keep you on the edge of your seat, the pinnacle moment when Bane destroys well everything, including a masterfully created scene that we've already seen in the trailers when Gotham's Football stadium implodes to the earthy. Depths below.

The real world threats of terrorism, political anarchy and economic instability make The Dark Knight Rises incomparable to this years other superhero blockbusters. While The Avengers may have bigger zings, The Dark Knight Rises has one thing Whedon missed: emotional engagement; a genuine sense of jeopardy and deepening human drama. (OK, three things.)"
"With this film I would say it was quite magical. The affects that took place were spectacular a great increase from The Dark Night. When I saw this film, as a Batman fan I purchased the trilogy ticket starting from the first Batman featuring Christian Bale up to the Dark Night rises.One thing I would have to add is that I feel as if Anne Hathaway didn't live up to the role of Catwoman as I expected also known as Selina. I thought that she could have used some studying from older movies or even comic books to display the attitude of Selina just a little bit more. But overall this was an exciting film and ultimately one of the best Batman movies to come in this day in age. Unfortunately I am not that ecstatic for Ben Afleck to play the new Batman coming out in theaters's in 2015."
"Not being a huge fan of superhero movies, I didn't have much expectations for Batman Begins. However viewing the 2005 Christopher Nolan production, I was pleasantly shocked. Then after my huge expectations for, ""The Dark Knight"", Christopher Nolan blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, ""The Dark Knight Rises""? Quite simply, Yes! My big expectations were once again, blown away. What a production! This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The editing, sound, score, visuals, direction and action are all top notch.

The film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Christian Bale, of course still makes is a great Batman. Michael Cain is fantastic, as he always is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be considered for an Oscar nomination. Tom Hardy as Bane is utterly terrifying, at times, and completely ominous. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman/Selina Kyle is a scene stealer. She is completely engrossing. Everyone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors are so well done, so well written, and so well directed. The Dark Knight Rises is is emotionally riveting and amazing to view.

At a running time of almost 3 hours, the film never becomes dull, which is pretty impressive. The movie's action sequences are spectacularly well created and very intense. The dialogue between the character's are intelligent and highly believable. The movie's soundtrack is terrific and really exemplify's many of the movie's scenes. Extremely well editing and sound use really develop many of the movie's action scenes, so it's not just explosions and visuals like in many other movies. Nolan creates a grand, dirty, engrossing world, and his action sequences just hum.

In conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that great writing and direction can enhance any movie-going experience, even superhero movies, which are usually thought of as mindless entertainment. I am wholly satisfied with Christopher Nolan's vision and thank all who worked on this film for bringing such an intricate interpretation of its very famous literary source. I cannot recommend this film anymore than I have, I just have to say everyone and anyone should see it. 10/10"""
"The Dark Knight trilogy tells us a lot about Nolans understanding of modern cinema, as well as his control over the Batman franchise.

It's not always obvious that Nolan is that interested in the hero genre, more with continuing the journey he started with Inception (along with much of the same cast). But the advantage of this is that the scenes with Batman and Bruce Wayne have no extra gravity to them, giving the chance for characters to develop.

To a degree.

Even approaching 3 hours, Nolan stretches his skill and that of the cast to rush through much of the plot, especially the back-stories that he isn't much interested in. This leads to the usual number of unexplained convergences, plot vacancies and narrative extended death scenes that plague most modern films. Yes, it drives the internet forums and people see the films again but this weakens cinema and strengthens the longer TV serials that attract so many film directors. Nolans exploration of identity (every character has a masked past, present or future) feels compressed here, fitted between the blowing up of the scenery.

Looking through his, er, oeuvre, it is clear that Nolans interest in perception was best met by Christopher Priest with The Prestige. I can see Nolan and Priest combining again, but I can't see him trying another full action film - his disdain for the material is starting to surface."
"This will be a very underrated movie due to the amazingness of The Dark Knight. However, in many ways it is just as groundbreaking, philosophical, profound, and good as its predecessor. It won't necessarily surpass the masterpiece that the Dark Knight is, but it really comes awfully close. It is its own thing, and other than a few sequences midway through and towards the end, it is every bit a masterpiece of action-filmmaking as The Dark Knight. The way Nolan handled the introduction, background, and development of the new characters was a treat and very satisfying. The only difference between this and the Dark Knight really is that the weaknesses of The Dark Knight Rises are just more pronounced. With a few scenes edited out in the middle, it would be just as good. This movie has inspirational components to it, while The Dark Knight has more morality-oriented components to it. But they both contain bits of both."
"The third and final installment in this trilogy is much maligned because of a horrible incident around its release that had nothing to do with the film. While that tragedy is hard to separate from the film, it is unfortunate because the film is very good. The film is as dark and painful to watch as the prior two, but just as good in my opinion. The events of the two prior come together and come full circle as Christian Bale's character has to deal with his past, the events he put in place, and his place in the world. Tom Hardy is excellent as Bane. The supporting cast is terrific. This, like the prior, is an adult film. It is gritty and visceral. The action is chaotic at point but very engaging. I like this story arc. I like these characters. I think the Direction and the visuals are unmatched. While I loved Tim Burton's Batman and respect it immensely nothing compares to this trilogy. It is not just good superhero filmmaking. It is great filmmaking using the superhero story as a vehicle to explore universal themes. See this and see it again."
"What a film! Rarely does one call a superhero flick a cinematic work of art. Well this one certainly is that and much more. It isn't a run-of-the-mill popcorn, action packed, story-less offering that many superhero films are. This one goes above and beyond. It is less about the masked man and more about the man behind the mask, a broken man fighting his own demons. A dark and emotional tale of absolution and revenge, strength and sacrifice. Anne Hathaway is brilliant as Catwoman. Its no wonder she is receiving nominations for her role in this movie and in Les Miserables. Bane i think is the highlight of this movie. His speech may go down in dialogue history. You feel mesmerized and taken aback by the sheer force of this movie. It has everything from the deepest darkest emotions to powerful confrontation scenes and a breathtaking climax. I had no idea so much time had gone by, that is how gripping this film is. Though if you prefer more violence and action, then this may not be for you. Personal opinion: It is the best film of 2012. A must see as it raises the bar for not only superhero flicks but also films in general."
"I love the whole Batman series with Christian Bale. I love the fact his voice was not nearly as annoying in this film. I did not see that twist at the end coming which was a nice surprise. The only thing I didn't like was Bane's character. I think it was just because of the mask thing and not really being able to see him. The actor did a great job portraying the character despite this. This is one of those movies you can watch multiple times and pick up different clues along the way. I do wish Morgan Freeman had a bigger role in this one. Love Lucius! I would like a TV movie of Lucius and Alred having some adventures together. After seeing this one, I think it's time for a Batman marathon."
"The third and final instalment of Christopher Nolan's, Jonathon Nolan's and David S. Goyer's legendary trilogy is my least favourite, but is by no means bad. The problem I have found with 'The Dark Knight Rises' is its loss of realism. 'Batman Begins', the first instalment, was extremely realistic and somehow still faithful to the comics. That was what made the film so amazing, in my opinion. 'The Dark Knight' loses the realism and the faithfulness to a degree, but that wasn't a bad thing. The tension, story, ideas and genuinely scary villains of the second instalment made it not just better than the first instalment, but possibly better than any other superhero film ever made.

The conclusion to this nigh perfect trilogy doesn't come close to the first two, but still satisfies. The realism, possibly the best thing about this trilogy, is gone. There is more than one scene or concept where you may think ""Well that's just plain stupid!"" On realism, it could have been much better. You'll know what scenes and concepts I am speaking of when you see them. Is this film faithful to the comics? No, it's even less faithful than 'The Dark Knight', but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. It means even fans of the comics are in for big, Nolan twists. I believe that it is faithful enough for most fans to enjoy it, but much less faithful than the two previous films.

The writing of this film is much like the last two. It's very Nolan; intelligent but somewhat confusing. I think the problem with this instalment is that the writers tried too hard to make it the biggest and the best. This is part of the reason the film fails to live up to the previous two. The writing is certainly the worst of the three films, but is definitely not bad writing. It still seems dark and mysterious. I think they relied too much on shocks and scary villain scenes than on adding tension and genuinely terrifying, slow scenes. The Joker had many of these scenes in the previous film, seeming unpredictable and adding tension. Due to no more Joker, the humour is gone. This was necessary, but takes away some enjoyment for me.

The directing of this film is much like the previous two. Nolan uses the same style throughout all three instalments. The directing again takes away realism with the action not being realistic. I believe that if the age certificate was bumped up they could have made the film much more terrifying and realistic. The action in the film goes back to relying on fighting usually like in 'Batman Begins', not tension like 'The Dark Knight'. However, there are still tense scenes with Bane (Tom Hardy) that match some of the previous film's Joker scenes. The shots and action scenes are fantastically done, like the previous two, but as I have said, Tim Burton's Gothic look is more preferable to me.

The characters in this are amazing. Hardly any of them seem like their comic book selves, but this can be great, adding a fresh, unique feeling to the film. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is brilliant as Blake, who I do believe adds to the film, unlike others. I also loved the controversial twist with Blake. If it were done any other way it'd probably take away the darker side to the film. The way it was done was very unique and interesting. I loved Cillian Murphy's cameo as Scarecrow again. I always love some Cillian Murphy in a film, and his rather insane Scarecrow adds a lot, in my opinion.

Christian Bale plays a brilliant Batman/Bruce Wayne yet again. I love the dark edge to his character rough voice he uses as Batman. Tom Hardy was terrifying as Bane. He is the opposite of the Joker, thinking out a large scale plan and being calmly menacing. Very different to the comic book Bane in lots of ways, but I do enjoy different takes on characters, instead of the same thing in each remake. Anne Hathaway played an interesting Selina Kyle. She doesn't seem to be into the alter ego thing.. I don't think anyone calls her Catwoman throughout the entire film. Her settling down with Bruce Wayne doesn't appeal to me, as it isn't in character enough.

James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer did an excellent job with the music yet again. All of the tracks are unique and are great additions. The soundtrack is very different to the previous films. The first two instalments use dragged out, slow music to create tension most of the time. This film does that, but to a much lesser degree. What I loved about the series' music in the first two was the tense, slow, metallic music that suits Batman and isn't like the usual exciting, blasting music. This music, while unique, is exciting and blasting usually. It takes the tension away again, which is one of the best things about this trilogy. As a standalone soundtrack, I absolutely love this, but as a part of this trilogy I'm not too fund of it. I much prefer the tense, slow tracks.

Overall, I believe that this is a brilliant last instalment of a genius trilogy. I loved most of it. It is very different from the previous two, which is both good and bad. It felt very exciting and tense at times, and the overall story is excellent, if unrealistic. It is an amazing film, but is not close to as good as the previous two. I find it surprising that this ranks higher than Batman Begins on the Top 250 films. This finale doesn't disappoint. It is a genius conclusion for a genius trilogy. It's not as good as the other two instalments, but beating them would be an absolutely huge achievement. I expected a brilliant film to conclude the series, and that's what I got. Couldn't be happier."
"The best installment of the Batman trilogy, The Dark Knight Rises is involving, gripping, and riveting. The story is on par, as well as a great cast new to the series (Tom Hardy, Anne Hathaway, Marion Cotillard, etc.). The movie never lags, and Tom Hardy's Bane comes across as a testosterone-fueled hunk of a man who knows true pain and wants to do justice in his own twisted ways.

While some may say that the background story of Bane isn't what's in the comics, just stop. Did it fit the movie? Maybe it didn't, because I bet my ass director Christopher Nolan took that into consideration. I bet they did a screen test, and that storyline didn't work. To be honest, it's not that big of a detail and can be easily overlooked, and it didn't do any damage to the story. In fact, it made it *that* much more interesting.

HandHStudios Rating: 10/10"
"Only Christopher Nolan, maybe alongside with the uniqueness of James Cameron and Peter Jackson's ""LOTR"" .. was able to push his own limits to deliver a better film every time .. I mean ..Batman Begins was a staggering reboot for the Batman Franchise.. The Dark Knight was simply a masterpiece ..in between there was Inception.. an incredible cinematic vision.. ! But this , The Dark Knight Rises.. is ABSOLUTE GENIUS ! Easily a once in a lifetime experience if u watch that in IMAX I mean ,people.. a 2:45 minutes movie that would keep you glued to your seat the entire time without a moment of boredom ..the entire time blown away..the entire time thinking what's gonna happen next..and hits the climax with a genius ending .. i don't know ,but ..this one has Oscars written all over it..and Nolan deserves it after such an incredible effort on his timeless trilogy and a movie that will be remembered for decades to come ! Performances..Tom Hardy,awesome job "" but still ,Joker is untouchable""..Chris Bale, amazing.. Anne Hathaway , definitely a highlight in this movie..OMG! Visuals.. i can't even start! Editing.. genius ! Score.. Heart pounding with every frame,gripping ! Directing.. mind blowing ! You expected to be blown away by this movie ? well .. i'm sure you will be , and beyond ! Best movie of the year ,hands down..and maybe for years to come ! There could easily be a fourth and a fifth installment..but who knows ,uptil now this trilogy is by far absolute perfection among all movie genres,if i may say ! Bravo Nolan and chapeau,for you are such an artist to look up to. And as for Batman.. well .. you'll always be my favorite superhero. Cheers everyone ."
"Nolan has got us accustomed to a very high standard of film making, no matter what he tackles as the subject. The Dark Knight trilogy is a very good example of this, when your typical superhero films can also stand as powerful pieces of cinema. Alas ""Dark Knight Rises"", after the exploding success of the brilliantly captured ""Dark Knight"", did fell short in comparison. Arguably, the success of any Batman film and even comic/graphic novel is dynamics between our dark hero and the villain, and in my opinion, Batman vs Bane was not taken to it's full potential. The tactical brilliance of Bane, portrayed by Hardy, was always out-shadowed by his brutality and sheer raw power, with a very dubious choice of voice effects that subtracted the terrifying factor right out of the equation, while Bale's performance was never stellar throughout the trilogy, this script did nothing to develop his character, mostly the opposite happened when you reach the end of this story. The big revelation concerning our villain only made the whole concept of Bane even less powerful, shedding some light into some questionable plot holes in the story, and there is an unwelcome sort of cheesy in all Joseph Gordon-Levitt scenes, unquestionably brought to light in the last minutes of the film. All in all, the film does feel like an ending, further deconstructing the myth of Batman, a vigilante created by a common crime by a faceless criminal, to fight so that someone wouldn't suffer through the same."
"There are not enough words to describe the magnitude of this film, let alone space to even attempt it. So I'll do my best with what I have.

This film is perfect in every way. The synergy of elements, both technical, dramatic, and those supplied by the audience (such as emotional investment in the series, etc.) make it perfect. Writer/Director Chris Nolan understood how invested the audiences were in this series and he hit every single note perfectly.

The picture unfolds like a beautiful nightmare. We ease back into the world of Gotham well enough that we recognize the world we left briefly from the Dark Knight. Instantly we feel that the stakes are higher, and as the film goes on, the stakes are raised even further, seemingly impossibly so. Then, finally, as the picture hits its stride, we find ourselves engrossed in a spectacle the likes of which have not been approached since Lord of the Rings.

The depth of story and character, like so many of Nolan's films, are what bring all the elements to a head. Bane is maniacle, calculating, determined, and above all, undeniably and irrevocably brutally violent. This violence takes all forms, and manifests itself into some of the most brilliantly awe-inspiring action sequences you will EVER see.

Dark Knight Rises gets better with every passing second, between the action, the intrigue, the drama, and the mystery, the final result is nothing short of stunning. And while this may be an opinionated review, I beg every person alive to experience what this film has to offer.

I swear on my life this movie is pure perfection."
"Christopher Nolan has finished up the Batman series in remarkable style. Where Batman Begins was about conquering fears and the Dark Knight was about traversing the fine line between order and madness; the Dark Knight Rises seems to be a movie about compromise and acceptance.

It has been eight years since the death of Harvey Dent and Gotham has settled down into some semblance of peace. The main instigators of this crime-free age, however, have many scars for their trouble. Bruce Wayne ( Christian Bale ) is a reclusive cripple- with shot knees and scar tissue riddling his body. Commissioner Gordon ( Gary Oldman ) has found his career is now burdened by the lie that he and Batman wove to keep Harvey Dent's reputation spotless- so much so that he is separated from his family. Alfred ( Michael Caine ) despairs about Bruce Wayne's welfare- fearing that his master wants little more than a grand death. And Lucius Fox ( Morgan Freeman ) is attempting to stave Wayne Enterprises from bankruptcy thanks to all the money that Wayne has invested into Miranda Tate's ( newcomer Marion Cotillard ) renewable energy source.

However a new threat emerges in the guise of Bane ( Tom Hardy )- a massive masked mercenary who has a connection to Batman's past. He claims to want a new Gotham where the 'have-nots' can rule over the 'haves' and bring true justice to the rich and corrupt. Alongside him is Selina Kyle ( Anne Hathaway ) a cat burglar who motives are enigmatic at best. It is therefore up to the old guard as well as idealistic cop John Blake ( Joseph Gordon-Levitt ) to try and hold Gotham together.

Nolan has gone for bigger is better in his third movie of the trilogy and it certainly comes off as an sweeping, epic movie. Christian Bale probably gives his best performance as Bruce Wayne and Batman and the scenes he has with Caine's Alfred are particularly moving. Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman are both very good also- with the scenes between Oldman and Gordon-Levitt ( probably the best of the newcomers ) nice to watch.

But as good as the film is...it doesn't really seem to cover much more new ground. This isn't really helped by their choice of villain. Hardy does a good job as Bane, but he isn't helped by his breathing mask which makes him, at times, hard to understand. Furthermore, while Bane is shown to be dangerous, Nolan seems to be forcing the viewer to show how dangerous he is. Without the personal and affable menace of Neeson's Ra's Al Ghul or the twisted and frightening charisma of Ledger's Joker, Bane's most menacing moments come before the real action kicks off. Furthermore, it's difficult to see why anyone would want to follow him- utopia or not.

As for Catwoman, Hathaway is very good in the role, but her character seems to be frustrating at times- seeming to just sit on the fence for the heck of it. Cotilliard's Miranda Tate is a fairly bland character that doesn't add much to the proceedings either.

Furthermore, while the movie is indeed epic in scope, it sometimes gets lost in its own arcs in a way that the Dark Knight never did. The twists and turns that would have been seen as remarkable in the Dark Knight in this movie came across as almost unnecessary.

Begins was a tight film that revolved around a single plot arc and holds together well. The Dark Knight was the true noir epic- a sweeping tale about morality and order in a insane city. The Dark Knight Rises is a flawed masterpiece- it's achievements not quite living up to the ambitions that it perhaps had. However, any Batman movie directed by Christopher Nolan is probably a good one. This is no exception."
"Nolan nailed it on the head with this one. Banes awesome voice and tyrant role makes this movie flat out the most epic of the trilogy. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, and as mentioned in previously read reviews, Bane on screen really gets your blood pumping. The late Joker had a great plan for corruption, but Bane's plan is simply to rule - and he plays the part perfect. There will certainly be comparisons of the two, but their characters are so entirely different, there is no comparison. Nolan also nails it again with these surprise character roles in Hathaway and Hardy - Bane is by far the most epic villain the Bat has ever seen and Hathaway is surprisingly a sexy and bad ass Catwoman. I am just so bummed this series is over, and very bummed that Nolan's next work is Superman...

Hopeful Robin spin off anyone????"
"Will this add to TDK's legend? Sure, TDK was good but grew to be THE most overrated film of any genre because of the Ledger and Nolan fanboy InterLove. Now, TDKR delivers one of the most unmemorable and downright disappointing sequels ever put to film. Yes, it ranks right down there with Crystal Skull in terms of huge and head scratching let downs.

TDK was fine entertainment that may have gotten over-inflated and over-praised with the passage of time. Don't get me started about Batman Begins. The fact is that TDKR is another Batman Begins without the intrigue. Frankly, that makes Nolan's Batman trilogy a dull sandwich when you think about it. TDK is the meat and the first and now especially the third films are nothing but gummy Wonder Bread equivalents. I can't believe how shallow TDKR turned out despite them trying to jam everything in to the film. Unlike TDK, word of mouth will hurt TDKR because this mangled and often dumb film is a mess. A genuinely un-fun mess at that.

I know certain Nolan fanboys everywhere are circling the wagons to praise this movie but that in and of itself proves what I'm saying. Fanboys wanted to like it and apparently will look past all of its flaws. Everyone else is saying it's written like a shallow popcorn flick but with dull action sequences. There really is nothing special on display here and it's so much LESS than the second effort. How can a film follow something somewhat good with something this bad? It's not just the high expectations. It really is a bad film all on its own.

Yet, thanks to good trailers and a general fondness for TDK, this thing will take in big money early but leave a majority of the audience disappointed to say the least. If the viewer has at least half a brain, it's guaranteed that the actual movie is going to lead to general disappointment especially if you're not already a fan.

Overcrowded and cheesy fluff usually fizzles at the box office but TDKR is bulletproof at this point. The real judge of this movie will be general reaction and most are going to correctly label it a disappointment of epic proportions."
"I did not like how this was the most sentimental of the three Nolan Batman-movies. I prefer when the emotional aspects are more subtle, letting the audience draw its own conclusions about the characters feeling given their circumstances and back-stories. In The Dark Knight I felt the director trusted his audience more to understand Wayne's reactions after having heavily emphasized his childhood in Batman Begins. Whereas in The Dark Knight Rises it was much dwelled upon and fed to us with sentimental music. This made the first part of the movie a bit dreary, but it quickly became more enthralling and kept getting better as the story progressed. The acting was impeccable as were the visuals. I admit to having prejudices against superhero-movies, but the characters are complex and interesting. So was the plot, though it is clearly made to appeal to a mass-audience. There is nothing wrong with being popular and I did not waste my time watching these three movies."
"The Dark Knight Rises ends the Christopher Nolan trilogy based on the DC Comic superhero. Set eight years after the end of The Dark Knight, Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, Michael Cane, and Gary Oldman are back to fight the crime in Gotham City. This time, though, Batman faces one of his toughest opponents yet: Bane(played by Tom Hardy). Joining him are the unpredictable Catwoman(Anne Hathaway), and the young but passionate policeman John Blake( Joseph Gordan-Levitt).

As expected, Christian Bale gives an excellent portrayal of Batman, although this time he is allowed more time to build on Bruce Wayne. Morgan Freeman and Michael Cane bring their best once again, as they seem to always do in their films. Personally, I was a little weary of Anne Hathaway's performance of Catwoman. I've seen many of her films and generally enjoy her work. However, I was unsure if she could pull off Catwoman/Selina Kyle. Well, I was wrong. Hathaway was spectacular and shined in every moment on screen. I could say the same thing about Joseph Gordan-Levitt's performance, too. Sometimes the greatest asset to an actor is his or her ability to control every facial expression. Gordan-Levitt has perfected it, and proved it in his performance in TDKR.

There are only two negative notes to make about this film, as great as it is: the first being that it felt long. Yes, the film is nearly three hours long. And despite the fact that boredom never set in, I still felt the effects of a three-hour movie. At the same time, I didn't mind because there were several new characters who needed introducing and building, so it worked out for the better than the worst. The second, Bane's voice was a bit too raspy for my taste. There were a few moments where I had a difficult time understanding what he was saying. If they would have cleared his voice up just a wee bit more, it would have been perfect.

Overall, the film was fantastic, and was definitely what I was expecting, especially coming from a beautiful cast and superb director. Also, I can't help but mention the perfection that comes from Hans Zimmer. His film scores are sometimes the only reason I'll watch a movie(although not in this case lol)! The Dark Knight Rises was the best ending to this excellent trilogy. Now I'm looking forward to the next big project of Christopher Nolan!"
"The Dark Knight Rises fails to capture the magic of its predecessors. While it was understandable to suspend disbelief for the Joker's antic because of his volatility, the same doesn't hold true for a cold and calculated Bane. This time the nihilistic philosophical lessons come off as pretentious and worn out. Even the repeated formula of action sequences pale in comparison to the first two films. What's left is a hastily done wrap-up of a film with zero character development for the supporting cast and a shallow narrative painted over a faux black."
"I'm writing this for one purpose and one purpose only. I know it's fashionable to hammer Anne Hathaway for her portrayal. But what do people expect from her exactly? Do they want her to puRRR constantly? Do they really expect her to camp it up? That would run contrary to Christopher Nolan's vision. No, she played it to the level of Nolan's vision. She's not camping it up. She's not playing it big. She injects fragility into the character that is very much in keeping with this iteration of Batman. She injects much needed humanity into this character.

As for the movie, I have the same problem as the other 2. Too much explaining. That's why Heath Ledger's Joker is still the best. He did things just because he's crazy. No more explanation needed."
"The story , screenplay were really good. Worth watching. Non stop Action. If you compare it with the MARVEL - ""The Avengers"", then the ""The Dark Knight Rises"" would be a tough competition to beat. I personally wish that the series just goes on.

The film featured excellent performances, by all the cast. Christian Bale, as always is great as Batman. Anne Hathaway was completely engrossing, she became ""Catwoman"", just like Michele Pfeiffer did, although their interpretations were very different, both were equally effective. Tom Hardy was the main villain ""Bane"" completely shattered my expectations.

On the whole""The Dark Knight Rises"" certainly rises a fire for money in the Box Office."
"The Dark Knight has risen! The storm came, roared thunderously and blew everything away! Watching the film evokes the same kind of ecstasy as that of making love. It starts with an extended foreplay, builds up slowly, escalates wildly and culminates into an explosive, intense and unrelenting orgasm. In fact, it's a thousand times better than an orgasm. It's as close as having that romanticized elevated sense of being numb close on the heels of death. When you go numb and your senses fail you, and you are transported into a world that is beautiful, heart-wrenching, dark, compelling, unreal and majestic - you know that the storm has hit you, the fire that rose has engulfed you.

The best part of Nolan's Batman trilogy is that all the 3 films are distinctly different from each other. It would be unfair to compare The Dark Knight Rises with the previous two installments. Batman Begins was a Renaissance-moment, a triumphant interpretation of the caped crusader. His damaged psyche torn apart by guilt and fear - Nolan nails it with precision. And, the original treatment was so refreshing when Rachel points out that Bruce Wayne was the mask that Batman wore, not the other way round. The Dark Knight was edgier, darker, representing a world where chaos and order co-exist and complete each other; the sadistic sinisternerness of the Joker, blurring the boundaries between being amoral and being diabolical, is evidently portrayed - ""What am I without you? To them, you are just a freak, like me. You complete me."" It dealt more with the psychological, a duel between the Agent of Chaos and the Fallen Knight, whereas The Dark Knight Rises is much more physical. Nolan wanted it to be a spectacle, an extravagant and dazzling finale on epic proportions, and he did achieve it. It's no-holds-barred, outrageous and heart-pounding, gut-wrenching, raw action on one hand and on the other, it captures Batman's emotional vulnerabilities like never before. For the self-appointed critics - please stop comparing. Applaud and acknowledge the genius of Christoper Nolan."
"This review is from one of the biggest Batman fans in the world so I have my own special connection with this film and what it all represents but this doesn't mean that people who are not a particular Batman fan will not like this film (even people who love the Avengers will love this film... Probably more.)

Now, the actors & actresses in this film: -Christian Bale (Just wow) -Michael Caine (you may shed a tear in your eyes because of his performance) -Morgan Freeman (Always amazing.) -Tom Hardy (who was brutal as hell. Just fantastic) -Anne Hathaway (who destroyed Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman) -Marion Cotillard (Really, really good) -Gary Oldman (has officially made another iconic character in his long and amazing career)

So, it's safe to say that all the actors & actresses in this film are beyond fantastic.

This film is the best conclusion in the trilogy I have ever seen. The action scenes are fantastically directed and beautifully executed and the writing is beyond fantastic.

Christopher Nolan really smashed it and it is one of his best films he has ever made in his impeccable track record.

This is one of the best films of the year (not because I am a huge batman fan) but because it has a fantastic storyline and amazing action scenes.

I just love this film and yes. It is joint first with the best superhero films of all time and is just one of the best action films of all time."
"Christopher Nolan has delivered a jaw dropping assault on the senses. From the incredibly choreographed fight scenes to the nuanced subtle moments that should have won an Oscar.

From moment one, right at the very beginning of Batman Begins; Nolan has told a story that is very relatable. He made Batman a story that was believable. A story that if you saw it in the newspaper, you'd almost believe it.

This film delivers the best comic book adaption I've ever seen. The ability to draw from the source material, and make it your own whilst simultaneously staying true to the material is a token to how good a story teller this director is.

Not only did the team behind these movies deliver jaw dropping moments, one after the other, but they also helped to build the foundations of the superhero world we know and love today.

If I could give this film a 11 star rating I would. It lives up to be one of the best films I've ever seen."
"""The Dark Knight Rises"" It's not so much a story about The Batman, as much as a story about Gotham City and the people affected by Bruce Wayne's alter ego. It's a culmination of every action taken by The Batman coming down in the form of some menacing villains. It's the most anticipated movie of 2012 and because the bar has been raised so ridiculously high, it doesn't quite live up to the expectations. That doesn't mean that is a bad movie. DKR has excellent performances, a tense story that will keep you on the edge of your seat, cool additions to the Batman mythology and a compelling villain. The climax is one intense experience and what Tom Hardy does with just his eyes and his voice is unbelievable. He is a truly frightening foe for The Batman. Some of the criticisms I have concern the pacing of the film. I felt like at times it runs slightly too long and some of the slow beginning should have been cut a bit. Once the momentum gets going you won't want to miss a single second. It's a satisfying conclusion to the Christopher Nolan trilogy and aside from a few minor things it's pretty much the perfect third film in one of the best trilogies out there. (Theatrical version in Imax, August 29, 2012)"
"a splendid film. for the performance of each actor - Tom Hardy does an admirable work - , for Chistopher Nolan precision of each level of film, for sound and choreography and for its strange end. because it is not exactly last part of a series but top of a lot of expectations. and this fact makes difference. because it is a form of art who represents more than story of a super hero or one of high performances of Christian Bale but a magnificent puzzle , result of refined - wise science of well- crafted. the big problem can be the end, ideal for many other films, not inspired in this case. but the end is only a window. or a state of wind after tension, action and brilliant show. a trilogy who must see it ! not because it remains the best adaptation of Batman story but because it has deep roots and inspired answers for many of viewers."
"The problems with this mess of a movie are endless. Mainly, it's just boring and completely unbelievable...and way too long. There's not nearly enough Batman and, when he is on screen, he mostly gets his ass kicked. Meanwhile the villains are capable of doing everything successfully. As a result, Batman just comes off as tired and lame. The movie's war scenes smack more of Iron Man than Dark Knight. The movie desperately tries to prove how bad-ass Bane is, but he's just...not. Truly, I expected a scene with Bane loading cancer surviving, crippled grandmas into a bus and blowing them up. It was that silly. All the subplots slow things down: I could care less about the backstory of the chick with the accent, Robin (gee, I didn't see that coming two hours before it happened), the corporate stuff, Alfred's blubbering. Dull, dull, dull. Lastly, the sound is amateur. Everything is pushed up front, so it's often difficult to understand dialogue. Just a disorganized mess."
"SOMETIMES TRUTH IS NOT ENOUGH AND PEOPLE MUST BE REWARDED FOR THEIR FAITH'

It's an action-packed, mind blowing trailer that inspires a viewer to cinematic elevation which causes people to feel motivated to do good and increases their altruism.

Whereas, 'Batman: The Dark Knight' plays out ""with the help of allies Lt. Jim Gordon and DA Harvey Dent, Batman has been able to keep a tight lid on crime in Gotham City. But when a vile young criminal calling himself the Joker suddenly throws the town into chaos, the caped Crusader begins to tread a fine line between heroism and vigilantism"" (ref. Google).

While there were a ton of character strengths and virtues exhibited in this film of the following: wisdom, knowledge, creativity, judgement, love of learning, perspective, courage,bravery, perseverance, honesty, zest, humanity, love, kindness, social intelligence, justice, teamwork, fairness, leadership, temperance, forgiveness, humanity, prudence, self-regulation, transcendence, appreciation of beauty & excellence, hope, gratitude, and spirituality.

Now pertaining to the art of watching film; THE THEMATIC ELEMENTS were mild that showcased violence, crime, and corruption for a PG-13-rated drama.

As it was a FICTIONAL story with DRAMATIC ELEMENTS of crime that had villains who were inspired by infamous, criminals of real life.

The VISUAL DESIGN was imaginative. The CINEMATOGRAPHY was very engaging, allowing the audience to feel and seem like they were apart of the action. The SPECIAL VISUAL EFFECTS were powerful. The EDITING was smooth and exciting at times. The COLOR was rich and in full-resolution.

The SOUND EFFECTS were creative. The MUSICAL SCORE was memorable and compelling. The DIALOGUE was strong and expressive.

Now the ACTING showed glimpses of performances that were full of conviction and confidence, as the actors believe in what they're doing. Gary Oldman as Lt. Jim Gordon, Aaron Eckhart as DA Harvey Dent, Christian Bale as Batman, and Heath Ledger as the Joker were all brilliant. These actors stayed truthful in the moment and emotionally connected, as they fully transformed into their characters; to stay true to the original comic book characters.

Nevertheless, the DIRECTOR'S STYLE of Christopher Nolan was clear and full of vision as a confrontationalist; in this style of directing, the director is in constant dialogue and debate with the cast and the production team about creative decisions and interpretations. The director seeks out and actively engages in such exchanges. Out of these exchanges, which can sometimes be risky, comes a final contested product as we can see through the select choices of shots.

Overall the 'Batman: the Dark Knight' movie was phenomenal, but one thing I didn't agree with was the portrayal of schizophrenia paranoid-type in the joker; Hollywood seemed to have beefed it up. Yet you got to love Batman's heart for people as he loved unconditionally, giving them (even his enemies) a choice, and always seemed to make the right decisions; to reward people for their faith."
"Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends the realm of superhero film to become a profound exploration of human nature and the complexities of heroism. This epic conclusion to Nolan's Batman trilogy is a tour de force of filmmaking, boasting a narrative depth, visual splendor, and emotional resonance that is truly unparalleled.

The film masterfully weaves together themes of rebirth, redemption, and the fragility of hope, creating a tapestry of human experience that is both intimate and universal. Christian Bale delivers a tour-de-force performance as a Batman grappling both physical and psychological demons, while Anne Hathaway's Catwoman is a captivating and complex anti-heroine. Tom Hardy's Bane is a chillingly formidable antagonist, a force of nature that Batman and Gotham to their limits.

Nolan's meticulous attention to detail is evident in every frame, from the breathtaking cinematography to the haunting Hans Zimmer score. The action sequences are visceral and exhilarating, while the quieter moments are imbued with a raw emotional power. The Dark Knight Rises is more than just a blockbuster; it is a cinematic experience that lingers in the mind long credits roll.

It is a film that demands to be seen, and re-seen, to fully appreciate its brilliance."
"Nolan continues with the last chapter of the trilogy dedicated to the Dark Knight and closes the circle of the story. As always, he appears to be an introverted character full of internal conflicts who will find himself having to clash with everything and everyone to deal with the new threat, ""Bane"". As always, the plot is full of interesting ideas and is confirmed to be of the highest level although perhaps not reaching the peaks of the two previous stories, and hence my 9. It certainly brings to completion a saga that will remain immortal and will probably no longer be affected by any another suitor. For all those who love the genre, absolutely unmissable and ""obligatory"" for those who have viewed the two previous chapters."
"WOW, JUST WOW! Nolan has created posible one of the best trilogys of all time.

Look if im being honest this was the batman movie I was less excited to watch, it could never top the dark knigth, and the addition of catwomen just seem like a lacy addition to add something new. But oh was I thankfully wrong.

This movie explored new caracters such as bane and catwomen and they were perfectly introduce.

One of the things I most liked was how it was connected to the series roots, it had many connections with the first movie which was something I liked.

I also really like how depressing it is for batman, this movie takes the suffering more emotionaly which really made me feel bad for batman.

The villan was extrenly decent, it wasent the joker yet it was still good. The performances were nice.

9.5 out of 10 truly one of the best superheroe movie."
"What an end to the Batman trilogy. It's rare for sequels nowadays to be as good as the original but their are exceptions and the Batman trilogy was was one of em.

A solid story with great pacing and a plot that made sense and was engaging from the beginning till the end. The music composition and visuals were fantastic the best out of the trilogy. Bane's character was just awesome, Tom Hardy really did an amazing job. Lastly a brilliant job on the writing.

Overall an enjoyable movie that had a remarkable yet emotional ending Memorable: Yes. Rewatchable: Yes"
"A disappointing movie, Ben's character, despite the wonderful performance from Tom Hardy, that he was a character that was not up to par and the characters in the film made many stupid decisions"
"As time goes by and the hype dies down and the Nolanites either grow up or move on to other agendas, this film will be seen for what it really is; a bloated, stupid, preposterous and dull entry in the cinematic adventures of The Batman. If you are looking for Batman, you will be disappointed as he is scarcely in the film. The first half is particularly dull and could have easily been edited down drastically to ease some of the pain. The pacing picks up in the second half, but unfortunately, so does the absurdity in the plot. The motivation of the villains is never explained in anywhere close to a satisfactory manner and their actions defy all logic. The ending is particularly laughable and even embarrassing to watch. Nolan fans who claim that these Batman films are somehow rooted in the real world aren't really paying attention. This film is every bit as bad as the Schumaker films, worse because this takes itself seriously. THE DARK KNIGHT probably stands as the best Batman film to date despite it's own flaws. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is the worst. I'd rather watch Adam West as Batman than this mess."
Nothing more needs to be said. The trilogy just builds up to this amazing end. I had a small hope that maybe just maybe it would be a continuation with Bale and Nolan doing another one. That hope was destroyed when Affleck got the role..
"As everything this amazing human-being produced, this is an incredible movie. His batman trilogy is truly for everyone, fantasy/sci fi fans or not. You are gonna love this. Thanks Nolan and Christian Bale. to Freeman and Caine aswell."
"In a world inundated with superhero sagas, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" emerges as a triumph of complexity and depth. Director Christopher Nolan's epic conclusion to his Batman trilogy transcends the confines of the genre, elevating it to the realm of modern mythology.

Set in a Gotham City teetering on the brink of anarchy, the film explores the cost of heroism and the intricate dance between light and darkness. Christian Bale, reprising his role as the brooding vigilante, brings a raw and tormented humanity to Bruce Wayne, reminding us that beneath the mask lies a fractured soul seeking redemption.

Tom Hardy's Bane, a menacing force of chaos, proves to be a formidable adversary, and his presence looms large over every frame. His chillingly measured voice and brute strength make him a worthy counterpart to the Caped Crusader.

What truly sets ""The Dark Knight Rises"" apart is its unflinching examination of the human spirit. It delves into themes of fear, pain, sacrifice, and the indomitable will to rise in the face of adversity. The film challenges us to confront our own inner demons and question the nature of heroism.

The technical prowess on display is nothing short of breathtaking. Hans Zimmer's haunting score serves as the heartbeat of the film, and Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grandeur and grit of Gotham City with equal finesse. The practical effects, especially during the mesmerizing aerial sequences, ground the film in a visceral reality that few superhero movies achieve.

While some may find fault in the film's ambitious narrative and its occasional leaps of logic, these imperfections only add to its allure. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" refuses to spoon-feed its audience, instead demanding engagement and contemplation.

In conclusion, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a masterful conclusion to one of the most celebrated trilogies in cinematic history. It's a symphony of chaos and redemption, a testament to the enduring power of storytelling, and a reminder that heroes can rise, even in the darkest of times. This is not merely a superhero movie; it's a cinematic journey that resonates on a profound level, leaving a lasting imprint on the."
"For a while, I maintained that this was the best of the Dark Knight trilogy. Watching it for the first time in a few years, I can certainly see why. The second half is pure spectacle filmmaking at an epic scale with an extended set piece that feels expansive and alive and huge all at once. However, that first hour or so is much messier, and I think that last half of the film, largely got me to ignore some of the niggling issues that frontend the film.

The Batman has been absent from Gotham City for eight years. In that time, Gotham has seen a period of peace and prosperity it has not experienced in a very long time. In order to create that sense of calm, though, Police Commissioner Gordon pumped up the idol of Harvey Dent who had become the psychopathic villain Two-Face, murdered several people, and threatened to kill Gordon's son as the White Knight, blaming all of his crimes on Batman. Together with the Mayor and the City Council, they passed the Dent Act which allowed for aggressive anti-crime actions on the part of the police, resulting in a city without any serious organized crime at all. In this time, Bruce Wayne, Batman's alter ego, has become a recluse, having spent several post-Batman years and half of his fortune pursuing a fusion reactor before suddenly shutting it down and closing himself off from the world.

In enters Bane, a member of the League of Shadows and a former acolyte of Ra's Al Ghul, since excommunicated for his extreme methods. After the death of Ra's Al Ghul, Bane took over the League of Shadows and will continue the man's mission of burning Gotham to the ground, much like the League had done to Rome and London before it. The revolution he ignites is based heavily on the Jacobins of France during the French Revolution, which fits hand in hand with the overall movie's ties to Charles Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities. He speaks of equality, but he rules with an iron fist, establishing a Committee for Public Safety, so to speak, that summarily executes enemies of the revolution. In order to get there, though, Bane must take control of Gotham.

Now, the first half of the film is really setup for the giant spectacle that dominates the second half, and some of it is quite good and other elements end up going a bit too far. From beginning to end, I think Bane is great. He's intimidating physically and he ends up with a great plan to acquire wealth and demean Batman at the same time. Stealing his fingerprints through Catwoman/Selina Kyle to fake reckless options trading that wipes out his position in Wayne Enterprises is wonderful. The chase out of the Stock Exchange, giving Bruce Wayne his first moment as Batman in eight years, is exciting and well filmed. That it leaves Wayne so destitute that he can't pay his own power bill is...curious and a step too far. I get the point. The point is to take Wayne as low as possible both as Batman and as Wayne himself, but having his power shut off because of nonpayment roughly a day after his loses all his money feels weird at best and completely ignorant of how things work in the real world at worst.

Another very good thing that the first hour does is establish the overall thematic thrust of the film, and that's around pain. Bruce is suffering from a leg injury. That's good. He immediately gets cured well enough to fight as Batman again because of a gadget on his leg. That's...less good. And yet, the idea runs through the rest of it very well. Wayne carries the pain of his loss of Rachel Dawes, from The Dark Knight (to the point that people misinterpret his receding from the world due to that loss, but that's not the case). Gordon carries the pain of having to defend the man who tried to kill his son, while losing that son in a divorce at the same time. The city carries the scars of past trauma brought on by the Joker, but it manages to live on, just as Gordon does. And what do these people do with their pain? Well, more pain must come first.

Bane's efforts to take the city end up feeling great. He has an inside man at Wayne Enterprises, also knows that Wayne is Batman because of his connection to the League of Shadows, and he uses the greed of Daggett, a wealthy executive who wants to absorb Wayne Enterprises, to prepare his plan of cutting off the city from the rest of the world. But first, he must take out the Batman. That the ""every police officer"" gets trapped in the sewars is...less good, though. It's another step too far that didn't quite need to be taken. However, this element of the plot is where Selena Kyle is useful.

Anne Hathaway as Selena Kyle is really good. She can switch between woundedly scared and feminine to coyly vicious and feminine in an instant. She steals into Wayne Manor as a servant at a party and shows both sides to Bruce as she steals his mother's pearls and his fingerprints, setting up the plot of the film. She's a survivor with a chip on her shoulder, so she's happy to watch as Bruce loses everything as the result of her actions. However she does still have a certain sense of justice so when Bane completely takes over and Gotham descends into a hellscape reminiscent of the French Terror, she's bothered by it, but being a survivor she does little to stop or escape it.

The movie turns when Batman has his confrontation with Bane. Evoking the famous comics scenario of Bane breaking Batman's back in the Knightfall run (pretty much the only time I was reading comics, by the way), Bane breaks Batman and sends him to a prison with hope, the worst punishment he can imagine. The visual image of Bruce needing to rise from the pit in order to overcome his pain and fear is great. That it takes him so much effort and that he has to essentially return to an earlier form of himself in order to do it is even better. There's such rich imagery here.

The final confrontation between Batman, as a symbol of order, and Bane, as a symbol of chaos and fire, dominates the last half of the movie. The film leaves open some unimportant questions of how Bruce Wayne gets from India to Gotham in about three weeks, but considering the character's history of running in the underworld, including in the Far East, that seems easily filled in by the audience, and once he's there he leads an all out rebellion against the ruling Revolutionary government with an aim towards getting his hands on the nuclear bomb set to go off in twelve hours. Yeah, it's very comic booky, but it's handled with the right balance of seriousness that I think the movie sells the situation well.

And in terms of the final act, the spectacle of Batman leading an army in a war against Bane for control of Gotham and against a Jacobin Revolution is great. Batman the symbol leads those who had cowered away in fear to take to the streets, fulfilling the promise of Batman as a symbol established in the first movie (and re-explained to Blake, the cop who has figured out that Wayne is Batman in...another individual step that feels too far in the first half). The evocation of A Tale of Two Cities also helps provide the film a literary understructure that I appreciate. It's not just random bad guys butting up against a protagonist we all know from pop culture. It's a literary extension of the mythos.

I feel like this was a bit of a ramble, but I'm gonna stick with it. The Dark Knight Rises is not a perfect movie. Its first half ends up taking a few ideas too far, which undermines them slightly, but not the overall story. What ends up carrying it all, though, is Nolan's sheer command of everything outside the script. Performances are very good. The spectacle is great. The use of image and sound creates a large story that carries interesting ideas about pain and the efforts to deal with it. It's an intelligent and rousing film that could have been a bit tighter, but, by the end, I don't really care that much."
"The Dark Knight Rises is so amazing!! Arguably one of the best & most underrated CBM's of all time. Although it is slow at times, the 3rd act is superb and so intriguing. I love all the characters in this film Catwoman, Bane, Natalia and especially Blake as he is such an amazing edition to this movie. It's such an amazing end to this wonderful trilogy. This twist in this film is fantastic and works so well and if I'm gonna be honest, TDKR ending is one of my favourites in any film!! Overall The Dark Knight Rises is so good and I love it a lot."
"The Dark Knight Rises arrived in cinemas on the back of deafening hype. The astronomical expectations seemed insurmountable for even a visionary of Christopher Nolan's caliber. So does Nolan deliver? Absolutely! Bold and unflinching, Nolan's operatic style makes The Dark Knight Rises an art piece of boundless spectacle and an epic of never-seen-before scope and scale. It visually obliterates the modern blockbuster with a story of daring boldness, taking your inner child on a savage ride.

The final chapter of Nolan's trilogy kicks off exactly eight years after the end of The Dark Knight. The streets of Gotham have been cleaned up but as we soon find out, all that means is that the criminals have moved underground. Having taken the fall for the death of Harvey Dent, Bruce Wayne, the tycoon behind the cowl, now lives like a specter hobbling about the recesses of his fancy mansion while his faithful butler Alfred frets over him like a gawking mother goose. But something is stirring deep beneath Gotham's streets, and it is not long before Wayne once again finds himself staring into the heart of human darkness. When a hulking, masked psycho named Bane lays siege to his financial empire and plants a series of strategically placed explosives beneath the city, intending to cut off the isle's citizenry from the outside world, he hauls the bat-suit out of storage.

From there, the movie unfolds with the carefully measured pacing of an epic, that rare sequel that endeavors to deepen and expand upon what has come before rather than merely repackaging it. It returns us to Gotham and its denizens, taking its time, gradually showing us the lay of the land. And once the cogs start whirring and the machine starts to warm up, The Dark Knight Rises takes off like a rocket – with Hans Zimmer's propulsive score as its fuel. And when it fires on all cylinders, it enters classic territory.

The pedigree of the cast imparts automatic gravitas to the movie. Christian Bale gives us a Batman with a haunted quality, showing Wayne broken, rising, and risen in perfect succession. Gary Oldman retains his quiet dignity as Commissioner Gordon. Michael Caine's Alfred continues to class up the joint. Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle, is sexy, confident, and offers a great balance of humor. As Officer John Blake, Joseph Gordon-Levitt musters an interesting blend of earnestness and intensity. Both Marion Cotillard and Morgan Freeman execute their parts with precision. And Hardy is sensational as the diabolical antagonist Bane. He bites into his character's motivations and transcends the movie to a place that is darker and more malicious.

Nolan gives us an intellectual, heart-pounding movie that grips like a vice from minute one and never lets go, capping off the trilogy with passion and dignity and with slam-bang entertainment. The Dark Knight Rises is both the conclusion the franchise needs and the conclusion it deserves!"
"The dark knight rises is a marvelous conclusion to Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. Everything is top notch in this movie. The acting, the writing, the cinematography, the storyline, the visual effects are all perfect in this movie Just Awesome"
"Bale made Batman fearsome and intense, whoever gave the go to make Bale Batman had a good idea"
A perfect conclusion to the Christopher Bale series of The Batman movies
"The best Bruce Wayne we've ever gotten in a movie. Every scene with him and the other characters, especially Alfred, are some of the best of the trilogy. The strongest part of the movie, for me, is the prison sequence with Bruce. I get chills every time he makes the climb.... everything surrounding him is flawless in my eyes.

My main negatives that bring the score down are the eventual arcs of the villains in the movie and honestly Anne Hathaway does not work in these types of roles. Some of the plot elements feel a bit rushed and don't pack nearly as big of a punch as The Dark Knight. Bane's takeover of the city feels far less believable than the Joker's.

Despite those flaws, it's hard to end a trilogy with this good of an entry. I think, thematically, its brilliant and it's also a fantastic story for Bruce Wayne's character.

This ending is also incredible, and I get chills every time I see it. Hans Zimmer's score is legendary."
"The only thing that made me laugh harder at the theater than the ""drama"" foisted upon the audience was the subset of audience members themselves who actually took this seriously. the last batman movie i saw in theaters was 15 years ago. i did enjoy the original films. they were always usually pretty fun and entertaining and i thought maybe this would be similar. i hadnt seen the other 2 movies in this newer set all the way through before seeing this so i didn't get what exactly was going on, but all sequels usually aren't connected with the previous ones all that much, but i guess this one was. In all seriousness, I've never laughed so hard at a film that tried to take itself this seriously. the comic book feel of the other films has vanished completely and instead we are given a very bland, boring, ""average"" movie that really doesn't feel much like anything batman-related. i cant believe the rating for this movie! its utterly ridiculous. my guess is its the hype and hype alone. the movie itself is instantly forgettable and i hope whatever other movies they make go back to the old style of batmans, not this law and order rubbish. my advice is this movie is a total waste of 2 hours and if you want a real good batman movie watch the tim burton movies from the 90's. oh and the val kilmer one too:)"
"I enjoyed the movie, fun, fast paced action as we expected, but there were waaaay too unrealistic exaggerated, and even absurd scenes, in my opinion.The best example of this is when Bruce Wayne escaped from being imprisoned for a long time in a hole that was hundrets, thousands of miles away, being alone and without resources and very wounded to go back to a Gotham City who was completely CLOSED for anyone to enter and exit just in the perfect moment to be in a suit and meet Catwoman and say an 'americanish' catchphrase. This is the ugliest example, but there are more moments when very alert action stops for a kiss between selina and batman or for the villain to tell the story of their life just before killing Batman...These scenes made me facepalm hard... Overall, a fun action packed movie which makes you jump off your seat a lot of times, but fails to meet the Dark Knight expectations."
"This is more than just the conclusion to a trilogy-it's the final chapter of a hero's journey that's as personal as it is epic. From the moment the film begins, you're pulled into a Gotham that's teetering on the edge, and Bruce Wayne, weary and broken, must summon the strength to don the cape once more. Christian Bale brings a raw humanity to Bruce, making his struggle against Bane-a villain unlike any Batman has faced before-feel intensely personal. As Gotham falls into chaos, you feel the weight of every decision, every sacrifice, and every blow that Bruce takes.

What makes The Dark Knight Rises resonate so deeply is its focus on the man behind the mask. It's not just about Batman fighting to save Gotham; it's about Bruce Wayne fighting to find himself again, to reclaim his life after years of pain and loss. The film's action is breathtaking, but it's the quieter moments-the glimpses of Bruce's vulnerability, the loyalty of his allies, the hope for a better tomorrow-that truly stay with you. The ending, filled with both closure and new beginnings, leaves you feeling uplifted, reminding you that even in the darkest times, there's always a reason to rise. The Dark Knight Rises isn't just an action-packed spectacle; it's a deeply human story about redemption, resilience, and the enduring power of hope."
"The Dark Knight Rises had to be stunning and spectacular and brilliant just...because. After a very good start with Batman Begins and a truly magnificent follow-up with The Dark Knight how could Christopher Nolan go wrong? Expectations were off the charts. And those expectations were not quite met. Nolan certainly didn't get it all wrong but he surely didn't get it all right either. There's no way around it, this film is not as good as The Dark Knight. Does that mean it's a total letdown? No, not at all. It just means it is not the glorious triumph everyone expected. It's a satisfying finish to a great trilogy. People were just hoping to be able to use a better word than ""satisfying"".

So why does this film not measure up to the last one? Well there are a few reasons but one stands out above the rest. It's glaring and obvious and there was nothing Nolan could have done about it. This film misses Heath Ledger's Joker. Bane is an ominous presence. But a rather dull one. And what the heck is he saying anyway? The Joker had a manic intensity to him that this film sorely misses. Stretched out to almost three hours, clearly too long for its own good, this film desperately needed some real jolts along the way. Someone had to grab a hold of the story and shake the audience up. The Joker did that, Bane does not. Yes, Bane is frightening and foreboding and clearly very dangerous. But the personality just isn't there. There's no sense of wonder. The Joker always had you on your toes, what would he do next? Bane never intrigues you that way.

If you miss the Joker it could also be said that this film leaves you missing Batman. Christian Bale is solid as ever in the dual role of Bruce and Bat but in this film he spends very little time in that famous costume. We see an awful lot of Bruce Wayne, very little of Batman. The other familiar faces from the first two films are back. Gary Oldman and Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman doing what they do. New characters? Well, there's Anne Hathaway doing a better than expected job playing Selina Kyle, who's kinda sorta maybe but not really Catwoman. Marion Cotillard plays Miranda Tate, investor in a Wayne Enterprises energy project. This character is woefully underdeveloped which proves to be problematic. Tom Hardy does the best he can with Bane, a very challenging villain to portray. Hidden away behind a mask it's hard to infuse the character with any personality. And again, seriously, what the heck is he saying? And there's Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing young police officer John Blake who knows Bruce Wayne is Batman just...because.

The fact this nobody cop knows Batman's identity is not the only disappointing contrivance required to move the plot along. The location of Bane's lair? Convenient. The entire Gotham police force trapping themselves underground? Very, very convenient. And dumb. And let us not even delve into Bruce Wayne's remarkable healing powers. This is a story which at times really struggles for momentum. With the Joker around lack of energy was never going to be a problem in the last film. Here things really get bogged down on more than one occasion. But while the film certainly has its flaws it does ultimately manage to satisfy. The trilogy gets the big sendoff it deserves. The Dark Knight Rises doesn't reach the spectacular heights of Nolan's last Batman effort so maybe you come away a touch disappointed. But taken on its own merits this is a good film. True greatness may elude it but it is a worthy end to a terrific saga."
"A horrible, bloated, clumsy and often surprisingly amateurish mess that constantly reaches for profoundly unearned emotions and falsely pumped-up thrills.

Ann Hathaway's Catwoman is, by miles, the best thing in this overcrowded, misguided concoction (of course she's never called Catwoman, because ultimately Nolan is embarrassed to be doing a super hero movie, as virtually every creative decision he makes here proves). But like anything else that might even be a little bit interesting in this movie, her character and storyline are steamrolled with the rest of the ingredients into a flat, boring cacophony.

The music is relentlessly pounding, probably in the hopes that you wont notice how rickety and poorly crafted the story is.

Christian Bale virtually phones in his performance. He plays Batman as a mouth-breather (he actually never closes his mouth when in the cowl, making Batman look like some poor kid at summer camp with severe allergies) and he's incapable of bringing the slightest touch of character to Bruce Wayne. Where is Batman the master martial artist? The World's Greatest Detective? The unstoppable force of nature? Not here. Not in this movie.

And the amazing Tom Hardy? Completely wasted and mostly unintelligible.

The script is a train wreck. There are more plot holes and leaps of logic in this film than in the Avengers, and that movie had a Norse God fighting alongside a monster of science against giant interdimensional worms. The Avengers, by the way, was twice as fun, which was expected, but shockingly, only half as stupid as this movie.

Here, let me give you a rundown of terrible, terrible logic loops, sustained stupidity, and just flat out disregard the for audience's intelligence. SPOILERS!

1. A massive terrorist raid on the stock exchange to make a single trade that leaves Bruce Wayne Broke. Okay... what the f.u.c.k.? A. Hacking a computer system does not require proximal space violence. It's called hacking. B. You're telling me they didn't shut down the stock exchange in a crises situation? C. No one questioned a massive trade that rendered one of the wealthiest men in the world broke, when that trade was performed in the middle of a destructive high-speed chase that would have been news across the entire country, let alone the entire world?

2. Batman and Bruce Wayne are the least interesting characters to the filmmakers. Batman's time on screen is incidental and his actions boring. It is a Batman film with no interest in Batman at all.

3. The Harvey Dent tough-on-crime bill has ended crime? Have you ever seen, in your lifetime, a city go from total social meltdown to utopia where the cops have nothing to do, because of a single bill that was passed? Later, when Gordon knows Dent didn't die a hero, he doesn't tell anyone, because somehow this will make the law less effective? For all his desire to make a ""real world"" superhero film, Nolan obviously has no idea about how the real world works. Toon Town in the Roger Rabbit movie had a more realistic governing set of laws.

4. Bruce Wayne is in prison forever and we hear the same damn story told over and over and over again, and it's all gender neutral so they can have one last tedious reveal at the end.

5. ""Your spinal vertebrae is sticking out of your back, here let me just punch it in! GHA! There much better. Only a matter of time before you're batman again.""

6. I once saw an episode of Vice Travel where some journalist bought a dirty bomb in Chechnya for a handful of cash. Yeah. But Bane doesn't like doing things the easy way. God forbid he just buy a bomb from a corrupt ex-soviet general. No, instead he elaborately fakes the death of a scientist (apparently the only nuclear physicist in the world, by the way), waits for Wayne to build a fusion generator beneath Gotham so he can then steal its core and use it as an atomic bomb to hold ALL OF GOTHAM hostage. Then kills the scientist.

7. It takes five months for the US to send special ops into Gotham? Really? Let's say Gotham is New York, which it is in this ponderous piece of crap. Let's say a terrorist was holding New York Hostage... for five months. You're telling me that the citizens of New York, that the military of the United States, that the nuclear scientists of the world... are going to let that happen? That the people won't rise up immediately, that the military won't have drones flying around constantly looking for radiation signatures and have infiltrated the whole damn island with special ops, that the scientists won't figure out a way to drop EMP pulse grenades across the island to shut down the mechanical device that triggers the fission explosion? Five months of just sitting on their hands?

8. An atomic explosion off the coast of Gotham, and everything's cool! No worries! Radiation fallout? Na. Poisoned ocean? Forget about it. No big deal.

9. And the worst crime of all, the co-opting of the OCCUPY RHETORIC to disenfranchise the movement. Occupy Wall St. slogans are readily and repeatedly spoken by a monstrous, mad, deceiving, mass murdering terrorist. Do we ever see the plight of the average joe in DK Rises? Never. Which is shocking since there are about 300 characters, each with more screen time than Batman. What we get is a real life political movement used in the fictional service of Kangaroo Courts, martial law, and dictatorship. I don't care if Nolan meant for Bane to be using the language of Occupy for his own corrupt and selfish ends, it's irresponsible filmmaking.

And that's just some of the eye-rolling stupidity packed into this thing.

All and all, DK Rises is tedious, boring crap."
A thrilling epic conclusion to the dark knight film saga. this has to be one of the best ending films of all time Christopher Nolan did an excellent job the effects were great the music was cool the plot was amazing the characters were well thought of and the dark feeling of it make it amazing. people lets give Christopher Nolan a long applause
"The perfect conclusion to the perfect trilogy.

Nolan's third and final installment of this series is one of the most hard hitting, emotional thrill rides I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing. The final resolution is executed in the most beautifully cinematic way possible. I don't have any criticism of this film at all, it's such a carefully crafted film that if I had to list something negative, I would have to nitpick, and in this 2 hour and 40 minute classic, that simply would be an exercise in futility. The film gets so much right with it's themes and characters, that it hits every note perfectly just like it's two predecessors do. 10/10"
"In 2012, director Christopher Nolan delivered the epic conclusion to his groundbreaking Batman trilogy with ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Set against the backdrop of Gotham City's descent into chaos, this gripping tale of redemption, sacrifice, and heroism solidified Nolan's status as a visionary filmmaker and left audiences spellbound from start to finish.

From the jaw-dropping action sequences to the thought-provoking themes woven throughout the narrative, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a cinematic tour de force that transcends the superhero genre. At its core, the film explores the timeless struggle between good and evil, as Batman, portrayed with raw intensity by Christian Bale, grapples with his own inner demons while facing off against the formidable villain Bane, played with chilling menace by Tom Hardy.

What sets ""The Dark Knight Rises"" apart from other superhero films is its depth and complexity. Nolan skillfully crafts a multi-layered narrative that challenges viewers to confront difficult questions about power, justice, and the nature of heroism. As the stakes escalate and Gotham teeters on the brink of destruction, the film forces us to reckon with the consequences of our actions and the choices we make in the pursuit of a better world.

Visually stunning and thematically rich, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a feast for the senses that demands to be experienced on the big screen. From the breathtaking aerial shots of Gotham's skyline to the pulse-pounding showdowns between Batman and his adversaries, every frame is meticulously crafted to immerse viewers in the dark and gritty world of Gotham City.

In addition to its spectacular action sequences, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is anchored by a stellar ensemble cast that delivers powerhouse performances across the board. Anne Hathaway shines as the enigmatic cat burglar Selina Kyle, while Michael Caine delivers a heart-wrenching portrayal of Bruce Wayne's loyal butler, Alfred. Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt round out the ensemble with performances that are both compelling and nuanced.

Overall, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a triumph of storytelling and filmmaking that delivers on every level. With its exhilarating action, thought-provoking themes, and unforgettable performances, it cements Christopher Nolan's legacy as one of the greatest directors of our time and solidifies Batman's status as a cultural icon. Whether you're a die-hard fan of the Caped Crusader or simply a lover of great cinema, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a must-watch that will leave you breathless until the very end."
"Batman has defeated Ras-al-Ghul and his ninjas. He's defeated the Joker, a madman who only wanted to see the world burn. But now he faces Bane, a man who grew up in the world's darkest, cruelest dungeon. A man so dangerous he was excommunicated from the League of Shadows. A man with thousands of followers and millions of dollars at his disposal. And despite what the people closest to him say, Gotham needs Batman more than ever. Because in order to live up to his last Batman movie, Christopher Nolan has upped every stake and pulled every stop.

Looking back, it's obvious that no one could top Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker. None of the other villains in Batman's rouges gallery could be as frightening or disturbing as his Joker. But in Ed Hardy's Bane, Nolan has found a villain more powerful and far more dangerous. Bane is perhaps the ultimate physical combatant; massive, incredibly strong, all but impervious to pain. Comic book fans know him as the man who put Bruce Wayne in a wheelchair, and here he does worse. And he is very smart, and totally insane. The Joker was like a serial killer, a mad dog. Bane's madness is one of megalomania and unfettered hatred. The Joker sought to corrupt; he seeks to dominate and to destroy.

And yet he has the gall to present himself as a hero, a liberator. After entombing the entire police force and taking Gotham hostage, he claims that he is giving the city back to the people, that he is giving them freedom from those in power who have oppressed and exploited them, that he has brought justice and equality. But he lies. His freedom is nothing more than anarchy, the freedom to kill and steal. His justice is a mockery of the word in which having too much wealth or being part of the old order are capital crimes. His equality is the wholesale liquidation of the rich, leaving a world in which everyone is equally poor. In throwing down the old order built on law and the power of wealth, he has built a new one based on fear and the power of the gun. And it's all just preparation for ultimate destruction.

Against this mad warlord Batman's help comes from the unlikeliest of sources; master thief Catwoman (Anne Hathaway). When we meet her she's motivated only by money and self preservation, and like any good thief she convinces herself that t she's only stealing from those who can afford to lose it. She warns Batman that there's a storm coming, and he and his friends had best prepare. But when her storm arrives she realizes the old truth that you should be careful what you wish for. Hathaway's charm and wit make her perfect for this role, and her acrobatic fighting moves are stunning. I think it's safe to say that the last remaining taint of the Halle Berry version has been lifted from the character.

Nolan has outdone himself with the action sequences. The opening scene is every bit as forceful and unsettling as the one in Dark Night, with a coolness factor that rivals the best of James Bond. The climactic battle between Gotham's finest and Bane's thugs is one of the largest and most spectacular scenes of its kind, with hundreds of combatants crowding the city streets.. And the fights between Batman and Bane are everything fanboys could hope for. Eschewing precision and flair, these showdowns are brutally physical, with the effects of every blow being seen and heard. For me, this was one of the most satisfying brawls since Sean Connery took on Robert Shaw nearly fifty years ago.

This final installment in the franchise doesn't have a many twists and turns as its predecessor, but the ones it does have are still impressive. Bane's plans are a bit simpler than the Joker's, but no less genius, and he is equally as adept at predicting his opponents' moves. And although leaked information from an entertainment blog had given me foreknowledge of one major revelation, I was totally unprepared for the manner of this revelation and its effect on the story.

This is also a film rich with subtext. Bane's violent overthrow of Gotham's powers that be and his iron-fisted reign form a microcosm of countless violent revolutions. It could easily be a stand for the French Revolution, the Ayatollah's rise in Iran, or any of the various communist revolutions. In a period of unprecedented bloodshed and chaos, a determined man overthrows the old regime, only to replace it with one far worse. And just like Stalin or Mao, Bane knows that he's not doing any of this for the people. The only difference is that he doesn't even need to win public support, because he already has his mercenaries and thousands of released convicts.

The Dark Knight Rises may not be as scary as the last film, it's not quite as deep, and I will admit that it lacks any performance to equal Heath Ledger's. But it is smart, thrilling, action packed and suspenseful. It's dark and brooding without being overpowering, and it does an excellent job of linking the narrative back to the first film. It is the summer's best movie and a worthy end for the Dark Night Trilogy."
"I have not seen the movie but I read a post on Facebook I really liked. That Christian Bale should visit the kids who were injured by the Aurora killings,in the real Batman suit. Please post this to Facebook, other IMDb reviews, etc. And so he can show the kids that heroes really do exist,not just the evil people Satan has affected. He is working overtime because he knows his time is almost up. Dear Christian Bale, please visit the injured children from the movie massacre as Batman, you have the power to be a hero right now,not a movie hero,a real life flesh and bone one. I did not write this I found it on Facebook, I stole it because it was amazing what this person put on Facebook."
"Great film with some stunning effects and shots, such as the homage to King Kong with a 180 degree pan of Batman on top of Gotham building. Great actors, but what happened to the sound? Seems a lot of the dialogue is unintelligible to native English speakers over 45 years old. My kids could hear fine, but my wife and I and the press at the London screening couldn't decipher the dialogue at times. 'Most of us at the press show couldn't even hear the dialogue' said Nigel Andrews, the Financial Times reviewer on July 19th 2012.

I don't know about you, but I hate missing out on dialogue, especially in a Nolan film where there are bound to be great subtleties at play that will heighten the overall film experience. So the chief sound editor should certainly be up for a Razzie. Trouble is, there doesn't look in the crew list like there was a chief sound editor and perhaps that was the problem."
"This is so great. A great finale to one of the best trilogies of all time. Tom Hardy, Anne Hathaway and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are great additions to the cast and they give an amazing performance. The main characters are all so incredible. And the film is intense and full of breathtaking moments. Including a great plot twist. This gives an amazing ending that leaves the viewer wanting more from it. Overall an excellent film. Score - 10"
"disagreeing with most reviews i've read so far i thought the movie was flat. It just seem to never find it's footing. i found myself bored at times and had no problem getting up to get more popcorn in the middle of the movie. Catwoman was awesome. i really wish there was more of her in the movie. bane was not quite as awesome. he just didn't give me that omg what is he going to do feeling that i got with heath. I also dislike that they reused plot items from previous installments, it would have been better without the connection. The middle of the movie is like a long montage that could have been given some theme music and condensed to about 10 min. dkr had an overall bad flow which brushed over things that could have been flushed out more and dwelled on things that could have done with out.

The movie is worth a watch but don't expect to be blown away like with the dark knight."
"I am a huge fan of batman director Christopher Nolan. He is the genius who brought us such groundbreaking films as Memento and Inception, the very good Batman Begins and the excellent The Dark Night.

That's why my hopes for this third installment were so high. Boy was i disappointed.

This movie is a GRAND MESS. Here are some of the reasons why:

Nolan cuts off batman's balls and holds them hostage the entire movie. He is either hobbling around as Bruce Wayne looking like he belongs in a Senior's Home or in his batman's suit trading punches like an aged boxer with MS. No great fight scenes in the inimitable batman style with the whooshing and swooshing and swooping and gadgets and disappearances/reappearances.

I would conjecture that this is both because of the post modern philosophy adopted that no man is a true hero (including batman) and also more practically because the fight team was actually changed from the first two movies to a new one for this film, a change drastically for the worse. They should have stuck to the Keysi Fighting Method.

Another error is that any movie is only as good as its villain and Bane is a horrible villain. He's really more like a big goon that the main villain usually sends in the eleventh hour to do his bidding like the big Russian guy in the Punisher for example. Don't expect another performance like Ledger's Joker here.

What really gets me though, is how the second film developed the whole origin of Twoface as Harvey Dent (who was a great character) and then just dropped it and brought in a much worse villain????

Extremely irritating was Nolan superimposing the Inception style of for example heavy background music etc on this film where it doesn't belong. Even the dialogue was hard to always pick out, especially when you have two of the main characters growling through masks and the war drums right beneath their voices.

But it didn't stop there. Nolan invited almost the entire Inception cast and stuck them into this film inflating the story by giving them non- essential roles and by constantly taking you out of the illusion of reality a film is supposed to create when it forces another much better film to come to mind. He and his buds must have been having such a good time on set enjoying the Inception reunion that they must have forgot they were filming an entirely different movie.

The cherry on the top of this egregious casting is when in the middle of the film you suddenly have a cameo by none other than Cilian Murphy the scarecrow villain in the first Batman movie as some minor people elected judge. (And yes, you guessed it, he was also in Inception). To me that's tantamount to giving Heath Ledger (Joker) or Aaron Eckhart (Harvey Dent) a role as a cop or a waiter in this film. Seriously man, is there anything else you can do wrong to break the movie spell and keep reminding me i'm only watching a film with actors- something totally fake?

I wish i could stop here but honestly i could go on and on. The movie spends time with characters whose story lines are not that interesting and leads up to a cliché climax that you and i have seen done in previous TV shows like 24 and other films.

I believe the production suffered from the all too common problem of having too large a budget (250 million) that enabled Nolan to create a spectacle of ""Sound and Fury Signifying Nothing"" instead of an interesting film. The film alternates between dragging with boring exposition and blasting your ears off with nonsense. There is a tender moment between Bruce and Alfred that is very brief that was nice though ;)....

Guys, I went into the theatre ready to love this film, willing to try to like it, but it never even gave me the chance.

Unfortunately it does not live up to the hype. Like the Godfather Part 3, there is no reason to watch it even though you enjoyed the great Parts 1 and 2.

Let sleeping dogs lie and let dead films die. For your own sake, do not break the caution tape to watch this wretched bomb of a film."
"A very satisfying ending to a great trilogy that leaves you wanting even more. Not just a good superhero movie, but a great movie overall. This is my favorite movie of all time hands down. Acting is phenomenal and brings one of my childhood idols to light in a cinematic masterpiece that Christopher Nolan created which tailors to a more adult audience. Solid 9.95/10."
"The Dark Knight Rises may not only be my favorite Batman movie of all time (yes I like it more than The Dark Knight), but it may also be my favorite movie of all time. There are no words to describe how much I love this movie. The Dark Knight Rises has one of the best endings in the history of film. Bane is one of the best villains of all time and I wish that he got more attention. 10/10"
"The Dark Knight Rises, helming a rating of 8.4 on IMDB and still a high holder on the top 250 movies list is a prove that despite some people feeling dissatisfied towards this epic conclusion, it is still universally beloved as a movie, and as one might dare to say, a great superhero movie.

Watching this film for the first time in theaters, with no knowledge of filmmaking, not even a movie fan at that time, just a normal audience going in the theatres for a ride, I remember coming out completely satisfied and floored. This film still crowns the most pristine look for an action film. The cinematography, the snow falling in the city of Gotham, everything about the visuals of this film is just screaming awesomeness, and for the longest time I hold this film as the pinnacle of the best looking action film and I still do.

In many ways, the minor flaws in here is so insignificant compare to the memorable bits of the film. This rendition of cat woman is by far the best one ever. Anne Hathaway achieves the perfect balance of sexiness and the feminine wit in this character, the visual design is also perfect. Bane is such an underrated villain, Tom Hardy adds so much on the character's simple motivation, the menace through his voice and his physicality rivals Batman and his energy brought so much to the tension we felt in the film. The opening and ending scene is one of the best in movie cinema.

One of my favourite aspects of this film is how Nolan coins the genre of the superhero saga into a prison break movie. The design of the pit is visually so mesmerizing, every time the camera points up to the light and we see the cave of the prison, the picture just becomes this visceral canvas of beauty in horror. The moment when Bruce Wayne confronts his true fear by foregoing the only security from the rope, it's honestly so badass that it trumps every other character moment in any Marvel movies and DC movies for that matter.

After so many years, there's still not one DCEU movie that achieves this style of epic grounded action thriller where Nolan single-handedly master in Hollywood. It's only until 2016 where Denis Villeneuve finally managed to make something that comes close to that level of authentic grandness.

The Dark Knight Rises also has the best score in the trilogy in my opinion, the best score for any hero movies, the perfect balance of grandness, epicness, the unsung melancholy and the haunting beauty of romantic sacrifice."
"I think the protagonist of this movie isn't BATMAN, but Joseph Gordon, who grew up in the orphanage and played the role of police inspector ""BLAKE"". If Blake wasn't there, Gotham had gone out hand :)"
"Fantastic film. Everything about the film is perfect. The cgi is amazing, acting is prefect, script is effective, plot is quick and exciting. To top the film off, the ending is also enjoyable rather than being boring and generic"
"And Christopher Nolan's genre-changing series of Batman films finally comes to a close with THE DARK KNIGHT RISES. No matter what your opinions are of Nolan's Batman movies, you have to admit that they've had an effect on latest generation of superhero movies to arrive in theaters. With his trilogy finally complete and the all those involved moving on to other projects, I'll be curious to see where the comic book movie genre goes next. When I first saw THE DARK KNIGHT RISES in theaters (a midnight showing, of course, and one of the few I've attended), I admit I was initially disappointed but additional viewings have helped me appreciate it a lot more. The movie is set eight years following the events of THE DARK KNIGHT with Batman going on the run and the true details of Harvey Dent's death buried in hopes of using him as Gotham's shining hero. The city has enjoyed a time of peace as crime is at an all-time low, but this is all about to change. A terrorist named Bane has his sights set on Gotham. He arises under the guise as a freedom fighter with the goal of bringing the upper class to their knees while the lower class are allowed to rise to power, but Bane is no hero. Bruce Wayne returns to don the costume and investigate Bane but his time away from crime fighting has left him weakened. His initial confrontation with Bane leaves him broken, and Wayne must find the strength to return and, with help from a professional cat burglar, save Gotham from total destruction.

To put my views in perspective, I am a Nolan fan and I love his Batman movies. THE DARK KNIGHT is one of my favorite movies and I loved BATMAN BEGINS so much that it was one of the few movies I shelled out cash to see in theaters multiple times. So yes, my views are a little skewed toward the positive side. But my initial impressions of the final movie weren't as generous. It was a fine movie, sure, but it failed to live up to the immense hype I'd built in my own mind prior to seeing the movie. I knew Nolan would have a hard time topping THE DARK KNIGHT and I accepted this. I also reminded myself that Nolan's Batman universe isn't exactly the same as that of the comics and details were going to be fudged to make them fit in the overarching story he was attempting to tell. With a near 3 hour runtime, I was in no mood to humor these factors when I saw it in theaters and I walked away befuddled with my issues with the movie. It was slower paced, Wayne doesn't don the costume enough in the movie, and the finale was anticlimactic. But, over time and two more viewings on my own, I realize that this movie was a lot better than I was giving it credit for. Sure, there are still some plot issues I'm not a fan of but I remind myself that this is Nolan's Batman and any problems I have will probably be retcon'd in the next Batman reboot anyway. Just enjoy the Nolan series for what it is. And I do.

At a second glance, there is a lot about this movie I really like. Tom Hardy as Bane is just awesome. His bizarre voice took a minute to become acclimated with; it reminded me of Sean Connery talking through a tin can. Once I got used to his voice, Bane rose to become one of the best Batman villains that have been put to film yet, though not as remarkable as Heath Ledger's Joker (but, seriously, I don't see anyone topping that anytime soon). He is massive, intimidating presence and a perfect challenge for a Batman who's fallen into disrepair. What better motivation to rise than a madman with an insidious plan and the muscle to pound our hero into dust? On a related note, Anne Hathaway was an excellent choice for Catwoman/Selina Kyle. I was concerned at his casting at the beginning, but then I was just as concerned when Ledger was announced as Joker and my fears were proved unjustified when I saw his final performance. Hathaway does just as well; a cool manipulatorshe's beautiful but her sexiness isn't flaunted as it was in Burton's BATMAN RETURNS. I've also come to appreciate the overall plot of the film as an excellent finish to the series. It touches back on elements introduced in the first two movies and ties everything together nicely; you might almost assume Nolan had this planned from the start. I'm pretty sure he didn't, but it worked out great. The end has been caused for endless debate and complaints but, as long as I view it as an isolated Batman tale set in Nolan's own universe with no long-standing effect on the future Batman movies, I'm cool with it. I actually think it's a perfect end for the story Nolan has been building since 2005."
"well, I saw batman last night and was rather underwhelmed really. despite having a natural dislike of Bales batman, I had high hopes for Nolans direction. I won't give away any spoilers, the trailers pretty much encapsulate the rather two dimensional plot entirely. Anne Hathaway was good, played her role better than any predecessor. I was hoping for a film with batman (after struggling to 'become' batman in the previous two films) would fulfil a more alpha role. tom hardy was better than expected, but I really did struggle to understand him sometimes. his character is supposed to be a tactical genius, as well as a superb fighter, and this didn't really come across. finally, you end up not caring about most of the cast as they are all 'damaged' and selfish. but most of all, batman seems rather desperate, and seemed to have shut down that big brain of his. not a spoiler - but there is also one scene that emulates perfectly all those YouTube Mick takes too, I actually laughed out loud as it were. the film wallows through its three long hours, I would cut it to two and a half. actually, the more I think about it, I realise there wasn't that much I enjoyed in the film! ah well, it didn't measure up to avengers or Prometheus, but it was better than the second bale batman offering (but not as good as the first - which was 'ok')."
"""The dark knight rises"" isn't the perfect film but it is definitely the most emotional of all three. Yeah i said it (but neither were the previous two). But i would be lying if i was telling you that i did not have goosebumps in numerous scenes or wet eyes during some of the most honestly acting (and touching) moments in the history of cinema. This time around, Bruce Wayne is being tested mentally and physically against Bane and his hordes for the salvation (or destruction) of Gotham city. However, what really works here and makes all the way through our heart and emotions are the sharply drawn and fleshed out characters. There will be people claiming that there is an large number of individuals that take lots of screen time, yet they actually feel and act as normal ""humans"" rather than archetypical Hollywood algorithms. Christian Bale should get a nomination for his work as Bruce Wayne. This is his finest Batman. You really root for him simply because like all of us, he has limits (spiritual and physical), limits that will be broken.

On the antagonist part, Tom Hardy as Bane is physically impressive. Make no mistake. This is not a well built body with perfect abs and biceps in order to lure teenage girls to the cinema. Instead Nolan's Bane is a colossal muscle mountain that could snap your spine in a split second without making the slightest of effort. Just like the edgy and twitchy Joker, his unique body language and swaggering mannerisms will certainly leave an impact to the viewer's mind and rightly to do so.

However, do i hear show stealer? Anne Hathaway - she is a fully lethal, sexy ass kicking babe. I cannot believe i am writing this but she was incredible! Of course she cannot fill Michelle Pfeiffer's (iconic) shoes simply because in the Tim Burtonland, Catwoman was a demented, emotionally scarred woman with certain supernatural status at the background and played more like a tragic villain. Here, Hathaway plays Selena Kyle as a sexy, independent, thief that is balancing between good and bad all the way through the film. A fitting antihero and blurred line between Batman's justice and Bane's menace. What i really enjoyed is how similar she looks, sounds, talks and moves like her counterpart in the animated series, comics and videogames. She is even waving that ass with a cat like pose. I absolutely loved this character!

The rest of the (multiple) cast are doing what they are doing best servicing the reliable (and sometimes surprising) story written by Nolan and Goyer. Both have done their homework with Nolan's direction becoming even more confident than before. His camera sweeps and embraces the vast cityscape of Gotham, day and (much more impressively) in the night. His exquisite taste for night time shots is something that deserves the IMAX ticket alone and brings back memories when Michael Mann used to be a cool director. But what about the script? How can a film surpass the heavy expectations of the Oscar worthy ""Dark knight""? Wel, it doesn't, but instead it goes around them. How do you follow that? You can't. Thus Nolan and co-s have done the wise decision of not repeating themselves terminating unwanted comparisons with the previous installments. The first entry was focused to the personal spiritual odyssey of a man and the second evolved into a crime thriller about masked vigilantes and themes of anarchy fused with (in)justice. On the other hand, the third chapter goes back to conclude the journey and the degenerated anarchy, brings back everything (and everyone) together and ties them nicely in the vast present of terrorism and economic prevalence (in a lesser degree). The Joker was full of surprises and meaningless through his performance reflecting the psychotic personality. Bane has a plan - to destroy Gotham city, to live in order to see its ashes. He doesn't want chaos, he wants order through chaos which is an interesting concept. The layout of anger, injustice, blurred morality (chase the Batman the vigilante or the robbers?) and motives is displayed through a complex array of events and almost possible situations (military law anyone?) that can be thought provoking and mind feeding.

Certain twists and turns do exist to maintain our thrilling interest to the sky but if you are a devoted Batman comic book guy, then you know kinda the story. ""The dark knight rises"" reaches superior film level status when it comes to powerful emotional scenes and outstanding sequences that will have your heart filled with grief and your sentiments exploding (for spoiler reasons i cannot mention any of these). The exceptional score by Hans Zimmer underlines and sometimes more than enough enhances the power of the unfolding events on screen into our mind. The A-class acting manages to inject real pathos and drama into the proceedings and this is what lacks from the movies nowdays. A good story, a fantastic cast and a large group of crew members that could make films like these possible. The movie is exceptionally shot, the action is plenty and more epic than before and the fight sequences between Batman and Bane are astonishing, especially their first encounter.

""The dark knight rises"" is an experience and should be seen in IMAX. There is ground here for even more psychological exploration and doubts about moral responsibilities that could reflect into our reality. This is a fitting and satisfying conclusion to the legend of the dark knight. Probably the world's best trilogy?"
"Not a bad movie but very disappointing if your expect a Batmanmovie...

We all know how ridiculous the first Batman movies where. But the where batman all over! Those movies where exactly how you portrait Batman. Yes they where 80's movies, over-acted and in many ways ridiculous... so? I loved them, because they where Batman!

The Dark Night started of great. A storyline what explained missing parts in the Batman legacy. Batman in this century. Great armor, wonderful costumes, perfect mood setting, grain and color...

I alway's thought Ledger was epic, but now we are making more of him than needed. And maybe that's where Nolan is making his first mistake... You simply can not top Ledgers apparency. You also can't top the clever designed toy's. It was good enough. all of it!

So if you make a third AND FINAL Batman movie... go out with a BANG!

That didn't happen.

It didn't even felt like Batman at all...

An empty feeling after leaving the cinema. Mostly because you know it will take 20 years from now somebody will try it again. So this is it. This is Batman 2000."
"Going out with a bang doesn't even begin to describe ""The Dark Knight Rises"", the final installment of Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. The film runs over 2 hours and 30 minutes but keeps you interested at all times (the main problem I had with the otherwise excellent ""The Dark Knight"" was that its pacing felt uneven and it got a little boring at times) and keeps upping the tension every minute leading up to what is indeed an epic conclusion. The film picks up eight years after ""the Dark Knight"", with the city of Gotham almost crime-free due to Batman taking the blame for the death of Harvey Dent. But it turns out to be the calm before the biggest threat Gotham has ever faced  a revolution led by the menacing Bane (Tom Hardy) and his henchmen. Meanwhile Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) has retired from the public eye with only his butler Alfred (Michael Caine) to keep him company. However, a mysterious criminal named Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) and threat of Gotham's destruction makes him rise from the shadows again. Christian Bale, Michael Caine and the other actors (Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and Liam Neeson) who previously appeared in the series reprise their roles with ease and seem to push their acting to the very limit since it's the last installment. Especially Bale and Oldman have never been better in their roles. But it's the new additions to the cast that really lifts this movie to a higher level. Hathaway, whose casting I definitely had some doubts about, plays Selina/Catwoman perfectly  an extraordinary mix of strength and vulnerability. Marion Cotillard in the other ""love interest"" role blows previous Batman paramours Maggie Gyllenhaal and Katie Holmes out of the water. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is also wonderful as John Blake, a policeman with strong beliefs. But it's Tom Hardy as Bane that really made the film for me. Not only is he truly terrifying at times, but he also manages to make the character sympathetic and complex. But the true star of the film is director (and co-screenwriter) Cristopher Nolan. As a previous fan of his work I was looking forward to this film with very high expectations and some fear that it wouldn't live up to the hype. My expectations were not matched  they were exceeded. The depth of the story was immense; it provoked lots of thoughts about society and our values and had a huge emotional impact on me. Credit for the cinematographer, the composer (Hans Zimmer truly is the greatest composer of today) and the special effects team is also due. Never have I ever felt as truly satisfied with every aspect of a film as I did with this one. So to summarize ""The Dark Knight Rises"" it is one of the best films I have ever seen and the absolute best one in the trilogy. It makes almost all other films pale in comparison to its grandeur and even if it won't be the box office winner of the year (which it very well may be) it's going to be a classic for years to come. As I try to describe how great it was I realize that it isn't possible  because it was so much more than great. This is a movie isn't just a movie. It's a future legend."
"I just saw TDKR in IMAX with my Mom, and I have just one word for it... WHOA! I was really impressed with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, but this one... I'm sorry but I'm still in awe of this movie. The best Batman movie I've ever seen, and maybe the best MOVIE I've ever seen. Since the final scene in The Dark Knight when Batman is riding the Bat-Pod and disappears into downtown Gotham, I've been waiting four years to see what direction Christopher Nolan and the rest of the crew and cast would take. Now that we've finally reached the release of ""The Dark Knight Rises"", I'm extremely happy to say that I was completely blown away by this movie. Usually threequels tend not to do so good, but this is one of the few that are outstanding!

Story (No spoilers): 8 years have passed since the Joker's rampage, and Batman has not been seen since he has taken the fall for Harvey Dent/Two-Face's crimes. Bruce Wayne is now a recluse, and is clearly emotionally damaged by his experiences as Batman, and his loss of his childhood sweetheart Rachel Dawes. The crime rate in Gotham City has quieted down, but that peacetime is short lived when a new threat arrives. A threat even worse than what the Joker had in store for Gotham... BANE. Batman is then forced to come out of hiding to stop Bane's reign of terror.

The acting as always is top notch: Christian Bale is an excellent and believable Batman/Bruce Wayne, and accurately shows the complexity of the character. This is probably his best portrayal of Bruce Wayne since we get a really good insight on Bruce Wayne much like the insight we got on Peter Parker in Spider-Man 2, and how Bruce must rise above his personal demons once again and become Batman in his heart and mind. Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle/Catwoman really surprised me. I loved her performances in some of her other movies, but this performance is probably her best yet! She is the best Catwoman ever put on screen! Tom Hardy as Bane, while he may not be as interesting as the Joker he's still an awesome villain. Tom Hardy's performance as Bane is phenomenal, and he is one of the most exciting and most terrifying villain I've ever seen. He's physically superior to Batman which is shown in the first confrontation between the two characters, which was so intense by the way. I like how his physical appearance was changed for this movie because the expressions in his eyes makes him more intimidating. And yes his voice was much more easier to understand this time, even though there are times you may not clearly understand what he said. Plus, Tom Hardy's Bane made me forget all about Joel Schumacher's version of Bane in ""Batman and Robin"", and that's saying something. As for the rest of the cast, Michael Caine (he got me teary eyed a few times in this one), Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Marion Cotilliard and Joseph Gordon-Levitt (awesome as usual, and his character has a surprising story arc at the end) are fantastic in their roles. Heck, anyone who had a small part or anyone who was an extra should be proud that they were even in this movie! Lastly the directing: Christopher Nolan has done such a superb job with telling his story of Batman, and I congratulate him for making a trilogy that is probably the best I've ever seen.

The moment this movie started, I was completely drawn into it from beginning to the end, as was everybody else in the theater. No spoilers, but there were twists and turns that I didn't expect to happen, some scenes with funny lines (especially some of the scenes between Lucius Fox and Bruce Wayne, and between Bruce Wayne/Batman and Selina Kyle/Catwoman) and yes some romance. And the way the film ends (without spoiling anything) was perfect. All the loose ends that were open throughout the trilogy were wrapped up so nicely.

The visual effects once again were amazing and I liked the scene at the football stadium. The music by Hans Zimmer is mind blowing, and I don't think you could come up with a better score for Batman than this! And I also love the look of Gotham City in this one. Unlike the last two films which were filmed in Chicago, most of it this time was filmed in NYC, and some of the shots were filmed in Los Angeles and Pittsburgh. Plus I was able to pick out a few spots obviously since most of this was filmed in NYC, since my family is from NYC.

This trilogy once again is probably the best that I've ever seen, and it's definitely the kind of trilogy we'll be telling our kids about in 20 years time much like our parents told us about Star Wars. These three movies have given me such great experiences and memories that I will remember forever, and I'm absolutely going to miss the hype that comes with waiting for Nolan's next Batman, but I think he's right when he says it's time for the story to come to an end. I'm not kidding when I say this: Check this one out because, you're in for one hell of a ride!

(This is in light of the tragic shooting in Colorado: may God take care of the victims that are now with Him, the families of those who were killed and may He help the family of the shooter get through this terrible ordeal he's put them through.)

Update: I still think this film is great, and I don't really see any problems or plot holes like people keep insisting there is. This was a solid ending to the trilogy and nothing more."
"Questions were asked from this film even before its conception ? Can it match its predecessor? Well the answer is, It has passed its predecessor. Nolan has outdone again this time there was no anarchy in streets of Gotham but a revolution. The fight will always remain between good and bad but the players here were ordinary citizen. Hardy made Bane look like a fanatic catching its essence and its revolt. Hathway was not only sexy but also stellar. This time there was no mighty Batman but Nolan shows the man behind the mask who can fail and also can RISE.You have to see it twice not because there is no sequel for it"
"In 2005 Christopher Nolan gave us Batman Begins, a near-perfect film detailing the story of Bruce Wayne and his journey to becoming Batman. This film brought Batman out from the depths of movie hell, there courtesy of Joel Schumacher's appalling Batman Forever and Batman & Robin, which turned Batman into a joke who no one would want to touch with 10-foot pole. Thankfully Nolan was brave enough to resurrect him in 2005, and in 2008 we got The Dark Knight, a film which turned what we knew about blockbusters and superhero flicks upside-down. With a phenomenal performance by Heath Ledger and an even darker journey into Gotham City this was a perfect film.

Now, after four years, Nolan concludes his epic trilogy with The Dark Knight Rises. There is no denying the hype for this movie is huge, people are bound to be disappointed, fans divided and angry, but when after I finished watching this (after having attended a back-to-back trilogy screening on an IMAX screen) I realised just how fitting this movie was. These aren't simple superhero movies with loud noises and non-stop action, he has imbued each character with true personalities and the story with multiple themes. Bruce Wayne became Batman in the beginning, fell into dark times in the middle and rose to become Gotham's hero in the end. Emotions run high in this final installment as Batman comes out of hiding to face a truly menacing villain along with the people close to him.

Eight years after the events of The Dark Knight Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) is in hiding and his corporation is going broke, but the emergence of Bane (Tom Hardy), a mercenary with a dark past out for trouble, and Selina Kyle/Catwoman (Anne Hathaway) bring Wayne out of retirement. Now Batman, along with up and coming Detective Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman), Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), Alfred (Michael Caine) and newcomer millionaire Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard) must try and save Gotham from Bane and his mercenaries.

Where do I start with reviewing this movie? There is much to say and an unfortunate limit on my word count so I will be brief. The acting is outstanding from each cast member, Bale has been so good as Wayne/Batman and he completes his character arc with raw emotion. Hardy is exceptional as Bane, physically intimidating and always a scene-stealer, most of the film's best scenes involve Bane addressing a large crowd or brutalising anyone in his way. Hathaway does well as Catwoman, neither hero or villain she is a complex character who I wish we saw more of. Of course Oldman, Cotillard and Freeman are excellent, but I must mention Michael Caine who really shone in this film, delivering an award-worthy final turn as everyone's favourite butler. Finally Joseph Gordon-Levitt is proving again and again he is becoming one of the best actors of our time, he does a fantastic job as the optimistic detective who never loses hope.

Nolan's direction is perfect and his script (co-written with his brother Jonathon) is an emotional roller-coaster packed with some truly breathtaking action set-pieces filmed in glorious IMAX. Cities crumble, bridges collapse and civil wars are fought and look fantastic, thank you Nolan for not shooting in 3D! Hans Zimmer's score suits the tone of the film well, the now very well known chant is used to good effect in a pivotal scene towards the end.

This is a truly cinematic experience, expertly blending the action genre with drama, creating a fitting final act to Nolan's Batman trilogy. I may seem to be heaping too much praise on this movie, but really, it deserves it, it is engrossing and quite simply one of the best films I've seen in a long, long time. Nolan's Batman trilogy is possibly one of the greatest conceived and it will be a long time before a superhero movie of this calibre will be made.

10/10"
"Disappointed as a viewer. The worst thing a film can do it to make the viewer step out of the film and say ""Give me a break"" If the film interrupts the viewing, it is flawed.

Give me a break. Detonation of an atomic bomb off the coast of Gotham? The aftermath: Huge waves, devastation to the city. Radiation fall out for years. The suggestion that Batman is alive is also absurd. He had 5 seconds to detonation and had not dropped the bomb. NO WAY he could have reached any kind of escape velocity. And if his BAT vehicle submerged, which I doubt it did. He could not have survived the radioactivity and heat generated by the blast. This is just stupid writing. The film makers should have resorted to another scenario.

Next, the entire police force crowded together in a massive mob heading toward city hall. That is just stupid. It may have worked in an old 1930s movie where UNION workers confronted private police and then fought it out with CLUBS, but to walk into a direct assault of canons? Have we learned nothing since the CIVIL WAR. Battles are not fought that way anymore. The police would have spread out, infiltrated the city hall via underground passages, used ropes to repel from buildings, and overwhelmed the bad guys, not walk in to certain death. The entire attack on city hall was plain stupid. Another example of pulling the viewer out of the film and making him say ""What the Hell?"".

In fact, the movie should have been called BATMAN and CATWOMAN. Ann Hathaway was an equal to the Dark Knight and I might say did more to save the city that he did.

BANE was a bad dude, psychotic and menacing, but his mask was his Achilles heel. It was much too vulnerable and as such was a stupid idea. If the mask was controlling his pain, he needed to have it protected. All of the punches to his face would have been more than enough to disable this Darth Vader Wannabe. I did like the use of the Sean Connery voice. It added a bit of class the the maniac's demeanor.

Also, having a Mideastern villain wanting revenge on Gotham? Old news since 911. Not very original.

The film does show how vulnerable modern cities are to terrorism, but DUH! that Old news as well.

Bottom Line. Too many flaws in logic and writing for me to really enjoy the film."
"Well, let's be honest. Heath Ledger played the Joker in the Dark Knight and we all know that he could not be topped. But Tom Hardy did a great job as the villain and the special effects helped. I personally think the Dark Knight was better than this one but not by much. Out of a scaled of 10, Dark knight was 20/10, it was better than perfect, and this new movie is a 10/10, still perfect. When I say that the dark knight is better that doesn't mean that I am saying the dark knight rises was worse.

The way the story develops, and the way it comes together is amazing. Christopher Nolan cannot disappoint, and if you are thinking about watching this movie, you are making a mistake. Don't think, just do (like the joker).

I also would like to spread out my condolences to the families of the victims of the shooting in Aurora. Please remember that the shooting has nothing to deal directly with the movie, so do not be scared. Enjoy the time you have. :)"
"As the film starts, it goes to the six minute prologue. You are left sitting there thinking you are in for a treat. And you would be right, for the last hour and 15 minutes. The next scene is at Wayne manor with Gordon saying his speech, and you think, this is just a boring scene, and will get better, but not for at least an hour and a half. The film is very enjoyably, and does not feel overlong, but starts of bad. It is a brilliant film, which was to be expected from the brilliant director, Christopher Nolan, just not as good as the dark knight, which no one expected it to be. I still highly recommend this film, just don't expect it to be the new shawshank redemption."
"This movie is deceptively amazing... the beginning starts off slow (so you think), then it get amazing... then better... then EVEN better. until the end where EVERYTHING comes together and you mind is blown into tiny batman shaped pieces. it leaves you speechless. Its beautiful, stunning, shocking, amazing. and props to the guy who wrote the music... cause that is some VERY good music right there. :) Christian Bale is the best Batman and you get too peer into Bruce Waynes ideals and what he is truly made of. not batman... but Bruce Wayne. Anne Hathoway is perfect Catwoman who is sly, sexy, and utterly awesome. Lastly, Tom Hardy is a perfect evil mastermind with a twist. he gives Bane life and emotions and an overall shockingly good portrayal of bane. And what a great twist in the movie. i NEVER saw it coming. go see the Dark Knight Rises NOW."
"The Dark Knight Rises is one of those rare films that you want to continue longer than its run time. The film is mind-blowingly awesome and I feel that the movie is immensely better than its predecessors. Why?

Well, for one, it has outstanding performances by each and every cast member and not once did I feel the acting to be corny or lame. The real standouts were, of course, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, and Tom Hardy. Bale returns to take up the mantle of Batman once again and he doesn't disappoint in any way. His butler Alfred also made this movie great because Michael Caine is such a fine actor who can really evoke your emotions. Tom Hardy's performance as Bane is indescribable. It is just so good. We all expect Bane to be ruthless,and he is, but he is also very smart and sophisticated. He is no shape or form similar in any way to the piece of sh*t Bane from Batman and Robin. That Bane was just a vomit-inducing dumbass. I consider Hardy to give the finest performance in the film. You just have to see him on screen. Anne Hathaway, Morgan Freeman, and the rest were also great in the film.

Secondly, the action along with the score make TDKR a film to watch. Batman is back after 8 years and he has a new vehicle at his disposal. The Bat-copter accounts for some action scenes in the film and it plays a crucial part in the story. Bane's physique, strength, and fighting skills are better than Batman's and the fighting scenes between them two makes you want to stand up and cheer. The score and soundtrack also alleviate the action and give the fight scenes a sense of epicness. We have Hans Zimmer to thank for that. Overall, the film's score makes every scene more better.

Finally, the story is very interesting and never becomes boring or makes you want the film to skip to the fighting already. Batman has to come out of his hiatus and take on Bane who is terrorizing Gotham City. The film cleverly explores Bane's background in order to give the reader a reason as to what causes him to become the madman that he is. Not everything is what it seems. I won't go into too much because I don't want to spoil anything.

I did have one issue with the film though. Bane's mask makes it hard to clearly understand what he is saying and a couple of times I had to ask my brother next to me what Bane just said. Even my brother didn't have a clue.

Anyway, I really enjoyed the film and I consider it to be one of the best superhero films made, even better than the Avengers - which I really liked.

'Over and Out.' 22nd of July, 2012."
"Watched it first day, first show. I'm a huge fan of the series so was going to watch it anyway, whether it was good or bad because generally the conclusion of any epic series isn't that satisfying. But....we forget it's Christopher Nolan who has directed this. I was actually speechless for a long time after the movie finished. It's PHENOMENAL!!!

It's worth every dime of your money and time spent (it's a long movie). It's full of stupefying, yet sensible, action, with an addition to Batman's armada of stunning vehicles. There are many twists and turns which keeps even the most seasoned of the audience guessing till a long time. All the acting is genuine (no question there!), the cinematography is bold and raw. Catwoman steals the hearts. And Bane, oh.. He is so bad and so tough! The direction is, as always, brilliant. In fact, Christopher Nolan has given everything he's got to this finale. It's dark, we can emotionally attach to, and feel, every situation and along with all this I would like to make the special mention of the music, the background score, by Hans Zimmer. I wouldn't be wrong in saying that this film wouldn't have got this legendary aura to it without the background music!

So, in short, whether you've watched earlier parts or not, it's an at least a must watch movie, three times!"
"This is my first review I want it to be simple TDKR is an epic conclusion to any superhero movie ever seen its lengthy and dark because of pressure of previous blockbuster TDK it builds up its story slowly n deserves multiple viewings to clarify every aspect its not fast paced as TDK but it is just like begins in terms of story telling and it is superior to every other super hero movies because it delivers what it promises and this is satisfying ending it doesn't leaves you frustrated TDKR completes on the great trilogies in movie history. Finally, I would like to thank Christopher Nolan for portraying Batman in a way no one ever thought was possible and for making one the best trilogy of all time."
"When Batman begins first came out I wasn't sure how you could do any better than the first Michael Keaton film. How wrong I was! Nolan has done a fantastic job reinventing the series, The sequel was almost as good as the first and gave us an outstanding performance from Heath Ledger which will always be remembered. So he had to get it right again and once again he does not disappoint.

There was always a worry for me that putting Catwoman into a comic book film that Nolan has really tried to keep as realistic as possible would add a camp over the top element to it but Anne Hathaway played it brilliantly and looked stunning in the tight leather outfit, I would have said cat suit but it's only hinted as one with a clever use of glasses for ears.

Tom Hardy was great as ever, he even managed to show his emotions through a thick mask. Once again another incredibly memorable bad guy has been brought to us. My only criticisms would be that occasionally it was difficult to understand what he was saying, I found myself having to really concentrate hard to follow the dialogue. Also without giving anything away he goes from a menacing, very intelligent force to be reckoned with that was always one step ahead of everyone, to a basic vulnerable thug quite quickly and I feel such a great character deserved a better finale.

I also found that if I thought too hard about what the overall logic behind the city destruction plan was there were several plot holes.....but this is not based on a true story and there was nothing too obvious to take you out of the action so it really didn't matter too much.

The film is quite long but moves at a relentless pace, with Hanz Zimmers pounding soundtrack to keep us gripped along with some incredible action scenes, sit back, switch off and let Bane and Batmans clash unfold in a nicely wrapped up ending to a fantastic trilogy, it's just a shame it's all over."
"I have always been a massive fan of the Batman comics, ever since I was a child I was asking for the Batmobile for Christmas, and even though it's terrible I'm still a fan of the Tim Burton reboot. (Now you really know I'm a die-hard fan) But with all that said, there was something about The Dark Knight Rises that didn't feel right to me.

Having seen it 4 times now I feel like I have a strong grasp on the entire film, and there are definitely some flaws that need pointing out, even though the majority of the film did leave me in awe. First of all I want to say that out of the trilogy; Batman Begins is my favourite. I love The Dark Knight, but it almost feels like 'filler' between Batman Begins and Dark Knight Rises, in that there's no real story to it, it's just what Batman did for about a month that lead to Rachel dying. I loved Batman Begins because although it showed Bruce over a long period of time, it didn't really miss out any details. There were no stones left unturned, every story arc had an ending, every Christopher Nolan placed cheesy joke had it's minute, and even the ending wasn't as clichéd as it sounds on paper, even if I do hate it for making me wait 3 years to meet the Joker. But with all the hype leading up to 'Rises, I feel like an unobtainable greatness was expected by me and a lot of other fans, and so it would always seem worse than the previous two. That's nothing against Nolan though, 'Rises is a fantastic film that I thoroughly enjoyed, but the only ending to a trilogy I have ever fully appreciated was Return of the King, but that's because it's such a masterpiece that the earlier films were dwarfed in comparison. So based on that 'Rises was destined to fail in my eyes.

That said, there were still parts of 'Rises that are truly awesome. Bane, for instance, is one of the best villains I have seen in any film, game, book, TV show, advert, comic or dental commercial ever. He's just so bad-ass, even with the ridiculous voice and perfectly smooth head; Tom Hardy manages to present this 'don' of a character that even Samurai-flipping-Jack would be frightened of, and he does it all with the majority of his face covered up. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman also deserves much credit. The 'Halle Berry Catwoman' was bitter sweet for me and much of the DC fan base, it no-doubt was a very, very poor film, but it was sexy as hell, and this is where I saw Anne Hathaway going wrong; I thought she'd try too hard to make a better character than Berry and end up making a Catwoman that pasty teenagers around the globe couldn't ""enjoy"". But rest assured universe; she ticked both boxes. Hathaway ended up creating a character with such a sense of mystique around her that I think we all ended up wanting her to have more screen time, just so we could work her out, well that and her uh..'delectable posterior' (to put it nicely). On top of that, there are so many moments in this film that have you on the edge of your seat, making involuntary ""phwwoaaaaarrr""-like noises. The bat-pods, for instance, are so much cooler than ever before, with the rolling-sideways-wheels and smashing into and through buildings. The collection of all 5 tumblers also had me giggling like a little girl, and even the small references to 'Killer Croc' made me grin uncontrollably.

There are, however, some faults with The Dark Knight Rises that I feel need to be covered. A couple of them are just nit-picking; such as how in hell didn't the football player realise the ground had collapsed behind him? and how did Batman survive the nuclear blast if two seconds from detonation we saw him pushing the throttle forward?! Even if he had ejected immediately after he would have been able to avoid the blast radius. Some of the faults are more substantial though. For example I feel like bringing Ra's Al Ghul back into the picture with his daughter ruined things a tad, having Bane, the man exiled from the league of shadows for being too extreme is enough I think, as they don't really deal with Talia after she escapes, they just kill Bane and dispose of the bomb. Secondly, I feel there were a few too many plot twists for the story to flow properly, I mean come on Nolan; It's the end of the best Batman trilogy ever made; you don't have to keep throwing in changes to make sure we don't get bored. Hell, the majority of us are going to love it even if it's awful.

Overall though it's extremely important to remember that this movie is the 'cat's pyjamas', and will probably go in for an Oscar or two if the academy don't act like idiots (again). Bane is one of the best written, most quotable character's of any film I've ever seen, and Bale really comes into his own as both Batman and Bruce in this third and final instalment (he tones down the Batman grumble, and doesn't make Bruce look like such a pansy anymore). So really disregard what I've said above, it's a fantastic film and I'm sure it will be a lot of people's favourite of the trilogy, just not mine. Go out and make your own opinion on it, because it's another of these films that come around once in a while where a review or general rating isn't able to truly determine how great it really is. (9/10)"
"I was really excited to see this movie, more so than any other movie this summer. After watching it this afternoon, I have to say I was underwhelmed. While I thought the cinematography was quite dramatic, with Pittsburgh and Jodhpur, India providing dramatic scenery, some of the story lines fell flat. Comparing this film the Nolan's last two films, the Dark Knight and Inception, it feels like the story just wasn't as well written. The twists we're OK, nothing mindblowing, and there were a few holes in the plot. But I think it really just came down to the Villains in the movie. What made Dark Knight so great was that The Joker was such a great character. Bane? Not so much. He was strong and punched hard, but wasn't quite evil enough. I expected more."
"I'm from the Netherlands and we Dutch people are quite down-to-earth. If we watch a comedy we nod approvingly if a joke is funny, if we're watching a drama we nod disapprovingly if something bad happens. In short, Dutch people aren't generally very enthusiastic. At the end of the Dark Knight Rises, however, there was applause. No kidding, actual applause. I had never seen this happen, ever. And it's not undeserved, because this is one amazing piece of cinema.

There might be some minor flaws in this film. Bane's voice sounded a bit odd at times, for instance. But then, no good movie is without mistakes. There's Pterodactyls in Citizen Kane, for god's sake! Look over the movies slight flaws and there's an amazing film underneath.

The story is compelling and much less ""superhero"" than the other two. Sure, you still have the typical comic-book characters. But the story's focus on the people behind those masks creates a much more realistic and emotionally compelling movie. And the movie achieves this without going too far away from the Batman's comic-book roots.

But there's another reason why this movie is such a great film. It complete's the trilogy. It rarely happens that movies based on comic-books contain an actual ending. This movie does, taking all the threads from the three movies and wrapping them up in a neat bundle.

In conclusion, it might be an unpopular opinion, but I find this to be the best Batman movie, ever."
"I have just seen this movie and was deeply disappointed. I think this is the worst movie I have seen in years. I really liked the previous film ""The dark knight"" with Heath Ledger in a fantastic role as the joker, but this film !? Why not rename it ""The dark knight s"". The messy plot, all the logical faults, the soft comments where to sacrifice oneself for the city of Gotham, the tears, the worn out wisdom of the wise-man in the cave. I suspect a ""we're only in it for the money"" attitude for the creators of this film, but then again it looks as if they tried but failed, and an expensive film to make it must have been. Why not use some of that money on an intelligent plot. Instead of this mess. Just forget this movie and save your money, and your time."
"I went to see the midnight showing that had the longest line for a film I've ever seen, and The Dark Knight Rises was beyond well worth the time I waited in line which was nearly three hours. The Dark Knight Rises is an achievement of film that hasn't been done in well in film in years and you will be reminded of great films like back to films like Lawrence of Arabia, Ben-Hur and Seven Samurai in their story, message, grandeur and scope. It's a rarity to see a film attempt it now days let alone be successful, and The Dark Knight Rises it that kind of film that everyone should see. The film is more than an event film or summer movie. The Dark Knight Rises is simply one of the best movies of all time.

I've never been a big fan of DC comics never really getting into or finding a connection with their characters, but Batman was the exception. I loved the dark tone of the comic and the villains along with the more adult story lines it became one of my favorite comics outside of Spiderman, and the X-Men. Since Batman's conception in 1939 Batman has become one of the oldest comic book characters and one of the most popular, and there have been many TV and film adaptations, and most of them I've seen have been surprisingly good. From Adam West's fun but campy late 1960's version to Super Friends, to the best television Batman in Batman: The Animated Series, to Batman and Batman Begins and Batman: Mask of the Phantasm. There have been many different takes on Batman, but Christopher Nolan's is the best surpassing my favorite Batman film Mask of the Phantasm. What Nolan has achieved here with the Dark Knight Rises and his trilogy of films is truly something special, but I get to that and the director later.

As for The Dark Knight Rises let me get to what I like first, which was everything. I'll address some of the issues some of the critics had later. The story I can't go into too much detail, because it will give away some plot points and there are a few brilliant twists in the movie including the amazing and satisfying ending. The Dark Knight Rises takes place eight years after the end of The Dark Knight. The crime in Gotham has gone way done, because of the Dent Act, which gave more power to the police. Bruce Wayne has disappeared from the public eye hiding in his mansion as a recluse living in his self-pity. He's brought out of his hiding by Selina Kyle and a mysterious Bane who brings death and destruction everywhere he goes. There really isn't much mention to The Dark Knight in the plot of the film or the Joker, and you won't notice that. The Dark Knight Rises does have many connections to Batman begins as Batman's story comes full circle. I'll stop here before I give anything away. I will say that the plot written by Christopher and Jonathan Nolan is well written in story, pace and tone.

Michael Caine is truly a superb actor and he truly wait he had better get a supporting Oscar for this film and he should win it. He is superb as Alfred and has been in the previous two films. Bring such emotion and humor as Bruce's butler, father figure and friend. He wants the best for Bruce just like any parent wants the best for their children. Another old timer who steals many of the scenes of the film is the great Gary Oldman as James Gordon. I again think he should at very least be nominated for supporting actor. Christian Bale again does great job as Bruce Wayne and a good job as Batman. Unlike the other actors who've taken on the role I think he's done the best job getting into the mind of Bruce Wayne and totally embodying the character. There are many new comers to the film. I like I think many people were a little worried about Bain played by Tom Hardy. Tom did a great job. I know people want to compare Bane to the Joker and Heath Ledger, so I will. Tom Hardy made a more vicious bad guy, but is less charismatic, which Ledger embodied in the Joker. They are two different types of villains. I wasn't as upset like most after seeing the Catwoman suit months ago. I was more upset that Anne Hathaway was cast for the part. I thought she was an overrated actress, plus I was honestly hoping for a hotter actress. My doubts were alleviated as the film drew closer and I saw that she could fill out a cat suit. Out of all the new comers to this film series I think she might have done the best job. She brought sexiness and emotion to the character and to be honest I thought she's a better Catwoman then Michelle Pheiffer. Next is Joseph Gordon-Levitt as John Blake.

I don't know why IMDb doesn't let you post reviews with more then a thousand words. Anyway you can see the rest of my review at Movieweb.com under Huntsman."
"If there was anyone who could top 'The Dark Knight', it would have to be Christopher Nolan himself. It's no small feat even for the masterful director - not least for the fact that it would have been difficult to construct a villain as perfect as the late Heath Ledger's Joker – but fans who ever doubted if Nolan would be able to pull it off can now rest easy. Not only is the answer to that question an affirmative yes, Nolan closes quite possibly the very best comic-book adaptation ever with a heart-stopping bang, once and for all putting his stamp on the Batman legend with a viscerally thrilling and emotionally gripping conclusion.

Familiarity with the Gotham universe and the Bruce Wayne/ Batman character that Nolan had built over the course of 'Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight' is a must if one were to truly appreciate and admire the subtleties, nuances and brilliance of this trilogy capper.

Opening eight years after Batman disappeared into the shadows carrying the burden of District Attorney Harvey Dent's murder, Nolan and his co- screenwriter Johnathan Nolan paint a Gotham still living a lie. While Dent's legacy has assisted the city to lock up its criminals without trial, the seeds of criminalism are evident- after all, Gotham has once again been divided by class, with the wealthy controlling the institutions of power and the poor forced to grovel in the sewers. Those who recall 'Batman Begins' will certainly draw the parallels with Gotham before Batman's appearance, the very societal malaise perfect fodder for Ra's al Ghul and his League of Shadows' plan of destruction then.

Of course, the similarities are no coincidence- Batman's adversary here is the vicious mercenary Bane (Tom Hardy), who was a student of the League of Shadows before he was ex-communicated from the organisation for being even too extremist for them. Sure, Bane may not be as familiar a villain within the Batman universe as the Joker, but a sensationally exhilarating mid-air hijack sequence will soon demonstrate that Bane isn't kidding when he proclaims himself as 'Gotham's reckoning'. Not only an intellectual equal to Batman, Bane is also physically superior, especially given Bruce's poor state of health following his self-imposed seclusion in the eight years that have followed.

Bane's strategy of upending the class inequality will intrigue and delight the more cerebral viewers, while his physicality will excite the adrenaline-driven (and predominantly male) viewer looking for some good- old mano-a-mano action goodness. Herein lies the genius of Nolan's films- built as they may be for blockbuster spectacle, they have always had an intellectual slant. The realities of our capitalist societies have been distilled and crystallised into that of Gotham, and the triggers of class warfare laid bare for our reflection.

Even as it feels expansive in scope, Nolan never loses sight of his titular character. This is by far his most intimate take on Bruce Wayne/ Batman, returning full circle to examine Wayne's motivations for adopting the alter-ego in the first place as well as his inner demons. In particular, Nolan reinforces the relationship between Batman and his two guardians- the loyal Wayne family butler Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Caine) and the equally loyal Wayne Enterprises employee Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman).

Besides casting light on Wayne's troubled soul, Nolan also delves once again into the core of the Batman legend. He established Batman as a symbol of hope and justice before, and here he powerfully reaffirms that notion of the caped crusader as a beacon of promise and perseverance amidst a fallen world. 'The Batman can be anyone', says Bruce Wayne in the movie- and Nolan leaves that statement ringing in your mind with a franchise feeder of an ending and a nifty twist to one of the key new characters he adds.

Whether returning or new characters, all but Anne Hathaway have worked with Nolan previously, and every one of these fine actors are in top form here. Hathaway's zestful performance brings some welcome levity into the otherwise grim and brooding proceedings, and Levitt perfectly embodies the balance of optimism and pragmatism of his character. As Bane, Tom Hardy is unfortunately saddled with the bane (pun intended) of following in the shoes of Heath Ledger- and though he never manages to make his character quite as iconic, he is nevertheless a fearsome and formidable physical presence on screen. Veteran actors Gary Oldman (as Commissioner Gordon), Freeman and Caine are excellent as always, but it is Bale who carries the show with a thoroughly committed, haunting and hypnotic portrayal of Bruce Wayne.

Mesmerising too is Nolan's handling of the action scenes in the movie, most of which are filmed with IMAX cameras and look absolutely stunning in the format. From the opening skyjacking to blowing up a football field in the middle of a packed stadium to a daring mid-day raid on the Stock Exchange, Nolan spares nothing in ensuring that the action is consistently riveting. It is also never less than realistic, a quality that Nolan has managed to sustain through every one of his Batman films. And together with his regular d.p. Wally Pfister, Nolan creates a scarily authentic portrait of urban warfare complete with the collapse of physical and social structures.

Indeed, as one looks back at Nolan's trilogy, one can only marvel at how he has managed to make the Batman universe so relevant and prescient to our real world. Unlike the Marvel movies which has kept the comic book universe intact while injecting real-world elements, Nolan has so beautifully integrated the twin universes together, sacrificing neither the legend from the books nor the realities of today's society. 'The Dark Knight Rises' is an epic conclusion all right, packed with action, emotion, depth and symbolism, and a must-see simply because it is one of the very best films of the year."
"I saw ""The Dark Knight Rises"" yesterday evening and it completely exceeded my every expectation. When i first saw ""Begins"" i thought that it took the comic book films to a different level thanks to the believability and sincerity of the characters it portrayed. ""Rises"" continues this line which was set by the first movie and followed by ""The Dark Knight"".

The cast couldn't have been more perfect. Bale as Batman is able to give genuine emotion and bitterness following the losses he has suffered. He is not just another hero, he has been scarred by the events come to pass and knows that just putting up the mask again is not going to be enough.

Bane, played by Tom Hardy, stole the show for me. I was pleased that a new kind of villain was introduced. In the first movie, Scarecrow and Ra's Al Ghul relied on the terror of fear implanted in peoples minds, in the second one, Joker unleashed uncontrollable chaos and in the third one Bane is a brutal menace, who breaks down Batman and, by his words ""liberates people from the oppressive corruption Gotham endures"". Tom Hardy did remarkably well by creating Bane as someone terrifying simply by using his voice and eyes.

I was also glad to see that Joseph Gordon-Levitt had a great role following his ""Inception"" one. He plays a different kind of hero and this performance definitely feels like he will have a lot that comes in his way in next years. Anne Hathaway was also phenomenal as Selina Kyle. She had the main female part and did an excellent and believable job.

The rest of the supporting cast consisted of great actors and actresses too. Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Marion Cotillard and Gary Oldman were all marvelous in their respective roles. The chemistry between the whole cast was amazing, maybe it's the main reason why Nolan has included them in most of his films too.

Other aspects of the film were completely mind-blowing. Hans Zimmer wrote score of immense atmosphere, the scale of action scenes was extraordinary and cinematography beyond ones imagination. Dialogue was smart and really gave life to the characters.

In conclusion, i have to say that the Batman trilogy Nolan has created is one of my favorites and ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a worthy final chapter to it. Everything about this movie is shear perfect."
"This, in a word, was a masterpiece. It completely wrapped up the loose ends of Nolan's Batman movies in an extremely satisfying and epic way, while still leaving it open in a way. The acting was top notch, Tom Hardy did a phenomenal job as Bane.Bane was an excellent villain. He was hard and menacing yet much more human than the Joker, and one scene in particular you see Bane is still has a little bit of a soft side. The effects and cinematography were just what you'd expect, perfect. I honestly don't have any complaints with this film. It was everything I hoped for, and made this, in my mind, on of the greatest trilogy of all time. The movie was paced just write slowly building to a edge of the seat peak, and the end left a smile on your face. It was perfect 10/10."
"There were a lot of batman movies, but none of them could meet the expectations created by the comics, with ""batman & Robin"" being one of the most horrible movies I've ever seen! Then Nolan came along with a bunch of masterpieces behind him, and then created two astounding batman films within a span of 3 years! And now, he has concluded, which to me is one of the best trilogies ever, in an epic and a heart-stopping way! As they say 'THE LEGEND ENDS, BUT THE LEGACY CONTINUES'............!!!

Its hard to compare this and TDK, both of them are amusing in their own prospective. TDK was run mainly by joker, aka heath ledger, and this was clearly batman's show. I can't imagine a perfect way to end the trilogy. And Nolan did an amazing job in maintaining the fire created by TDK, clearly stating that he is one of the best in his genre.

The action sequences were pretty amazing so was the background music. There is a reason why Nolan retained the same cast for all the movies, and they did it professionally.

It was one hell of a ride for me, and gave me goosebumps throughout. Being a batman fan, I loved all the 3 movies, and just like the other two movies, I rate it 10/10. Don't miss it guys, besides you have got to see the 'legend end'."
"This movie is AMAZING! I am planning on watching it on the opening day again after I watched the Premiere. The conclusion of the Dark Night sequel is perfect. The acting was also Terrific and this got to be the number one movie of 2012 so far for me. It is definitely worth to watch and I promise it is not going to waste the 3 hours of your life! There is a perfect balance of story line, theme, action, romance, and drama in the film though I've got to admit I cried a couple of times in some scenes of the movie. There is definitely not going to be a sequel of this movie but there is going to be another story from it. Again, this movie (and of course its sequel) has got to be the best Superhero movie of all time! Bat Man is a human and superhero role model. Great job on this movie Dark Night team!"
"Luckily for me, I got to see the premiere of this masterpiece around 3 days before the rest of the world. I had been looking forward to Rises ever since I heard the last words in The Dark Knight and let me tell you, it was well worth the wait. The plot was well thought out and the acting was superb, however with that said the acting was not close to that of Heath Ledger's spectacular performance in The Dark Knight. It was the perfect end to an incredible trilogy, Nolan has well earned a spot on my list of favorite directors. The only reason I gave this movie a 9/10 is because I do not believe that any film to date is ""perfect"", but the Dark Knight trilogy comes pretty damn close to it."
"As ""The Dark Knight Rises"" opens - picking up eight years after the events chronicled in ""The Dark Knight"" - we find eccentric billionaire Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) in a rather depressed state of mind. He has essentially withdrawn from the world, given up his crime-fighting ways and hung up his Batman cape, having largely fallen out of favor with the citizens of Gotham City who see him less as a hero and more as an out-of-control killer. Only his loyal servant/father-figure, Albert (the venerable Michael Caine), cares enough to give him a swift kick in the rear-end every now and again to try to get him to move on with his life. All this changes, however, when the fascistic Bane comes to town, a figure so consummate in his villainy that he is willing to blow up the whole blasted metropolis with an atomic bomb if he doesn't get what he wants.

Though Christopher Nolan's latest entry in the series is nowhere near as engaging or as gripping as the previous two (especially the second), the movie attains a certain historical and contemporary significance with its echoes of both the French Revolution and Occupy Wall Street, though, oddly, the movie seems intent on putting us on the wrong side of history in both cases (rooting for a corrupt status quo and against a grass-roots uprising against that corruption).

And, let's face it, Heath Ledger's Joker - one of the richest villains in all of movie history - would be a hard act for anyone to follow, and Tom Hardy's Bane, even with his mask and amplified voice, seems a mite tame in comparison. On his own terms, however, Bane is reasonably effective, if only because of the implacable nature of his evil, which manifests itself in his willingness to sacrifice masses of innocent people to enrich his own power.

Thanks partly to the muddled politics and partly to the overstuffed nature of the storytelling, the movie never finds a way to fully engage its audience in the world it's created. In fact, in comparison to the narrative sturdiness of its two predecessors, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" comes across as a bit of a messy affair overall, with subplots spinning off in all directions, with little gravity at the core to bind it all together. A case in point: while Anne Hathaway brings a degree of flirtatious charm to the role of cat burglar-turned-Cat Woman, the character as a whole seems like an afterthought, tacked onto the story to provide some counter-balancing romantic interludes for the sullen, all but monastic Wayne.

The cast is rounded out by Gary Oldman, Marion Cotillard, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Aaron Eckhart and others, but, more so than in the two previous entries in the series, the real stars of ""The Dark Night Rises"" turn out to be the visual pyrotechnics and special effects."
"So is The Dark Knight Rises better than The Dark Knight? If you were one of those fans who prefer Batman Begins to TDK then you'll find much to love about TDKR. And if you weren't then no Batman film will ever match TDK for you. (SPOLIER ALERT)And yes, it is The End, a resounding resolution for what Batman Begins begun. Threads from that film are picked up, lengthened and strengthened, bringing a staunch integrity – in every sense – to the overall arc. Is it perfect? Factor in some clunky catch-up exposition near the start, a cringey log-fire love scene and moments where Hans Zimmer's score nearly foghorns the actors off the screen and the answer's no. An even bigger question: is it up there with The Dark Knight? Not quite."
"This has, honestly, got to be one of the best films of all time. Whereas Batman Begins was a David and Goliath story, The Dark Knight was a duel, then TDKR is war. This film is a brutal, deep, thoughtful,touching, tale of redemption and destruction. The cast is superb but the standout is Joseph Gordon Levitt as a rookie cop who is ahead of the game. Although Tom Hardy gives him a run for his money as a re-imagined Bane, a terrorist that truly believes in a cause, rather than just anarchy, and that makes him truly terrifying. Even Anne Hathaway brought her game as Selina Kyle who acts whatever part she needs to. Everyone should see this film, although I will warn you that the violence in it is extreme for the rating and really pushes what you can do in a film of this classification"
"First things first, don't watch the Rises without watching the Begins. You will surely miss the heart and soul of the movie.

This movie is not about the action, the conflict, the villain or the hero. Nolan returns to the roots of this series by making Bruce learn more about fear. Bruce must learn the power of fear yet again, see it in a new way and learn to use it in a different way.

The expected things are all there, the villain winning the first battle, hero returning stronger, nice twists, action and fist fights, new gadgets, effects. But don't let them blind you, look deeper and you would find the crowning jewel of this series.

Another thing worth mentioning, the soundtrack is amazing!!"
"Christopher Nolan is becoming a modern day Stanley Kubrick. However Nolan needs to do more films for that to be seen more fully and of course Kubrick was Kubrick, he was untouchable with his films. Nonetheless, Nolan is very detailed/meticulous/precise with everything in his films, from the smallest thing to the most important thing in the film, just like Kubrick.

Nolan knows how important good sound, good sound editing and a great music score can be in bringing the film from good to great. I would say 8 times out of 10 if a film has everything going for it, but has a lousy music score, it will be a good film, but not great. And same goes if the film has a great music score, but it's missing good directing or good acting, just some element. The opening scenes in The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises are great and fun scenes to watch over and over again because of the great music score that's going along with the scene. Plus the music score in those opening scenes makes the stakes that much more important. The music score goes with a film like peanut butter and jelly, like a cigarette with an adult beverage.

I'm not sure, but it looks as if Nolan doesn't use any CGI in the Batman films either, which makes it more of a long film process for Nolan but at the same time it makes for a better movie too because Nolan is not sloppy or lazy with his action sequences, again, he's very meticulous with everything.

CGI in ways has made the process quicker for filmmakers, but at the same time it's made it easy for the filmmakers to get sloppy and lazy and mass produce crap like the Transformer Movies or The Avengers. And yes, I did not like The Avengers, it's like every other mass produced action film, it's sloppy. But Nolan with his Batman movies, the action is very detailed and there's nothing sloppy about the action or the movie as a whole, and that's because Nolan isn't concerned with mass producing something for monetary value, he's concerned with making a quality film.

Another thing Nolan does, if you ever notice, each main character from all the Batman movies has their own theme music. The Scarecrow had his, the Joker had his, and Bane has his. Batman has his of course as well. But for a director to give each bad guy their own theme music, that takes careful planning and a lot of patience. Most directors don't have that kind of patience these days, except for the greats such as Spielberg and Scorsese.

A big theme from all the Batman movies by Nolan, is 'rising'. From Bruce Wayne having memories of his Dad saying ""Why do we fall, so we can learn to pick ourselves up again."" to the Rising out of the prison in The Dark Knight Rises, it's a continuing theme about rising. Nolan is brilliant in his writing in this sense.

Bruce Wayne learns(in all the Batman movies by Nolan) what a recovering addict of alcohol or drugs learns, which is everything in life isn't an all or nothing thing, it's not an event, it's an on-going process and it truly is a journey. You need help from people as you can't do it all by yourself. Bruce Wayne as Batman may get all the glory, but he always gets and has help to get there.

Bane at one point in the movie says to Batman ""Victory has defeated you."" Meaning, everything has become an event for Batman now, unimportant, and Batman is kind of like how Rocky Balboa was in Rocky 3 at this point against his first meeting with Bane, which is he's not careful or afraid anymore, he doesn't look at all the factors or variables anymore, he's cocky in his apathy.

Bruce Wayne has to learn again that it's a process, that it's always been a process and to truly be happy with what he wants and needs in life he needs to be aware of this fact again. Which he eventually becomes aware of again, and ultimately finds happiness because of this fact.

Just an all around great movie though, terrific action, great directing and writing, Tom Hardy as Bane is spectacular, what a great and fun actor he is to watch as well as Christian Bale as Batman and Gary Oldman as the Commissioner. A very fun movie to watch over and over with some deep meaning behind everything that is going on from beginning to end. Also a terrific performance from Anne Hathaway as Catwoman, she really pulls this part off well, very well in fact, I was very impressed with her. See this movie if you haven't yet!"
"I would describe this movie as a great production with great directing and a terrific cast where in my opinion everyone put in great work. I am not gonna spoil anything specific from the movie but just say that its obviously a huge production with great talent behind it and a very worthy third movie by the today legendary Christopher Nolan. It is in my opinion a great movie and lives up to the huge hype witch in itself is an amazing achievement. The movie will be seen by all previous fans and you should see it but I can not agree that this is The Dark Nights finest movie even after all the great work put in and with all the great scenes combined with the best of effects with this huge budget. I consider this movie a great one but far from my top five and even this great movie in the Batman category would be behind ""The Dark Knight"" but as u know, that certainly doesn't mean it couldn't be great. Go and see it!"
"In the long build-up to this film, I started to believe it would surpass The Dark Knight. But it did not. However, it was a fulfilling ending. The fact that Nolan's reboot of the Batman franchise had an official ending was fulfilling enough itself, simply because it gave the Batman a purpose.

Bale was once again a great Bruce Wayne/Batman. Sadly, Michael Caine as Alfred played a much smaller role than he has done in the last two films. However, we saw Alfred Pennyworth at his most profound in this film which was, despite being very emotional, a great feature.

Tom Hardy was the perfect actor for the role of Bane. And Bane was he perfect villain for the final instalment of Nolan's trilogy. We finally see someone who can match Batman both mentally and, more importantly, physically. A couple of lines of his were a bit muffled and hard to hear, but that has no effect on the film and its plot. The inclusion of Selina Kyle, or unofficially ""Catwoman"" was also great feature. While characters such as that do run the risk of bringing a more 'comic-book feel' to the film (something which the absence of has made Nolan's films much better), her character worked well with the story and Anne Hathaway was great in the role.

Now, onto the film itself. If you go into this film expecting it to blow the Dark Knight out of the water, you're going to be disappointed. TDK managed to feature so many great scenes and all with so much depth within the same time frame as TDKR. This film, however, seemed to be a bit rushed. Not in the sense that it lacks quality in aspects such as acting or directing, but mainly due to the film trying to cover too much time in too little film time. Emotional parts of the film are over too quickly. A few aspects are also left unanswered in the film, too.

On a more positive note, though, the film is packed with great action, special effects, twists, and emotion throughout, with bits of humour in between. Nolan does not disappoint. Nor do any of the actors in their roles.

All in all, TDKR was a fulfilling end to Nolan's Batman trilogy. However, a lot of the film seemed rushed and some, perhaps trivial, parts of the film are left to assumption. While the acting was by no means bad, it is unlikely that it will sweep any awards shows. The special effects, on the other hand, will be where the film competes with the other blockbusters this year in terms of awards.

Regardless of how this film compares to the previous two films in your opinion, The Dark Knight Rises is a film you will certainly be able to watch over and over again."
"The Dark Knight Rises is an exceptional film without a shadow of a doubt. The acting, plot, direction, score and story telling are all top notch. Now I want to get this out of the way as soon as possible, a lot of people are comparing Bane to the Joker but you cannot do this, simply on the soul fact... they are completely different characters. The Joker was dark, cunning and knew how to manipulate those we all thought couldn't be, however Bane is without a doubt Batman's strongest opponent physically and mentally, he pushes Bruce Wayne/Batman to the brink of destruction throughout the movie, his physical presence in itself is extremely intimidating not to mention his distinctive voice. There are a lot of plot twists also throughout the movie which fit brilliantly within the story telling and the last 40 minutes are one of the greatest in cinematic history. I don't want to say much more because words simply can't describe how brilliant this movie is and in my opinion beats TDK and I never thought I would say that because TDK is a cinematic triumph across the board. All that's left to say now is thank you Mr. Nolan for a truly wonderful trilogy that concluded in epic style."
"I know most people did not like how bane was played or portrayed, but I loved him as a villain. I actually loved the voice that Nolan gave him. To me he was a menacing and impactful villain in the movie. I also thought the plot by Miranda Tate was exceptional. It was devious and deceiving, while deceptively cunning. Sure there was things that Nolan could have done without (the kiss scene between batman and catwoman), but the overall vision for Batman was exceptional. I also like that he left the possibility open for future movies featuring Robin! I loved the original batman with Michael Keaton, but the following batman movies left a sour taste in my mouth."
"Batman (Christian Bale) comes out of self-imposed retirement to defeat terrorist Bane (Tom Hardy) who has taken over Gotham City.

The CGI and other stunts were nothing short of fantastic and almost unbelievable. Kudos. The acting performances all around are good, although there are times the dialogues were difficult to hear clearly. The music was very good, yet haunting.

I like this but it was too long. I liked this but was made to feel very uncomfortable when Bane takes over Gotham. I felt I was part of the Gotham citizenry living in total anarchy, and I couldn't see any way out. Bane imprisons most of the police force in the sewers of Gotham and closes the openings via explosions; he also creates, via explosions, deep holes in the football field and takes over Gotham in the guise of giving the people their freedoms.

I liked this but Batman is in a deep prison cell after Bane defeats him and the only way out is to rock-climb a long circular wall to freedom. I liked this, but I don't like to see my superheroes become too human. I liked this but it was too dark.

But mostly, I liked this knowing the Dark Knight would make things right. Isn't that why we go to the movies and stay to the end? In most cases staying to the end resolves many questions we have during the show, but here at THIS end, we still have questions.

Is the Dark Knight dead and that ends the trilogy? Do we see the emergence of Robin to fight crime? Will Robin fight alone? Does everyone now know Bruce Wayne is or was Batman? At the end, does Alfred (Michael Caine) really see what we see him seeing or is it just wishful thinking? Is Batman really dead?

Stay tuned to this Bat Channel to see what Christopher Nolen, the Director, comes up with next (9/10)

Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No."
"Careful as I have been over the past few days to avoid all contact with outside world, should someone/thing reveal plot points in the movie and spoil the experience, I still ended up looking at a few news articles that mentioned that ""critics"" found the movie as an ""epic letdown"". Well, I've now seen the movie and I just don't see what those guys are talking about. The movie's awesome, more so when you watch it in IMAX. The story, locales, the special effects, background score, dialogues, acting - everything comes together perfectly and the almost-3-hours go past in a whiz. We get to see more of Bruce Wayne than Batman (though not as much as in ""Batman Begins"") and Christian Bale does give a nice performance. Same goes for the others too (though as charming as Anne Hathaway appeared in all her scenes, I'd have preferred seeing the gorgeous self of Selina Kyle in non-black-dresses too).

One sore point was Bane's voice. The garbled-speech pattern in his ""voice"" was little unsettling and at times the background score would drown his dialogues out. Just like Batman's voice in ""The Dark Knight"", this was disappointing. The dialogues, at certain times, would appear a little contrived and not ""fit"" the scene. In all honesty, the movie wasn't as good as TDK, but it was close. And a part of the reason behind it is that in TDKR, the villain is not as enigmatic as The Joker. Tom Hardy does give a good performance as Bane, but there is only so much you can act with just your eyes and half your face in a mask.

Many have felt that the ending could've been better. I, on the contrary, felt that the ending was the most appropriate end that the trilogy could've had. All said and done, there is no doubt that the movie is right up there with the rest of Chris Nolan's movies and he continues to dazzle the viewers with his brilliance."
"It was never really a question of whether the third and final act in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy would be good. Nolan doesn't make lousy films – and even at their most critically divisive (Inception comes to mind), he uses filmier techniques and spectacle that leave most Hollywood epics in the dust, heads spinning. So, no – 'The Dark Knight Rises' was always assured some degree of quality. But just how much are we talking here? A brief word on the story – spoiler- free as always. You'll want to go back and re-watch Batman Begins before heading to The Dark Knight Rises. It, arguably more than the Joker-focused sequel, has more to do with the unfolding events in the closing chapter than you might expect. Nolan sets this entry up to really validate his Batman films as a true trilogy, linking together characters and excerpts from the first two films, recapping the key points with well-edited care, and managing to land this character- heavy, expository behemoth with a steady hand. This is an achievement on par with the greatest film trilogies of the 20 and 21 centuries – no exaggeration"
"After the Dark Knight was released I couldn't avoid the hype that surrounded it and decided to give the two first movies a watch. I thought both movies were okay but not spectacular, apart from the memorable Joker. The thing is, i can't just name exactly what caused it but both movies just bored me a bit. I think this feeling is caused mainly because the world of Gotham doesn't get a lot of attention. Sure, we see skyscrapers, Batman's mansion and an occasional location for a fighting scene but it isn't enough, it makes the city feel like a cardboard background, which for me just kills the atmosphere and chance to immerse myself in this fictional world. Besides this, i like Christian Bale in most movies but as Batman...he just can't convince me! The fact that he changes his voice when being Batman doesn't help, it just sounds silly.

But okay, I was entertained enough to watch the close of the trilogy and i must say, it was the best movie of the three. Bane is an awesome bad guy and the movies has some 'big moments' (that collapsing stadium!) that shocked me. My biggest complaint is that the pace of the movie slows down considerably after the stadium scene. It seems that after Bane conquers Gotham he just does NOTHING! Then it is just a matter of time before Batman saves the day. The ending was cool though but again...this trilogy just isn't for me. In most cases i can understand/share the love for a movie/trilogy but here it seems i am living in a different dimension, a dimension in where i think Gotham should be portrayed as a vivid but grimy city, with things like crazy nightlife filled with shady characters and a Batman who talks like Batman..even when he is off duty."
"In 2005, Christopher Nolan took it upon his shoulders to completely erase the horror that was Batman & Robin.

Today, as his trilogy is complete, heads are bowed before the man who not only redeemed the Legend, but took him to new heights.

To compare TDKR to any of the previous parts is as wrong as it is to compare it with Tim Burton's run on Batman, as wrong as trying to compare it with Knightfall, as wrong as comparing it with anything in this world! TDKR towers and triumphs as a fitting finale to the Gotham City that was personally created by the Nolan Brothers.

Yes, it does have its flaws, most notably being that Batman is and always will be the ""World's Greatest Detective"" and TDKR pays little heed to that aspect.

Yes, as a stand-alone film, the plot line does become too heavy to carry its own weight towards the latter half.

And Yes, it does leave a myriad of questions unanswered.

But, does it create an all-new tale of the Caped Crusader? One that will be devoured by fans over and over again? HELL YES! Each frame is packed with powerhouse performance pieces, be it Christian Bale's vulnerable Bruce Wayne or Anne Hathway's sexually charged Selina Kyle. Tom Hardy creates a truly menacing Bane – using only his eyes to convey so much. Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate plays her character to the hilt and the real surprise of the film is Joseph-Gordon Levitt as Officer Blake, who storms through the film, portraying an officer of Gotham PD with true aplomb.

Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine have been superb since the first part and they only push themselves further in TDKR, as does Hans Zimmerman with his outstanding score.

But the true stars of this film, as well as the entire trilogy are the Nolan Brothers who lovingly created this realistic Gotham, who took us on a journey from a young and angry Bruce Wayne to an aging and suicidal one, who pushed each building block of the foundations they had created in 2005 and who lulled the viewers into a false sense of victory and then brought them down like a house of cards, who hoisted them up one moment and broke their backs the other.

In TDKR, the Nolan Brothers bring forth the vulnerability of Bruce Wayne to the forefront, pitting him against Bane, a mercenary with no fear, trying to break the spirit of Bruce and to an extent, succeeding even.

It's a tale of good v/s evil, of might v/s right, of conscience v/s external influences.

It's a tale that is multi-layered, multi-faceted and a delight at multiple levels.

It's a tale, that shall soon not be forgot."
"I expected a technological and moral extravaganza, evil Bane, mighty Bruce and sexy women. I got all of that and more. However, the extra I got from the quality of the special effects, the design of the weird flying or road machines and the actors play I lost on the plot.

They have tried so hard to make it more that they made something different. Yes, Batman is a workaholic in disguise, obsessed of saving the city of Gotham, yes, Morgan Freeman knows all and, yes, in the end good prevails in a dark world. We already knew that when we started watching the film. All the extra stuff they've put in was just spam. The legend of the Pit, the megalomaniac threat to the city, the people that just stay put because they have no bridge, the ridiculous fighting scenes when Batman is either too weak or too strong and he doesn't use any of the tech to actually help him win the fight, all of these made it feel like I was watching a bad movie blown up to gigantic proportions.

The actors. I liked Tom Hardy in the fighter and he made this film, as well. He is clearly a talented actor and this is his rise (see what I did there?). Christian Bale was almost not present in the film. He smiled a little, then cried a little, did some pushups and got screwed by every woman he met. Anne Hathaway has a rather hard to buy role, but she was more than OK and helped make the film seem more complex than it actually was. Gary Oldman was useful, but not really doing anything complicated. As for the others in the full cast of the film, they barely registered.

Bottom line: the entire plot is based on characters from the previous movies by Nolan. You should refresh your memory on those before you watch it. The feeling of the film is impressive because they tried very hard to make it so, but all the cool scenes you can watch in the trailer and the rest is a convoluted plot that doesn't make a lot of sense. The film is redeemed by the great quality of its making, meaning well spent big budget, and of the actors play. All in all, an average movie, but fun nevertheless. Oh, and Robin doesn't suck."
"After reading so many good reviews I was expecting a lot more from this movie. The time line is completely screwed, events even more impossible than any other super hero or even science fiction movie I've seen lately and I can't count the number of times I thought ""Oh come on!.. that's just ridiculous"".

Certainly there are nice images and interesting characters but the story sucks so much it made the movie absolutely boring and ridiculous to me.

I was not a fan of the previous Batman movies but at least I found something interesting the first 2 movies of this trilogy. This is more like a science fiction movie and nothing like the other movies which were a lot more realistic and close to my idea of what Batman should be like."
"I won't even compare 'The Dark Knight Rises' with 'The Dark Knight', simply because there's no need to compare them.

Instead I'd like to focus on the greatness achieved with this movie. I have to admit, there are some flaws. But every movie has them. Every. And even though it has its flaws, this movie, in its entirety with its message and amazingly realistic trilogy-storyline, is without doubt a masterpiece we will all talk about years after.

It's just unbelievably beautiful to see that there are still movies that make people watch them in theaters. Even though very bad, shocking things happened that are associated with it, even though people lost their lives making the movie and watching the movie. Even though many things did not turn out how you could've thought they would turn out, this trilogy has found its way in our culture, making people want to see it no matter what happened, by taking us on a very emotional travel in which we all can find our consolation, our will, our bravery."
"Look, don't sit here reading this. Go out and watch it. Now. You won't be disappointed, I promise. As IMDb requires ten lines, I have to make an effort to at least recommend it. It's electrifying. Hardy and Hatheway are amazing. Everything leads up to this climatic ending which is stunning. Although not as amazing as The Dark Knight, this comes off feeling almost as strong because of its visually astonishing set pieces and deafening score by the dependable Hans Zimmer. The lack of CGI only adds to the believability. I'm excited to be growing up in a day and age where a movie about a costumed bat running around beating up bad guys can be considered as one of the most influential films of all time. And it is. It truly is. Look, you know you're going to see it. Leave Avengers lying in the dust with a mere 1 billion and lets see this movie make several billions. P.S Australia rules, we get it a day early :)"
"The Dark Knight Rises is not only the greatest third entry into The Dark Knight trilogy but its the greatest third outing for any trilogy. The director went all out on this one and it payed off. The film introduces us to a 'rusty' Batman who goes into hiding but as the mysterious Catwoman and the terrifying Bane, so Batman must 'rise' up and protect Gotham City. The directing in this film is the 'best' i have seen ever. The writing is absolutely perfect, the story rounds out the trilogy like a masterpiece, the characters are so well written and invested into the story, they are played by some of the greatest actors of all time and they did an awesome job some of them need Oscar nods. The ending is so powerful and so emotional that i was bawling, this is a war film but at the very heart of the story is an emotional, powerful, action, drama film, which has been done to perfection. I saw this at the midnight release and it was worth it! Amazing in every aspect, the film does not feel like t goes for 2 45 minutes, it goes so fast but thats what a good movie should do and i am not just saying this because i am a 'batman' fan or a 'christopher Nolan' fan but seriously, everyone needs to see this. You will love it!! It was worth the wait and now Christopher Nolan is now one of my favorite writers and directors, the film deserves best picture!!! Loved every second of it!! 5/5"
"WOW strap yourself in this is going to be remembered long after you leave the cinema. Without giving you any spoilers let me just say from the opening sky high scene that rivals the best of any James Bond scenario the pace is set for a bleak, but thrilling 'so called' conclusion mastermind Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight series. Soon to be the new Mad-Max, Tom Hardy (seen but not forgotten in Sucker Punch) plays ultra bad guy Bane with amazing confrontation. Challenging Batman mentally and physically you will not soon forget his chaotic reign. Anne Hathaway albeit an alarming choice as Selina/Catwoman will surprise the die-hards while the amazing cast is listless, Michael Caine has some tender moments amongst the mayhem and new addition Joseph Gordon-Levitt challenges to further his history with and legacy of the Wayne foundation. Spiderman will spin off into the distance the minute the caped crusader appears in cinemas. Must see."
"The Dark Knight Rises has an epic scale and grandeur unlike any other modern film and rivals the scope of such classic films as The Godfather, Gone with the Wind, and Lawrence of Arabia. What Christopher Nolan has done here is achieve a rare feat matched only by Peter Jackson, Sergio Leone, and Ingmar Bergman. He has crafted a near perfect film trilogy, where each film can stand on its own as well as against its counterparts, and the Nolan Batman trilogy is, beyond a doubt, the greatest comic book trilogy in film history.

That being said, The Dark Knight Rises is not without flaws. The main issue lies within the first 30 minutes of the film, which jumps around quite a bit and reveals a couple of the logical fallacies that prevent the film from being Nolan's masterpiece, a title I would still give to Inception. These fallacies are small enough that they in no way inhibit the enjoyment of the picture (with one exception, which doesn't inhibit enjoyment so much as it puts into question a critical plot point of the film), and, due to the volume of fresh characters we are introduced to, a certain jumpiness is necessary in order to get the plot moving. However, there is a moment about an hour and a half into the film, that propels the film onto another level, where all previous issues are cast aside and you are swept up in the sheer scale of what is occurring on screen, and from this point on I have no hesitation in calling the final half of this film a masterwork.

From top to bottom the cast of The Dark Knight Rises excels. Michael Caine in particular shines in just a few scenes, providing the emotional backbone needed for a film of this nature, and Christian Bale continues to be great in his underrated performance as Bruce Wayne. Joseph Gordon-Levitt also excels in a more reserved performance as Officer John Blake, and Anne Hathaway is better than anyone could have imagined as Selina Kyle. While Tom Hardy wasn't given much opportunity to flex his acting skills, his performance did provide the necessary physicality to buy Bane as a very potent opponent of Batman. Not Tom Hardy's fault, but I should note that Bane's voice may be difficult to discern initially, creating more confusion in the opening sequence than need be, but after a couple scenes his dialogue is much more easily discernible. If there is one complaint to have with the cast it's that Marion Cotillard, perhaps the greatest actress of her generation, is underused in her supporting role as Miranda Tate.

I would like to make one note on the cinematography of the film. Christopher Nolan is perhaps second only to Martin Scorsese and Paul Thomas Anderson in his use of the camera as a storytelling tool, and this skill becomes clear during the spectacularly shot action sequences, almost all of which were shot on 70mm IMAX film. If you can see this film on an IMAX screen, and not an AMC IMAX screen but a real IMAX screen, this is the one film that positively begs to be viewed on a screen as large as possible.

In the end, the sheer scale of The Dark Knight Rises blows away the logical fallacies that inevitably accompany a film of this nature. It takes the best elements of its predecessors, the epic scale of The Dark Knight combined with the psychology of Batman Begins (which must be viewed before watching TDKR), to craft one of the most satisfying third acts in motion picture history. If there is one last complement to be given to Christopher Nolan, it is that he has created the end all Batman trilogy. There will inevitably be more Batman films made in the future, but nothing will ever come close to what Nolan has accomplished with his three films. He revolutionized the industry, brought a sense of realism back to both Batman and the superhero genre as a whole, and forever raised the standard to which blockbuster films must be held.

Grade: 8.5/10 (A-)"
"Christopher Nolan's Batman films have both surprised & disappointed me. On one-hand, Nolan has strived to ground the mythos into as realistic and relatable setting as possible. Given the suspension of disbelief needed for most of these comic book adaptations, the change was risky and admirable. However, along the way, specifically with the second film 'The Dark Knight', Nolan's realistic setting is at odds with increasingly implausible and fantastical happenings. This sense of imbalance carries over to the bloated & meandering final film.

'Rises' spends the greater part of its nearly three-hour runtime in escalation, introducing plot lines & characters that serve too embellish a sense of importance & complexity too the proceedings. The main issue with the film is that the majority of the multiple plot lines are poorly executed and unnecessary. For example, while the character played by Anne Hathaway adds a touch of much needed sarcasm & sensuality to the overtly serious proceedings, her motivations & actions are never explained.

On the other hand, the characters of Bane & John Blake were well-etched and save the film from outright mediocrity. Bane is equal parts fascinating & menacing, with a convincingly crafted back story that forms the emotional core of the film. Whereas the Joker is the titular villain in the Batman mythos, he is ultimately an absurd character that lacked development & conviction in the previous film. While I never viewed Joker as a legitimate threat in the previous film, Bane's actions are well-plotted & he challenges Batman accordingly. However, both characters actions are ultimately unrealistic, resulting in a film that is neither crime drama nor superhero fantasy.

John Blake is the only other character in the film that is well-etched. Unlike Lt. Gordon, Lucius Fox, & Alfred, Blake rises above being mere plot device & garners genuine emotion through a well-developed back story, realistic staging, & strong motivations/actions. As it stands, I found Gordon-Levitt's Blake a far more convincing & interesting character than anything Nolan has written for Bruce Wayne since the end of the first film.

Thus lies the main problem with 'Rises', Bruce Wayne & his Batman alter-ego come off as emotionally stilted & reactionary rather than mature & intelligent. This is most likely based on the poor narrative in the previous film, where I had trouble buying into Wayne's relationships & Batman's fall from grace. The character has simply failed to develop since the first film.

It's not helping that the films script & technical aspects are also poorly manipulated. While Nolan's script for Begins was generally competent, it's still hard to digest moments of thought-provoking dialog intermixed with sophomoric dramatization, & cheesy one-liners.

While a few scenes stood out in this film, particularly in the beginning sequence & Bane's prison, the cinematography on display lacked any sort of flourish, reveling in gritty skylines & explosions over any sort of interesting composition. The action sequences are admirable, if not poorly shot. Sound editing & mixing are first-rate. The score by Hans Zimmer is abysmal.

Overall, The Dark Knight Rises is a film that falters due to a weak foundation. 'Rises' ambition & scope are grand, however, it's setting and characters lack development and conviction, ultimately rendering much of the proceedings hollow & self-important. As summer entertainment, Dark Knight rises is the best of the bunch, a gem amongst a sea of nameless sequels, testosterone driven action films, regressive family fare, & tasteless comedies. As a film, however, 'Rises' has no reason to exist, it stands tall amongst such relevant masterworks as 'Avatar' & 'The Matrix'.

Stay for the taut & thrilling opening sequence that introduces Bane's character, than fast-forward through the rest."
"you disappointed me Nolan, what the f? -cheesy way of ending conflicts -uninteresting characters. -deus ex machine in its cheap form. -sleepy time in action sequences (not in the ""more hardcore action, images that balance content"" persuasion). -destroyed the image of a passionately followed character (not talking about batman). -are you going to slack in next project? -more preproduction man, think stuff trough. -where you in contract debt to finish the movie or something? -you know you are better than writing stuff for the ridiculous ""10 line in comment"" rule last night i proved my girlfriend its a hassle to take care of one another while drunk"
"The Dark Knight definitely is a great conclusion of the Batman trilogy. Nolan has once again captured the essence of how the Batman universe should be like. He has established the right balance of action, suspense, drama and a bit of humor in the film.

Also, adding Bane and Catwoman to the roster of characters is brilliant. Bane (Tom Hardy) induces the right image and feeling of fear, and dominance, added by his sheer display of intellect. His brute physique is matched by his wit, Brains and brawn I might say. While Catwoman (Anne Hathaway) is simply a sight for me to see. Though I was a bit surprised by the idea of Hathaway as Selina Kyle, turns out, she's the perfect and had the done the best performance ever as the feline femme fatale.

Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine are seriously veterans in their craft. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's role as a policeman turned detective gave an awesome performance. Christian Bale definitely pulled the Batman role, this movie had the character at its weakest but still made a strong impression for us.

The effects, I give it a 10, the musical score, definitely a 10++++ thanks Hans Zimmer.

Christopher Nolan, you have portrayed Batman and its characters that are unimaginably the best there is. And I would love to watch it again and again.

:)

*cheers"
"Caught this at the Majestic 10 in Williston, VT on Sunday July 15th. It was a special benefit sponsored by Senator Patrick Leahy. Christopher Nolan demanded that it must be shown in 35mm, so that was an added bonus! A fitting end to the Nolan trilogy. It's hard to pick a favorite of the 3 films, although Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker in The Dark Knight probably makes that film the standout in the trilogy.

As always, ingenious camera-work, sound, visual effects and great acting performances from Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, etc. Anne Hathaway was GREAT as Catwoman. Not as psycho and unpredictable as past portrayals. That's what's great about the Nolan take on this series - making all this plausible through acting, script and casting choices.

Tom Hardy's Bane was a bit of a letdown for me. No fault of Hardy, but Bane is kind of a boring, muscle head type villain. He's got this face mask covering him, making it harder to connect emotionally, and his back-story wasn't really explored in depth. Not nearly as interesting as the villains we've seen.

overall, definitely worth seeing, even if you aren't a Batman fan."
"The Batman is a worshiped character throughout the world of movie goers as well as comic book fans specially after 'The Dark Knight' where the makers achieved the impossible and made you question your ways of thought about the day to day world. The more you plan and scheme, the more things can go NOT according to plan, rather why not embrace chaos? The world isn't fair so why follow moral codes and ethics? Why make friends and why follow the rules set out by someone else? Only a movie like The Dark Knight could have made anyone feel like that.

Christopher Nolan studied literature in college for a reason and that reason is apparent in his films. He brings a sense of great storytelling with the massive scale and canvas for his audiences. He doesn't make movies just for intelligent and spectacular entertainment but forces the viewer to think a lot after one has witnessed his product. He makes the hero more human than anyone else can and tells you how everyone can be a hero in their own universe.

The Dark Knight Rises hovers a lot lower than The Dark Knight simply because it is more of the same. It feels more of a sequel to 'Batman Begins' than anything else. It doesn't blow your mind off. It doesn't show or give you a feeling that you've never had before because the theme of the film revolves around fear and disparity, lies and betrayals and how you choose to rise above that. However it treats the fictional characters as best as possible. There are fantastic elements for the promised epic conclusion but somewhere it lacks a little bit in the tight and nerve jangling screenplays we are used to from the Nolan Brothers. There is a release of pressure in places at times so the audience gets at the edge of the seat then slides back and then comes back up. This one ties all loose ends, the story comes full circle with a promise and hope for a better future without which peace cannot be sustained. The legend ends in style nevertheless.

You do tend to expect more from the man who gave us the Joker's epic lines, which is unfair. In its own right, The Dark Knight Rises Rose well above most films of the Action/Adventure/Crime genre.

These films are beyond actors, beyond technicalities, beyond film makers themselves. If you've ever laughed or cried or cheered at any projected moving image, you cannot afford to miss this trilogy."
The Dark Night Rises is one of mine's favorite movie. Christan Bale and Tom Hardy are classy and they show great commitment to they roles. Fascineting scenes. Just brilliant. After Joker is hard to find a true rival for Batman. But Bane was great and I really enjoyed. I watched this movie two or three time. And I'm gonna watch it again. Such a great story and I'm sad because it can't be minimum ten Batman movies. Who wasn't see this must see it. Now. I really hope this review helped someone who was undecided about this movie. The women in movie was great and I love them. Marion Cotillard and Anna Hathaway are beautiful and really good actresses. They merged they two very good.
"The movie repeatedly refers to events that happened in past movies as though viewers are intimately familiar with those details. If you don't really remember what happened there, be prepared for an eternity (2:45) of asking what's going on. Thankfully though, there is still enough new material to keep the movie reasonably interesting on its own.

I was left feeling unclear about Bane's motives for wanting control of Gotham City and I didn't understand the financial arrangements that Bane invoked to inflict pain.

Plenty of the police elements were ridiculous, for example, how could the sewer gang grow so large without the police knowing about it? Furthermore, Bane not only pre-empts, but relies upon some of the police's actions even though those actions are only triggered by what's presented as genius breakthroughs.

Batman's habit of refusing to use guns is childishly naïve, inconsistent and it occasionally causes the deaths of police. This is a movie that gave me a strong urge to yell at the screen and give advice to the main character."
"I had the privilege of watching ""The Dark Knight Rises"" on IMAX screen and the 70 odd minutes footage shot with IMAX camera.

The movie opens with the introduction of the most talked about villain of the movie, Bane who abducts a Russian nuclear physicist while Bruce Wayne spends his days crippled and low in morale. The cop John Blake brings the need for Batman to Bruce Wayne amidst the mysterious deaths happening at the city sewage outlet and the murder attempt on Commissioner Gordon conducted by Bane's mob. These events ignite the desire in Bruce Wayne to return to Gotham city and remove the peril cast upon Gotham City. In the due course, it is learned that the Bane is a rep. from The League Of Shadows whose interest lies in destroying the crime stricken Gotham city to restore balance in the human civilization. The arrival of the Batman is when Bane attacks the GSE(Gotham Stock Exchange) and tantalizes the taste of Bane's intellect. The cat-woman/Seline is employed by Bane's mob to steal Wayne's fingerprints to manipulate his stock holdings where Bruce is forced to be out of the Wayne Enterprises, depriving him of the support to/from the Applied Sciences department. Lucis Fox, as always, comes back with his latest innovation, The Bat, which is put to most use towards the climax. Miranda, who eventually romances with Bruce, saves the interests of Wayne Enterprise in the nuclear head which is part of a nuclear fusion project along with Lucis Fox, on the request of Bruce Wayne himself.

Catwoman cheats again on the Batman and sells him to Bane, who brutally beats down Batman and locks him up to get hold of his state of art artillery along with the nuclear war head. John Blake, made a detective by Commissioner Gordon, rambles around on the search for Bruce Wayne and finds that a large scale explosive deployment has been done by Bane while the Deputy Commissioner takes all the police force through the maintenance system to smoke up Bane. There comes the rugby match which gets affected by the serial bombing conducted by Bane alongside other city's bridges and places of prominence. This locks up the police under ground and further, the nuclear bomb threat limits the military action.

During his stay at the prison, Batman realizes that Ra's Al Ghul is behind the motive of Bane's to destroy Gotham and also learns about his past.

The Batman returns to action after enough hardship to escape from the prison on the advice of a doctor and finds Gotham in utter chaos after Bane manages to release all the criminals locked up due to Dent's act. With the help of the realized cat-woman and Det. Blake, he releases the police to action and fight the criminals. Batman now has the win over Bane in a fight, who finally gets killed by the cat-woman. 'The Bat' helps the batman to pull over the nuclear bomb to the distant seas and save Gotham finally.

The continuation on TDKR seems most likely after the reappearance of Bruce Wayne, united with Seline and Alfred and the inclusion of the Det. Blake as 'Robin'

Christopher Nolan brought in enough drama into the movie to make it a fitting end)may not be an end as such) to the trilogy, but few instances in the script put the TDKR a line behind the TDK."
"The first thing I have noticed is,,we got a situation in the movie,,and again and again we struct in it. its beyond a movie,,beyond a story. Its about a hope,,about a regular prayer for the man with a mask for the last 4 years when he was running and dogs and cops were chasing him. After watching the dark knight in 2008,,I became the disciple of Batman. after watching the dark knight rises,,I realized he is god. sometimes when your excitement level cross the limits,,,u cant explain much. Same happens to me. Batman is a normal human being, who inspired us to ask Jesus Christ not to take our sins. He is among and within us showing the way of perfection and purification."
"I would give this 8.5/10. It's very, very good.

First and foremost this movie is more about Bruce Wayne than Batman. It's about Bruce learning to live in a world where he feels he has nothing to live for. It's about the demons of the past coming forward to haunt and exact vengeance for those wrongs, and how Bruce must learn to overcome them, and finally learn to live in the present and not the past.

Michael Cain gives an outstanding performance - heartbreaking, even. He has cared for Bruce since the day he was born, and he's seen the pain and suffering he has endured. It's clear Alfred cannot take much more of Bruce living in misery, and the tension between them is palpable.

When Bane arrives and they do their research to find out more about him, Alfred genuinely becomes concerned that Bruce is about to set out on a suicide mission. Worse still, Alfred believes Bruce wants to die in this way.

The rest of the movie is what you'd expect - lots of amazing action, typical, subtle Nolan humor is written throughout. Anne Hathaway provides some much needed distraction and is good eye candy. She also represents the counterpart Bruce needs to move on with his life, or end it.

Bane is an intense and charismatic villain. I hate to say it, but it will take reading the script or watching it a dozen times to understand everything he said. And for anyone that didn't think Tom Hardy was big enough? Well, there's certainly a shot early on that shows his impressive physicality. He's much bulkier and more ripped than Bruce ever was.

The fights between Batman/Bane are what most hardcore fans are looking forward to and they were done well. I won't spoil things too much, but I think they did a good job of showing that Batman is not the fighter he once used to be - age and injury have slowed him down a bit. He really is in a fight for his life when he encounters Bane.

The last 1/2 hour of this movie is brilliant, stunning, and has more twists and emotional resonance than most will have anticipated. It's gripping, heart wrenching, and bittersweet - all at the same time. A stirring conclusion."
"whoa!!! yep.. thats the first word that came to my mind after watching "" THE DARK KNIGHT RISES"" first day first show. And yes the dark knight does rise to the occasion along with its director Christopher Nolan. Finally we have a super hero movie franchise which wont be remembered just for its action and special effects but for the acting prowess of all the actors and the director. I personally didn't have much expectation from the movie,because, lets be honest, the dark knight and late heath ledger as legendary joker gave us everything. thats what i thought to be honest. But the series needed an ending, and what an ending it was.

Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne is as reliable as ever and delivers a flawless performance. our beloved Legends Michael Caine,Morgan Freeman and Garry Oldman( Alfred, Mr.Fox, Commissioner Gordon) once again show in this movie that no matter how big or small a role they have in the movie, the scenes which involved them were truly amazing. But what surprised me the most were the performances of Anne Hathway as Catwoman and Joseph-Gordon Levit as John Blake. They played their parts with amazing perfection and you cant help but to fall in love with the ever so cunning and mysterious Anne Hathaway as the cat-woman. Which leaves us with Tom Hardy as Bane. To be honest i was a bit disappointed when it came to him, not because he didn't do justice to the role( which he totally did) but because Heath Leader as Joker set the standards so high that you cant help but noticing that bane will all his physical presence, strength and the mysterious mask doest quite attract you the same way as joker did.

But in totality, The Dark Knight rises with all its twists and turns and suspense( and trust me there is quite a lot of suspense in it ) totally lives up to its expectations despite being too predictable at times, this movie is a classic and a MUST WATCH. As all good things must come to an end this was the end of the franchise and our beloved superhero, but wait, was it really the end ?? THE LENGEND Doesn't END, BUT INDEED RISES AGAIN!!!"
"After it's prequel ""The Dark Knight"" did not live up to my high expectations due to a confusing, overladen plot, I was positively surprised by Christopher Nolan's conclusion of his Batman trilogy ""The Dark Knight Rises"".

While it's not my personal best comic book (graphic novel!) adaptation ever, since masterpieces like ""Watchmen"" or ""V for Vendetta"", ""Spider-Man 2"" and, I have to admit, even ""Marvel's: The Avengers"" simply thrilled me a great deal more, TDKR is certainly a great action film to enjoy, and as far as I'm concerned, better than the previous one. The nearly three hours it took quickly passed by which is always a good sign and I never had the feeling that the story had no real direction as with TDK. What I liked the most was the villain: Bane

Bane just got me. He's dangerous and he's evil. Even The Joker would have payed him respect if he had done such things at all. A lot of critics compared Bane to Hannibal Lecter because of the martial mouth mask he's wearing, but I'd like to compare him to Darth Vader and Darth Vader is cool. There is a scene near the end of TDKR (those who saw will know) that could have been directly derived from a similar scene in ""Star Wars: Episode 6"", and of course there is this heavily breathing, electronically enhanced voice of his that reminded me the most of the dark lord. Above that, Bane is also a tragic figure who has a heart somewhere beneath all the bull-like muscle mass.The melee between him and Batman belonged to my personal highlights of the entire film although I was somewhat surprised that Batman somehow seemed to have forgotten how to use his utility belt and only relied on the power of his fists which did not really pay off. As a mercenary, Bane commands a huge army of heavily armed mercenary soldiers. Why they're following him and even willing to die for him, unfortunately is left for guessing. Nolan, as often is the case, fails to give a deeper meaning, a deeper understanding to the motivations of his characters, some reason beyond the sheer urge to simply create chaos and destruction. The same goes with Selina Kyle/Catwoman.

Catwoman is an attractive, professional thief with some martial arts skills who is looking for a way out of the criminal milieu and thus comes in touch with Batman. Where she is from, how she has become Catwoman,why she is steeling and the reason for her change of mind remains again unclear. Apart from this, I liked the way she interacted with Batman. Her dialogues were very witty and teasing, you could feel a certain sizzling between them. I find it interesting to draw a comparison to Tim Burton's version of Catwoman and I come to the conclusion that, to me, Michelle Pfeiffer's performance is much more fascinating, much darker and grittier than that of Anne Hathaway who is certainly a very good actress.

Then there is another new character: Joseph Gordon-Levitt as police officer John Blake. Blake is seemingly the most intelligent, most righteous policeman of all the other ones including commissioner James Gordon who is put to shadow by Blake's investigative skills even outshining Batman formerly known as the world's greatest detective who always needed someone to explain him what's going on which does not do him justice. Blake was the driving force while Bruce wallowed in self-pity.

By the way, where was Batman all the time? It's quite remarkable how little screen time the actual main figure had in his own film apart from some fist fights and a few minor action scenes where he was making some cool stunts on his bike or flying around in an aircraft that looked rather like an iron turtle. Instead, Nolan focused on his true identity: Bruce Wayne, an, in the meantime, tired and decrepit shadow of a former glamorous billionaire who is living isolated in his manor like a hermit still mourning the loss of his love Rachel and seemingly deprived of any purpose in life since his initiated ""Dent-law"" freed the city from organized crime. Even his butler and father substitute Alfred sees no good in this inaction and loneliness. What's his proposed cure? Yes, of course, it's a woman. A fact leading to a somewhat clichéd Hollywood-friendly ending.

Nolan is an undoubtedly great director whose approach to present Batman in a more realistic setting and thus being able to address (or rather broach) subjects like the economical crisis, the gab between the rich and poor, environmental issues etc. at the latest, stands on no solid ground as soon as words as ""League of Shadows"" come into play. The circumstance that The Dark Knight is a comic hero after all firstly cannot be ignored and secondly always leads to a tension with the ambitious epic seriousness of the plot which Nolan does not consequently solve. The film is sometimes to serious to be taken seriously, an epos with flaws."
"It has been eight years since Batman vanished into the night, turning, in that instant, from hero to fugitive. Assuming the blame for the death of D.A. Harvey Dent, the Dark Knight sacrificed everything for what he and Commissioner Gordon both hoped was the greater good. For a time the lie worked, as criminal activity in Gotham City was crushed under the weight of the anti-crime Dent Act. But everything will change with the arrival of a cunning cat burglar with a mysterious agenda. Far more dangerous, however, is the emergence of Bane, a masked terrorist whose ruthless plans for Gotham drive Bruce out of his self-imposed exile. But even if he dons the cape and cowl again, Batman may be no match for Bane...."
"well before entering the theater like most of u guys i had 3 questions in mind... 1:would it b worth the 4 year gap? 2:can it outdo the last one (pretty tough one)? and finally would this be the end of the Nolan- batman saga? one thing more i didn't watch a single trailer of this movie on purpose which was pretty hard though....so the excitement was sky high . so after watching the movie ....its not as good as the dark knight ...reasons : heath ledger was too good , the story of this part is not as complex as last one ...this is the kind of story which builds up to a magnificent climax but offers little before ...plus this part deals with more characters than last one so less time to build them up... the MOST INTERESTING and exciting part is the ending which gives a definite hint of a new series!!"

"Whilst I enjoyed the first two Nolan Batman efforts, I cannot understand why the IMDb rating is so high for this film. Many other reviewers are gushing over a film that is

1. Far too long and bloated 2. Contains many embarrassingly clichéd one liners 3. Dilutes the aura surrounding the Batman character

I applaud the fact that this film was shot and finished on film, not digitally, so it LOOKS great, but it is nowhere near Nolan's best work. It had some clever and huge set pieces, but failed to shown any heart. The second movie had set it up for a stunning return of the Bat, but instead tried to be too smart. The ending in particular, was not emotive at all, just sugar coated.

I was squirming in my seat at much of the twee dialogue. And, Batman, get yourself a new voice coach - you sound hilarious, are you supposed to be?"
"A satisfying and beautiful ending to such a significant trilogy with not one flaw. story and character development wise , everything fit perfectly into place in the end and i don't think there's a single thing i would change apart from wanting ANOTHER MOVIE. definitely lives up to the hype 110% and honestly deserved more award attention due to the production and excellence of the film itself - aside from the actors incredible performances (i see u christian 😏). never underestimate the power of christopher nolan."
"After seeing what are arguably two of the best films in cinematic history in Inception and The Dark Knight I had very high hopes for this film. I have followed the Batman films and the TV shows from an early age and I think that Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director, however after paying through the nose to see this conclusion to his trilogy on the opening day I felt he could have done so much more with this film.

I'll start with the good things about this film.

1) Anne Hathaway was surprisingly very good in the film. She offered something new and fresh not seen before and the on screen chemistry with Bale was exceptional. Her character is also a lot more intriguing than that of Tom Hardy's Bane whose muffled, almost in inaudible voice nearly ruins the film by itself.

2) John Blake played by JGL is a strong addition to the cast and his performance as Blake does not go unnoticed.

3) The production values and cinematography are second to none and that is to be expected from a Nolan film.

4) Michael Caine is nothing short of brilliant. He offers raw emotion and substance.Two things which are otherwise lacking in the film.

And sadly that is about all the plus points from this clunky, pretentious, overlong mess of a film. I have the feeling that Nolan's heart just wasn't in this one unlike its predecessors. The script is poor, the pacing is terrible, Tom Hardy is completely wasted in his role and worst of all it doesn't feel like a Batman film. There is no tension or suspense and the story lacks flow and direction. The film offers short glimpses of excellence such as the chase scene between batman and the police and the scene between Alfred and Bruce where Alfred tries desperately to try and convince Bruce to hang up his cape for good. The second fight scene between Batman and Bane is also pretty entertaining as is the last ten minutes. But for a film that clocks in at nearly three hours these scenes are not enough to save it.

Another annoying thing about the film is the action or lack of. Most of the action scenes are given away in the trailers and none of which are that original apart from the scene at the start. Big explosions and lots of guns and that's about it. Batman doesn't even get that much screen time. But the most disappointing thing is the weak script and cheesy dialogue both of which are not something that Nolan usually gives us. Way too many things going on and every character for some reason feels the need to give their own Harvey Dent style declaration along the lines of ''you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain''.

It is so disappointing for me to be writing a bad review for this film and as for everyone saying it's brilliant or it's just as good as the others they are simply in denial or they're flat out lying. It is neither terrible or brilliant. I will of course buy it when it comes out on DVD as it is a good film and deserves a 7 out of 10 and should be viewed more than once and I expect my mind to wander on second viewing as some parts are boring. Just don't go into this movie with high hopes or expecting to see a masterpiece because it simply isn't.

Massive Disappointment."
"One star for Joseph Gordon-Levitt's fresh and believable take on the rookie cop with street smarts, ideals and courage.

One star for Anne Hathaway's purr-fect performance as the Catwoman.

One star for an aging Michael Caine, in memory of the man who was a king.

Beyond that, it's all a murky sea of meaningless explosions, sodden speeches, missed opportunities, and plot holes you could drive the Batmobile through.

Some lowlights include . . .

A super villain who mumbles so much he might just as well have a sock in his mouth. And speaking of laundry, why can't Bane afford an undershirt?

A doctor who explains in clinical detail, with X-rays, exactly why Bruce Wayne can't fight anymore. Just so his fight scenes will feel even more fake than they already did.

A pointless half hour in a phony-looking prison in some make believe foreign country where guys walk around all day clapping and chanting. Cool Hand Luke, this ain't. I really didn't care if Bruce Wayne climbed out of that stupid hole with a rope -- but then, the guards didn't seem to care much either. (""Climbin' out of here, boss!"" ""Yeah, Bruce, climb on out of there."") All I wanted was for Bruce to ""prove"" himself by eating fifty eggs, like in the Paul Newman classic. And at the end he could send the boys a postcard of him back in Gotham City, wearing a custom-made suit, with his arms around Miranda and Selena Kyle. And the card could just say, ""Boys, playing it cool -- Bruce.""

A staggering total of 3000 cops trapped in a sewer for three months -- yet they all emerge in clean uniforms, in good health, ready to beat Bane's minions in a good old-fashioned street brawl. And even that was more exciting than watching Bane and Batman go one-on-one.

This movie could have been twice as good and half as long, with one tenth of the money spent. All it takes is imagination, courage, and respect for the audience."
Very good Film to watch with family. Lots of Action Suspense and Drama. Lots of really good talent. The movie is one to add to your collection if you have any of the others. Always looking forward for more to come from the Actors. The story line is great and is always different with each film. They use different Men to play the part but they always choose the right men to play the parts. Would love to act in a future film of the movie or meet the actors in person. The movie can become so real for kids they pretend to be the actor on the movie. Love how it keeps kids looking forward to want to be the action hero. By wearing capes even little girls get involved in the action as well.
"Jan 6, 2022 While everyone can agree that Batman Begins is the worst of the Nolan trilogy I think people severely underrate this movie while focusing on the Dark Knight. The Dark Knight is a great movie with Ledger's performance being iconic but personally The Dark Knight Rises is all around a better movie. It is very well shot (as most of Nolan's movies are) and it's a really great storyline personally. A great cast to surround Bale with actors like Tom Hardy, Anne Hathaway, Joseph Gordon Levitt along with the usuals who were around from the last 2 films. The movie is full of iconic moments from me and a great way to end the trilogy one of the best payoffs that the character could get. The only criticism I have is the lack of development for certain characters and the reveals being mildly sudden and often unnecessary but otherwise a great movie all around and it gets a light 4 from me."
"With beautiful cinematography, top tier acting, powerful score, a solid plot, perfect ending, perfect pacing, great balance, nice CGI, amazing dialogues... The Dark Knight Rises is a greatly satisfying and epic conclusion to the trilogy.

""A hero can be anyone, even a man doing something as simple and reassuring as putting Aa coat around a young boy's shoulders to let him know the world hadn't ended."""
"I love heath ledger and his joker in the dark knight, but this movie has the perfect cat woman and an amazing bane. It's one of the most motivational movies as well. Christopher Nolan is the best director of all time."
"This had the polar opposite expectations that Begin had because it followed up one of the best movies ever made while begins followed by one of the worst movies ever made. It's not to say this is flawless because there are a couple of nitpicks I personally have but this is a fantastic way to wrap up the entire trilogy. It has one of the best villains to be ever put on film and I mean it. Bane's voice, his demeanor, and Tom Hardy's performance are intimidating but he is also similar to Batman because he is doing it for someone he loves. People are mad about the twist, calling him a henchman. He is no henchman, he is an ally. We even see that after Talia left, he attempted to kill Batman which is smart as hell because he didn't want things to go sideways, but they did. The way he dies acts karma because Bane killed people like pawns and it went full circle because Selina Kyle made a joke which treated him like it was nothing. Also, if he died slower, it would just waste time. And Bruce's journey is one of the best things because people point out that it's repetitive, and it's not. The first time, he puts the cape and cowl on, he becomes a suicide bomber, he is certain he will die and he can't stop Bane from burning Gotham to ashes, he is doing it for selfish desires because he believes there is nothing there for him, and when he climbs out of the pit, he returns to the symbol he was. Also, Bruce climbing out of the prison is fantastic and him getting into the city isn't a plothole because he used the 23 days he had and you know BB told us that he knew to steal, and someone forgot about being invisible. Also, the neighboring city isn't on lockdown, so he can get in there just to go to the city. Seriously, it's so bloody apparent. Also, this is the most thematic of the entire trilogy, with the theme of love, redemption, corruption, and vengeance"
"There're so many negative aspects of this movie it's hard to point out all of them. The title of this writing might be weird, but that is what I felt about this movie - an empty tin can!

The first impression that I had after watching this movie is it's all made up, like a clichéd dialog in the movie ""It's all part of a plan!"" The director already decided what ""AWE FACTOR""s he is going to cover. I used the term from an official documentary of the Dark Knight Rises, most likely from Tom Hardy.

It looks like the director and the producers thought that ""Oh! It's the finale, it must have these and these elements."" Then they fabricated a story to tie up the lose ends, and this story was also made up rather hastily.

What this produces is a completely predictable, unintelligent and repetitive movie. There is no intense drama, thrills, or intense action, no feel, and no philosophical or psychological dilemma that conjured up the first two movies of the trilogy. In other words, things that made Batman Begins and Dark Knight special are completely absent from this movie.

What is more depressing to see is that people are fooled by the deception and the movie gets a high rating round about 9.0

If I trust the rating system and there has been no anomaly there then only possible explanation can be due to wide media-hype, the movie gained a huge audience who are not even familiar with the depth and strength of the first two movies and got baffled by the ""AWE FACTOR""s and came out of the theater satisfied.

The character development in this movie is very weak to say for the least and their attitude and behavior is rather cheesy and unnecessarily replicating that of the Dark Knight. Has anyone actually noticed the opening scene of hijacking Dr. Pavel from the aircraft? The scene is enthralling to watch in IMAX, but the reason behind this adventurous (suicidal in real-life scenario!) attempt is really trivial. And the acting, dialogue, finger-pointing of the CIA officer who is in command of the plane is more like the joker in the Dark Knight. Well it's 8 years later. But the mood still bears the flavor of Dark Knight, which is rather out of place.

The only plus the movie has is Bane, his voice in the Blu-ray release is OK, but in theatrical release it is hardly understandable. And why the movie sheds no light on Bane's personal life, why he carries a grudge against Gotham, but not against Ducard (Ra's Al Ghul) who excommunicated him from the League of Shadows, and why why Nolan converts him from a gruesome killer to a weakened lover and a mercenary are pathetically unresolved.

The basic flaw with any superhero movie is its end is always predictable, the bad guys lose the good guys win. What make it special are not the visuals or effects, rather its story-line, emotional aspects and the message it carries. The Dark Knight Rises fails in all these categories and I don't know whether the dark knight has risen or not but Nolan has certainly fallen to the level of ordinary.

The Dark Knight Rises is certainly the most awaited disappointment I've faced after Star Wars: The Phantom Menace..."
"Where the last two films in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy played more or less like fairly intimate stories in the Batman universe, this one feels like it's going for the biggest scale it possibly could, with as much destruction and as many thugs as you can fit on screen. The problem here is the unrelentingness of everything that settles in at about the halfway mark. It grows tiring long before the climax kicks in because it's just too much of everything.

Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) has become a recluse and ""Batman"" has gone into hiding for the past 8 years since Harvey Dent's death. After an encounter with a cat burglar, Selena Kyle (Anne Hathaway) and an inspiring speech from his butler Alfred (Michael Caine), Bruce decides he needs to go back out to social events, and begin fighting crime as Batman again. Meanwhile, masked terrorist Bane (Tom Hardy), and a large group of followers take over Gotham city, destroying all ways of leaving or coming in, with the threat of setting off a nuclear bomb located on the island. Meanwhile (yet again), Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) is severely injured by Bane and stuck in the hospital, a new hot head cop John Blake (Joseph Gordon Levitt) is trying to stop Bane through detective work, and Wayne board member Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard) is given control of Wayne Enterprises. Bane massacres Bruce Wayne and throws him into a prison located elsewhere, and it's up to Bruce to summon his strength to try and escape. Meanwhile the criminals take over Gotham and anarchy ensues.

There are a lot of characters here, but they are balanced in their sub-plots quite well. Anne Hathaway gives a really good performance as ""Catwoman"", both hamming it up at times, and also remaining quite subtle when appropriate. Levitt is also a good addition to the cast, as we have a character to care about that is fighting crime, but through detective work and not through being placed in the action like ol' Batman. Having so many main characters was nice to try and avoid repetition, though from the last hour plus, it doesn't work well enough.

The film grows somewhat boring by about the halfway mark. The pace becomes unrelenting, and it's just somewhat of a sensory overload. The editing is quick, the shots are quick, and while stuff is happening and Gotham is about to become a smoldering pit, too much is happening too quickly. And when the villains take over Gotham, you begin thinking of scenarios that would happen with the people of Gotham, and how they would react, but nothing does. They pretty much just go into hiding. Unrealistically, no vigilantes even try to take some of the villains out, but whatever, that's not what the movie is about.

This movie is not above running on many action movie clichés that feel like they belong in lesser pictures. People saving others at the last minute after seemingly coming out of nowhere, and the old everybody else gets killed but the main characters (for no real reason), and then of course many coincidences that happen to effect the outcome of the picture. The same clichés you'd see in a movie like ""Sahara"" from a few years back are prominently used here. Character motives also seem to be slightly off. Why does Batman turn to Catwoman for help exactly? No real logical reason except to pair the two up.

Hans Zimmer's score is effective in driving the action, in that his music here mainly consists of low strings acting almost as drums to move everything along. It drives the action, but at the same time is extremely generic and not very interesting, but it does keep a rhythm going in the action. And unlike Inception, the generic weepy Zimmer music doesn't intrude on scenes that are trying to be emotional. It's a step up from Inception's score in that regard, but is still quite mediocre.

The climax of the film is nice. After all the twists and turns are introduced, it gets down to the heart of the story, and the last ten minutes or so, minus some coincidental and corny moments, are really good and satisfying. For the most part, the conclusion to the film is satisfying and works on an emotional level.

This film concludes the Dark Knight trilogy quite well. It's an imperfect film, with a lot of drag time in the middle of the picture, and just a few too many clichés thrown in, but the ending is mostly very nice, and as a whole, the picture is entertaining, full of action, and enough happens to justify it's nearly three hour length.

My rating: *** out of ****. 165 mins. PG-13 for nonstop action violence."
"Must be something about the bat-signal that causes people to up-rate blindly. This is over-produced, over-storied, and over-acted. Bale is wooden, the Bane character is stupid, the all-fists action is lame... it goes on.

I watched this followed by ""Bloodshot"" (2020). The latter, at a 5.7 rating, is a much better film. Choose it instead."
"In a season filled with big movies that somehow ask even bigger questions, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" feels like the superego to its competition's id. An action opus that manages at to be both viscerally and intellectually engaging, Christopher Nolan's highly anticipated third Batman film comes full circle, examining both the Dark Knight and the society that produced him without sacrificing any of the sweeping thrills for which the series is known. A literate, thoughtful and invigorating finale, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" delivers everything audiences ask for and then some, albeit in fewer of the ways that they might expect."
"No one can deny the unprecedented level of expectation that this film was pressured to live up to. Its predecessor - The Dark Knight not only topped most top movie 10 polls of 2008, but became widely recognised as possibly one of the best films of all time. Notwithstanding that was of course Nolan's interlude movie Inception, which again achieved spectacular feats not only at the box office but critically as well. To say the least, the pressure was on.

But fear not, I assure you this feature will be no disappointment. Set 8 years after the events of The Dark Knight, batman has hung up his cape, took the fall for Harvey Dent's crimes and now lives a solitary life as a recluse - that is until Tom Hardy's Bane causes havoc and promotes anarchy and chaos across Gotham.

One thing is for certain, Nolan has taken no chances with this movie; his script is every bit as clever and well thought out as all the films he has written. Unlike so many of today's superhero movies he doesn't rely on explosions and special effects to move his story from one scene to the other. Also, despite its large cast it doesn't feel as though the big names are fighting for screen time and story-lines unlike the last time Bane was disastrously placed on the big screen in 1997s Batman and Robin. What this movie manages to do which so many blockbusters don't, is balance an edge-of-your-seat action extravaganza with sustaining a level of intelligence that makes it more accessible for those not just looking for a few cheap thrills.

This does not go to say, however, that it does not have its faults. One thing I can honestly say is that while it may just match The Dark Knight, it does by no means beat it. Ledger's Joker was an adversary unrivalled by Hardy's Bane, although praise to in-keeping with the comic's perception of Bane must be noted for not overlooking his intellect or immense strength.

Overall The Dark Knight Rises somehow manages to live up to the high expectations placed on its shoulders. Nolan manages to deliver a film that ticks every box and yet still maintains a distance from the cliché blockbusters Hollywood rolls out every year. The only real question is what will he do next?"
"Seriously, I would put 11 stars if possible. Nolan delivers."
"The defining final chapter in Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy is easily the most ambitious in the trilogy too - an epic, larger than life conclusion to Batman and the city of Gotham, as he rises to the occasion (joke intended *ba dum tst*) to save the city from the menacing reach of Bane and the legacy of the League of Shadows he carries on.

It is somewhat one of the most epic films I've seen. It's a large scale blockbuster, similar to he previous two Nolan Batman films, but with THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, Nolan amps up the scale to an 11, with sets so massive and so viscerally immersive, that it makes the previous two films seem much more smaller. The story still feels very singular and personal despite the amped stakes, but it's such a massive piece of a film.

Where Batman Begins focuses on conquering fear and turning it into a strength, and The Dark Knight focuses on the morality of our actions, The Dark Knight Rises focuses on fallen figures, failed systems and rising from our falls, tying back to Batman Begins' theme of conquering fear and rising from that fall into fear.

For me, this is one of Nolan's best, only behind Interstellar and Inception for me. It's the best comic book film for me, and simply watching it again on a 15/70mm IMAX film print is a totally legendary and unbelievable experience. Seeing the projection on-screen expand onto the full 15/70mm IMAX format, taking on the entirety of the screen is simply swing and with the sound system of the BFI IMAX, it's a truly unparalleled experience; there's really no other experience like watching a Chris Nolan film at the IMAX.

This one is no exception either, being the most epic, massive conclusion to quite literally the best trilogy out there. Christopher Nolan crafted some magical blockbuster, superhero cinema with The Dark Knight Trilogy. It's truly an astoundingly original, inspired and creative vision and direction from Nolan; one that's unprecedented in the realm of superhero films"
This film does not disappoint and it is up to the previous two movies
"And so, after fours years since Batman went on sabbatical after the demise/incarceration of Harvey Dent and The Joker, respectively, Gotham is at one and at peace with itself. Will this peace last? Of course not as the people of Gotham City face their biggest threat yet in the form of thuggish heavy, Bane (Tom Hardy) and his entourage of equally destructive goons. Firstly this movie suffers slightly in cramming too many plot strands into it and the movie is too long as a result. The movie is thoroughly entertaining, nonetheless and Ann Hathaway, as the Catwoman is a surprise in that she's good. Where the film is not as good as the others is that the characterisation so present in the first two, is not there and so actors are wasted (Marion Coutillard and Morgan Freeman). The plot twists may surprise and the effects are jaw dropping but whilst this movie is entertaining, will not last long in the mind."
"He Dark Knight Rises is truly AMAZING

Nolan delivers an incredible conclusion to the greatest trilogy of all time. Great characters and performances, especially by Bale and Hathaway. Also, amazing final battle with an ending which leaves you wondering what really happened"
Best movie ever pretty damn great. Bane is a badass and cool action
"After eight years in seclusion, Batman resurfaces to face Bane, a mastermind bent on destroying Gotham and has ties to Bruce Wayne's past. Christopher Nolan's conclusion to his Dark Knight trilogy should be treated as a wrap up rather than a third installment. Despite many new characters being introduced, even their conflicts and motives are derived from events that occurred in the previous two films. Such an approach could be seen as a weakness, since the conflict could just end up being sort of a rematch rather than moving the story forward; however, Nolan's approach works terrificly. Over an hour is shot in stunning IMAX, but the film is more touching than it is intense and that's its best quality. Hardy steps in as the genius mercenary Bane, who is slightly bigger, slightly stronger and slightly smarter than Batman, thus making him a challenge best suited for the grand finale. The Joker works best as Batman's arch-nemesis since they are polar opposites, with The Joker standing for everything Batman stands against. Two-Face works best as Batman's most tragic enemy because Harvey Dent is very much like Bruce Wayne the only difference is: Dent copes with his tragedy through revenge rather than seeking justice as Wayne did. Bane works best as Batman's most challenging villain because of his physical and mental superiority—forget the Bane you saw in ""BATMAN & ROBIN"". Nolan carefully chose all his villains in the series wisely and executed them perfectly. Hardy had big shoes to fill following Ledger's posthumous Oscar winning performance; while Bane is no Joker, Hardy does a satisfying job and should not be compared to Ledger's performance as they are completely different roles. It is Michael Caine, however, that delivers the most memorable and touching performance of the entire film. A wonderful conclusion to a wonderful trilogy.

"The Dark Knight Rises was a perfect sequel to a masterpiece. Christopher Nolan took a different direction and focused more on Bruce Wayne/Batman. This movie is filled with lots of emotions. It has such great characters and of course the dialogs is so good. The performances are incredible. It was my most anticipated movie of the century. The more I watch it, The more epic it gets. Personally, I think The Dark Knight Trilogy is the greatest Trilogy of all time and this movie gives the greatest ending of all time in the movie history. I remember seeing it thrice and the more I watched It the more respect it earns. Thank you Christopher Nolan, You Sir Are A Master."
"Possibly my personal favourite of the Nolan Batman films, and I do like Batman Begins and The Dark Knight very much. Is it perfect? For me, not quite, there are so many plot strand in a long running time that the film occasionally(and there is a big emphasis on that) sags in momentum and some of the strands in the ending could have done with more development. It is a brilliant film all the same, one of the highlights so far of the year. As to expect from Christopher Nolan, it is a visually audacious film, with gorgeous cinematography, a beautifully realised Gotham City and great special effects. Hans Zimmer's score is not one of his very best for me, but there is still an epic and haunting quality that is just perfect for this film. The dialogue provokes thought and makes an emotional impact, and a vast majority of the time The Dark Knight Rises is ambitious and gripping. I don't consider Christopher Nolan one of my favourites, this said he is a hugely impressive director who shows great ambition and a willingness to make his subject matters interesting. He does a really wonderful job here, as the set/action pieces including the plane hijack and Bane's assault on Gotham are enough to make the jaw drop. The performances are just terrific from all involved, Matthew Modine fares weakest but he is far from bad. Christian Bale is still a charismatic presence, Matthew Caine appropriately loyal and Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman subtly understated. Joseph Gordon Levitt captures his character's idealism wonderfully. Tom Hardy is in beefed-up terrifying mode as Bane, a worthy successor to Heath Ledger's iconic Joker. Anne Hathaway was a curious casting choice, but as Catwoman she is spot on, here is a Catwoman who actually does much more than acting sexy(which she still is), she is very ruthless and no-nonsense here. All in all, a hugely impressive film, the best of Nolan's Batman trilogy- though I'm prepared for any flaming I'll get for this opinion- and one of the highlights so far of 2012. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"There's a storm coming .....

Years after being villified, Batman is encouraged once again to come Gotham's aid, as it's in the grip of a group of mercenaries run by the villainous Bane.

First of all, you don't have to be a superhero fan to enjoy this great movie, it truly does have the most broad appeal, there's something here for everyone to enjoy. If you liked the two preceding films, I figure you'll love this one, I'm a fan of all three, this is my personal favourite.

It's a long movie, but it flies by at a canter, no single frame is wasted, it moves by at a terrific pace, it has incredible action sequences, but the story is terrific.

It's really interesting to see Batman coming in from a position where he's decided and feared, he's no longer accepted as Gotham's hero and saviour.

Christian Bale is the perfect Batman, and he is matched every step of the way by Tom Hardy. Hardy is off the charts as Bane, the last time we saw the character was back in The Batman and Robin film, perhaps best forgotten, here though he's an iconic villain.

I can't speak highly enough of Bale and Hardy, but this is also, I think the best of Anne Hathaway, she is excellent here.

A decade on, and this film is still fabulous.

10/10."
"Christopher Nolan's epic trilogy concludes in glorious fashion and gives us a thought provoking and suitably satisfying conclusion to an epic saga. It's emotional, intense and has a great villain in Tom Hardy."
"Not being a huge fan of superhero movies, I didn't have much expectations for Batman Begins. However viewing the 2005 Christopher Nolan production, I was pleasantly shocked. Then after my huge expectations for, ""The Dark Knight"", Christopher Nolan blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, ""The Dark Knight Rises""? Quite simply, Yes! My big expectations were once again, blown away. What a production! This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The editing, sound, score, visuals, direction and action are all top notch.

The film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Christian Bale, of course still makes is a great Batman. Michael Cain is fantastic, as he always is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be considered for an Oscar nomination. Tom Hardy as Bane is utterly terrifying, at times, and completely ominous. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman/Selina Kyle is a scene stealer. She is completely engrossing. Everyone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors are so well done, so well written, and so well directed. The Dark Knight Rises is is emotionally riveting and amazing to view.

At a running time of almost 3 hours, the film never becomes dull, which is pretty impressive. The movie's action sequences are spectacularly well created and very intense. The dialogue between the character's are intelligent and highly believable. The movie's soundtrack is terrific and really exemplify's many of the movie's scenes. Extremely well editing and sound use really develop many of the movie's action scenes, so it's not just explosions and visuals like in many other movies. Nolan creates a grand, dirty, engrossing world, and his action sequences just hum.

In conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that great writing and direction can enhance any movie-going experience, even superhero movies, which are usually thought of as mindless entertainment. I am wholly satisfied with Christopher Nolan's vision and thank all who worked on this film for bringing such an intricate interpretation of its very famous literary source. I cannot recommend this film anymore than I have, I just have to say everyone and anyone should see it. 10/10"""
"I think as a film stand point, the dark knight is a better movie that is better acted and tense the whole way through. The dark knight rises to me is a more fun and action filled movie that you can sit back a bit more. The acting is still amazing and combined with the atmosphere/visuals of the movie creates a the sense of realism that the movie has. That realism is where the intensity stems from throughout the movie, the audience believing that something like this could actually happen makes it that much scarier. Bane is also an excellent villain, in the dark knight the joker challenges Batman mentally but Bane physically challenges him which is a completely new challenge for Batman. The plot is incredible, it it starts fast and instantly brings you into the action. It then takes a step back to develop the characters further and build up the challenge Batman has to face. Once one of the many challenges was overcome by Batman in launches the viewer straight back into action for one epic final battle that lasts almost an hour......and it is GLORIOUS! Not one second was I bored, it is truly incredible how each movie in the trilogy is this good, it shouldn't be possible. I've not even mentioned the incredible soundtrack to compliment the astounding yet grounded action. I can't compliment this movie enough. If you haven't someone seen this trilogy yet....watch it, you won't be disappointed."
"I came out with slight disappointment after watching DKR for I had huge expectations from Nolan after an exceptional TDK.

I am huge fan of first two installment of Batman Trilogy. I liked DKR, it's a good movie, but it could have been much better.

So rather than discussing its merit, which are many, I am pointing out its shortcomings.

It's the weaker than other movies of trilogy and simple reason being it lacks strong characters. DKR is all about storytelling, just like Nolan's Inception, but not as efficient. And in doing so, it fails where Batman Begins and The Dark Knight had succeeded.

Batman Begins was all about fear, doubt, self-realization and redemption where Bruce Wayne discovers his destiny as Batman. BB had a story arc which set background for main characters - Batman / Wayne, Ra's al Ghul, Gordon (to some extent) and most importantly Gothom City and hence set stage for a fitting climax.

The Dark Knight explores the theme of chaos, morality and belief effortlessly and establishes characters of Joker, Harvey Dent/Two Face, Rachel etc. So effortlessly that people choose to ignore even some major plot holes. Heath Ledger's interpretation of Joker was so mesmerizing that it single handily carried TDK to path of greatness/ critical acclaim.

But Dark Knight Rises is all about story telling - efficient but not exceptional. Bane, Miranda Tate, John Blake, Peter Folly (Deputy Commissioner), Selina Kyle - characters are introduced but never explored/ expanded - they just start working on their part - just like cogs in the wheel. They are not so much part of the story itself but just the agents which move the story forward.

Bane's character is dull and single dimensional and do not evoke any fear or awe. He's meticulous, intelligent and strong and this is established quickly in movie but after that he slumps into a just another movie villain. Taila / Miranda character is never fully explored. Even Wayne/Batman is devoid of any emotions in this one and he feels so sure of himself that I start wondering if it's the same Batman that I saw in first two installments. Only new character which had some shades was that of Selina Kyle and Anne Hathaway did justice to it. Add to that helplessness of Alfred portrayed superbly by Caine. Other actors are good but there's not much for them to do.

There's no dilemma, choices, moral battles, hope, chaos or fear - things that make characters and plot interesting and which made Batman Begins and The Dark Knight really good movies. Even the theme of ""Occupy WallStreet"" is very weak and, at best, is closer to London riots with its looting and arson. There's even perfect order in Bane's revolution. Movie moves effortlessly from one plot to another and to climax that it become at times predictable.

But maybe Dark Knight Rises was supposed to be like that only and Nolan had too much to deal with in 2.5 hours. And maybe that's the main problem with DKR - too much is going on in the story that it seems crammed at times. And when there are too many characters and so many story arcs, it's tough to do justice to characters and story telling at the same time.

Dark Knight Rises have a good story but lacks strong characters and relies on Inception's style which incidentally differs from style of first two installments of Batman Trilogy.

And for me, soul of Nolan's Batman Series is its strong characters, their underlying emotions and a theme which is much deeper and meaningful than all fight, gadgetry and style. And this is where DKR fails.

6/10."
"Christopher Nolan has outdone himself with this one. At 3.30 in the morning, I was tired. Just getting out of it, I've never been so awake.

Perhaps what set this film apart from his other films was that it had a genuine emotional heartbeat. I felt that this was a flaw of Nolan's other films - the vision of emotion was there, but it was hollow. In this I bought it. I felt it, hero and villain alike.

Christian Bale was typically brilliant as Batman, and I felt that Bruce Wayne was more heavily embraced in this final installment. Bale added emotional depth to the character - a plot point that I think went astray in The Dark Knight - picking up from the development made in Batman Begins.

Tom Hardy as Bane was quite simply, terrifying. No longer a dunderhead ""enforcer"", but one of the criminal masterminds behind ""Gotham's Reckoning"", coupled with a physical dominance strong enough to send shivers down your spine.

Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle defied my expectations. Hands up who was not entirely convinced that that girl from the Princess Diaries could handle an intensely physical role like Catwoman. But here I am, hugely impressed. She added immeasurably to the value of the film.

Marion Cotillard fulfilled the role of Miranda Tate admirably, though I suspect this was the most underdeveloped character of the film - though after watching, I can see why.

The unsung hero of The Dark Knight Rises is Michael Caine as Alfred. A heartfelt performance that helps drive the emotional content of the film, helping Nolan sell his most well-rounded film to date. Caine's performance in both presence and absence.

Special mention goes to Joseph Gordon Levitt, who is consistently proving himself to be a big player in the Hollywood game. His role as officer Blake felt like there could've been more, but it may just have come all a bit much. It was a great performance, and Levitt sunk his teeth into role.

If you can, go see this in IMAX. If any film was to sell the format to skeptics, The Dark Knight Rises would be IT. I'm happy Nolan stuck to his guns and shot in 2D. 3D would have been unnecessary.

I suppose at this point, I have to turn my focus on Nolan. If he ever reads this... aspiring filmmaker to filmmaker, I've never been so envious, jealous in all my life. It's a film that leaves me floundering, wondering what I could possibly do to get anywhere near this ballpark. Well done. I think an Oscar Nomination is in order.

From here, I'm not sure what to expect of the future. Does our imagination carry us forward, or do the studios? Time will tell.

"I had the honor of watching TDKR during a screening and was completely blown away! Christopher Nolan's third film in his Batman trilogy doesn't disappoint. The movie is incredibly well made, its huge production is quite breathtaking to view. This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The movie's score high-lites many of its incredible scenes, and at times, it takes your breath away.

The film featured excellent performances, by all the cast. Christian Bale, as always is great as Batman. Anne Hathaway was completely engrossing, she became ""Catwoman"", just like Michele Pfeiffer did, although their interpretations were very different, both were equally effective. Tom Hardy was the main villain ""Bane"" completely shattered my expectations. One of the best superhero movie villains, I've ever seen. The terror caused by him, is completely believable and quite menacing. Marlion Cotilliard, Michael Cane, Gary Oldman, and others all did well in their respective roles. Now I know most will miss Heath Ledger as the Joker.(I know I do) I hope people don't compare Tom Hardy's performance to Heath Ledger's, its completely unfair and the two characters are very different. Just read the comics.

The colossal size of the film is a spectacle to behold, but surprisingly you don't get lost with all the explosions and extravagant action scenes, like in other films,(AKA Transformers, or POTC.) If one were to gripe, and I suppose there will never be a film made that one cannot find a point at which to grip, it is painfully long running time here. I found myself more worried about the pain in my posterior than the emotional final minutes after almost 3 hours that I had spent in a cramped seat, but that's just how I am. However the ending is just fantastic, so emotional and bring the trilogy to a very satisfying end.

Sorry if I'm being all fan-boyish and kissing this movie's behind, but I really admire it. It may not be among my personal favorites but generally this seems to be the movie event of this year. As a film though, this is amazing. A true lasting legacy in superhero story telling and summer-blockbusters."
"The best thing about this movie is how satisfying it is. It doesn't leave you frustrated or confused. You can't really complain that it didn't explore certain ideas or follow through. By deciding to have an official ending to this trilogy's story, the themes surrounding Batman are very fresh. We don't know where he'll end up. It's not the same old thing about whether he can continue to be Batman or not, which was already getting repetitive in Spider-man 2. The conclusions are not as important as the feelings they invoke as they come about. Nolan is especially good at capturing the complete tension of actually not knowing what will happen and deeply questioning what you *want* to happen and why.

This movie is bigger than the previous two, far more ambitious. There are no obvious annoying weaknesses that usually come with films in general, especially blockbuster action movies. All of Nolan's movies have deep psychological themes and this takes those in another new direction. I thought Inception was hugely original and insightful about the way people think. That level of abstraction and depth is present in this film. Bane bursts into it, his reputation is quickly established. Nolan uses people's expectations and anticipation to the fullest. We are left to wonder about what has happened in the 8 years since the events of The Dark Knight. Why have the characters become the way they are now?

In the latter half, it does seem like the movie is trying to pull off so many different plot points and connections, but they all work. The cast is very large and impressive. You don't see ""good acting"". You see fascinating characters. They're just playing their part in the grand story that's being crafted. There are many unfamiliar faces but they all have a strange, unique look to them. We often see a person's flaws and previous decisions coming back to haunt them. They find out the hard way what mistakes they have made. Where their limits are. Where they lose control.

The score is almost tribal, very raw and energetic. You don't get much chance to pay attention to it but many parts of the movie are pounding with excitement. There are countless quotable lines and disturbing slices of dialogue. They cut deep. The Joker was a great character and this is a very different movie but the themes are just as dark, only perhaps indirectly. Underneath, it's very sinister. Writing and efficiency appear to be among Nolan's greatest strengths. The story has many layers that interweave and apparently they came in under budget.

Perhaps the most important thing about Catwoman is that she's completely believable. When she beats up men, you don't roll your eyes. She's feminine and powerful in her own way. She fits into the world and we completely understand her motivations. She doesn't have a huge role but a very important one.

I didn't find myself moved but maybe I'm too cynical. I was more affected psychologically. Curious about humanity and all the different sides of it you see in this movie. It goes to many extremes. I felt humbled by my complete lack of life experience. What do I know about anything? How could I possibly understand half of the characters? I haven't been through anything or achieved anything compared to most of them. Michael Caine gets a bigger role this time. He was always critical but this time he's very much the emotional core.

I thought Christian Bale was overlooked in The Dark Knight especially. The movies hinge on him. Bruce Wayne's just a man but also incredibly inspirational. Bale's famous for completely committing to his roles and it pays off. Tom Hardy is impressive as Bane but I suppose that's no surprise. The rest of the leads are similarly awesome. There are many references to the earlier films. Very few questions are left unanswered. It's always nice when film-makers really think it through and make an actual decision and get all the details right.

So anyway, I'll miss Batman (since the trilogy has ended) but couldn't have hoped for a better, more epic and sincere finale to his story."
"The Batman series by Christopher Nolan was and is probably one of the best superhero series ever. In an industry where very few sequels have been that good, The Dark Knight, I believe was designed by Christopher Nolan to be head and shoulders above Batman Begins; and it was. The Dark Knight surpassed Batman Begins, end of story. Now that you have accomplished what very few have managed, how do you surpass this one. A daunting and mountainous task indeed. Only now, Nolan wasn't even trying to surpass it. He was merely trying to present a movie that would build on its predecessor.

The movie is set 8 years after the Joker incident so that anything related to the Joker need not be shown (RIP Heath Ledger). Nolan presents us a completely different Gotham. A different take on it. And how 8 years can change people. How the harvey dent and joker incident can affect people and batman himself. In a time of peace, it is quite easy to plan and attack even an entire city. Everything is taken into concern. And it all adds up to one seemingly invincible villain. The logic is never lost at any point of time. The screenplay is penned to allow the impact of what has happened to Gotham and its people in ""The Dark Knight"" and what could happen if something goes wrong now.

All things said, if you are expecting something better than The Dark Knight, you are mistaken. This was never going to compete or surpass that. This is a very good movie in its own right. As for the series, there cannot be a better conclusion and I really hope nobody else continues this series if Nolan decides not to.

TDKR needs to be appreciated for staying true to its roots and still giving us something good, exhilarating and unexpected."
"There are plenty of elements that made this film work, so I suppose we can tick them off one by one. For starters, the continuation on the focus of Bruce Wayne's story, which has made it all tick. This version of Bruce Wayne and Alfred become the familiar characters we're accustomed with since 2005, and the film invests heavily on the emotional bonding between the two, which deals back to the theme about fear that rears its ugly head again, and how a father figure cannot stand idly by to watch the one he brought up recklessly charge into battle after a long hiatus, and hoping for a life of normalcy with the mantle of the bat given up. Michael Caine may have a shorter screen time than before, but no less powerful.

When Sam Raimi had to put the popular and powerful Venom into Spider-man 3 pretty much against his wishes, we all knew how that turned out to be, effectively killing off the franchise until the decision to reboot it. There may be some similar fears with the introduction of a fairly contemporary villain in Bane, but the story gave him more purpose and meaning, and Tom Hardy was excellent par none in this role as the compete villain - with plenty of brawn, merciless, masterful, and with a plan any terrorist would be proud of. If the Scarecrow meant to induce fear, and the Joker to create chaos, Bane is carnage incarnate. Tom Hardy, even being the requisite mask, is fearful, and while the designs of his plan may dwarf the Joker's in complexity, it sure rivaled his in terms of delivery, and execution. Anyone in his path gets shoved aside with deadly consequences, and anyone alive is only because there is of further use. No hesitation, and no compromise.

And Nolan continues with the introduction of a lot more villains big and small, behind a mask or otherwise, in his Bat films than anyone would credit him for, especially when having those whose lines are blurred, or corrupt to the core and hiding behind social status and fortune. This in turn provides for another arc that boils underneath the main narrative, where the rich and powerful continue to enjoy their successes at the expense of the have-nots, and the Occupy Movement in a way being a very real parallel to the proceedings on screen. While the mobsters were clearly at the top of the food chain in the earlier Nolan films, this one shifted focus to politicians and the elite community, with their fair share of scandals and corporate greed.

While Bane was to the point, Selina Kyle played by Anne Hathaway, is both sensual and a force to be reckoned with herself, being like how she's best portrayed, on the fence. There's a bit of Frank Miller's Year One in this one given the presence of Juno Temple's Holly, and the back to basics as a jewel thief, compared to the mousy secretary in Tim Burton's Batman Returns with Michelle Pfeiffer defining the role, and the garbage that was Halle Berry's. Anne Hathaway nailed this one with what would be a truly memorable outing, and as if a homage of sorts to Burton's second Batman film, that the repartee between Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle at a party became one of the highlights here, as does her thievery and combat ability. She may lack her whip, but more than makes up for it with her steel stiletto heels, and the very sensual and sleekly designed feline moves that you'd wonder how they got delivered while wrapped under that skin tight suit.

And not only is the technology put on screen fictionally impressive, the technical aspects behind the scenes also worked wonders, chalking up serious mileage in having more than an hour's worth of footage shot on the IMAX format. Wally Pfister's cinematography continues to impress with that staying consistent to the gritty look and feel developed for all the Bat films to date, before his departure into a film director's role for his next project. Hans Zimmer also probably developed the best score for Nolan's Bat films, and I dare say without which this film would be less stellar, with the score playing a huge role in adding plenty of character and emotion to the film, lifting it up with excitement during the many set action pieces, with recognizable themes assigned to major players, heightening dangers, and providing a boost to the many feelings in this one heck of an action-adventure.

With how things developed at the end, and what I felt was initial horror of sorts with Batman out in broad daylight, secret identity being porous and all, this film ended in what would be the best way possible - with possibilities, and a twinkle of an eye, Inception style with a did it, or did it not. Twists, turns, surprises and sleight of hand, making it a clear favourite as one of the best this year. Do yourself a favour and watch it in the IMAX format, just as it was intended.

Because you have just got to believe in Christopher Nolan, and the kind of films he has so far delivered. Take a bow, bat-crew, for a trilogy that has now set the bar for any comic book film, and especially any other follow Batman movie, reboot or otherwise, to live up to."
"I'm going to start off by saying that this was probably one of my most anticipated movies of all time. I went in the theater hoping for a masterpiece. I actually expected this movie to jump into my top five of all time. It didn't disappoint, I loved it.

The opening scene had me questioning what exactly was going on. Movies that make you think about the smallest details of the plot are my favorite. In the scene the audience is introduced to the new villain, Bane. As a kid watching cartoons I always thought that bane was a mindless hulk-like bad guy. In this movie he has a true to the comic's portrayal. He's smart, he has a plan, and he'll stop at nothing to put it into action. Much like Dark Knight, the Villain is a major standout. He has such an intimidating presence on screen. Tom Hardy put so much work into the physicality of the character. The first fight between Bane and Batman is one of the moments that they had to get right. Luckily it's one of my favorite moments in the entire film! In the scene they don't use too much sound, just Bane's taunts as he fights, truly frightening. His voice is so interesting. It's something you'll really remember about the film. After the film my friends and I couldn't help but do Bane impressions. He has so many quotable lines that he will probably be one of my favorite villains of all time. You might be wondering if he outperformed the Joker from Dark Knight. The answer is no, not quite. He's so different of a character it's hard to compare, but Joker was just too hard to beat. Christian Bale's performance as Batman and Bruce Wayne was amazing. This was easily his best performance as Batman. The story takes place eight years after the end of Dark Knight so Bruce is feeling the ill effects of being batman. He uses a cane now, and he has a little grey hair. This is a story about Bruce Wayne coming back, and doing anything he can for his city. Bruce and Alfred have some amazing scenes where you forget your watching acting. The emotion they both convey when they're together is stunning. Michel Cane doesn't have as much screen time as he does in the other movies, but he's so good in the ones he's in you won't forget his performance. Morgan Freeman is back. He has some particularly funny scenes with Bruce. They feel like old friends yet again. You really can't go wrong with any of the actors in this movie. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays young police officer Blake. He has some great character development during the course of the movie. I was cheering for him the whole time. If you come out of this movie saying ""I just wish it had better acting"" I'd question your sanity. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman was one big worry I had about the movie going in. Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised. She did a great job of portraying the playful vigilante. She actually had okay chemistry with Christian Bale. Catwoman wasn't forced into the story, her character made sense within the plot. She didn't ruin the movie, which was all I was asking for. Plus, she actually looked like she could fight. She wasn't doing the ""I'm a woman who can beat up ten men with one hand tied behind my back"" routine. It was such a relief that they didn't try to do something annoying like Black Widow from Avengers.

The story was fantastic. It's amazing that Christopher Nolan wasn't planning on doing this movie before he made Batman Begins. There are so many callbacks and references to that movie I would strongly recommend watching that one again before you see this one. I kept saying ""Oh I remember when he said that!"" or thinking ""That ties in perfectly"". This one had plenty of twists and turns. Multiple times I was questioning what was true and what was a clever ruse. If there are any negatives, you might say there are some plot leaps. Not holes mind you, but something upon thinking about it you might consider a little unbelievable. With such huge story and scope I'm surprised there aren't more mistakes. The scale of this movie is far bigger than in either of the first two Batman movies. Bane has a plan for all of Gotham and batman has to stop an entire city of villains. The entire trilogy comes to a very fitting finish. I absolutely loved the ending. I was very satisfied how everything tied together. I especially loved the conclusion of Bruce's story, perfect. When I came out of the theater I couldn't wait to discuss the amazing things that happened in the end. This is a movie where the more you watch it the more you'll understand and enjoy it.

Of course, in the conclusion to a trilogy like this one you would expect to be dazzled by the special effects. They were quite impressive. The new batwing has some pretty amazing aerial maneuvers. You definitely get your money's worth with the cinematography. The opening and ending scenes especially stand out. There was an extremely cool Bat Pod driving scene that, as soon as it was over, I wanted to watch it again.

It can't tell you enough that this was an amazing movie. It was certainly the best of the year. If you're wondering if it's better than The Dark Knight I honestly can't say. Time will tell. It could be better, and that's some of the highest praise I can give it.

Edit: Time did tell. It didn't hold up. Still good. Nowhere near Dark Knight tkubas1.wordpress.com."
"'The Dark Knight Rises' is the third and final instalment in Christopher Nolan's groundbreaking trilogy that reshaped the superhero genre as we know it. The main cast return as well as some newcomers. Tom Hardy as 'Bane', Anne Hathaway as 'Selina', Joseph Gordon-Levitt as 'Blake' and Marion Cotillard as 'Miranda'. The new additions are fantastic, especially Tom Hardy. He brings a menacing presence to the character and finally incorporates the main part of his comic counterpart, his brains. For sure Bane is incredibly strong, but he is also an unbelievable strategist that can systematically wear down Batman whilst also using his strength to defeat him. Hardy displays all of this perfectly despite us barely seeing his face, the mask he wears makes him more frightening and is used as an interesting plot device later in the film. A lot of people criticised the voice that Hardy uses for this character, but personally I love it, I think adds to the mystery of the figure. The best acting comes from Michael Caine as 'Alfred Pennyworth'. Nolan really fleshes out Alfred and Bruce's relationship in this film and Caine plays the reluctant mentor figure perfectly. One of his final scenes really shows off his acting, the regret that Alfred pours out and it's heartbreaking. Whilst all of the other actors are great, Caine excels in this movie compared to 'Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight'. The writing is brilliant, so many twists and turns and a sensational ending that really brings the trilogy full circle and has a great ending to Bruce's arc. The dialogue is excellent, in particular the many Bane monologues that add another layer onto his great character. The fight choreography improves massively and is loads better than the last two films. Hanz Zimmers score is superb and works in all scenes that it features in. Also, the cinematography is beautiful, Wally Pfister, who has worked with Nolan throughout the trilogy, really peaks in this picture. However, this movie isn't perfect, Bane's final demise is very underwhelming, especially for a character that makes as much of an impact as he does. Finally the twist at the end with Blake feels tacked on and is inaccurate to the source material. Overall, I love this movie, for sure it doesn't live up to the heights of 'The Dark Knight' but it is still exceptional and was a stunning way to end this unbelievable series of films.

"Let me start by saying, that I am an avid Nolan admirer. Up until now I haven't seen a bad Nolan film. All of his movies would be in my top movies list if I had one, I consider him a genius. After seeing the final act of his Batman I have started to reconsider.

The movie was filled with moments where I found myself thinking ""This is not believable"" and after the first hour I asked myself ""Is this it?"". Gladly after the first hour things did become more meaningful. The ""fall"" of the dark knight was awesome, Bane was a tough guy and the Batman did suffer. It was great. Even Anne Hathaway came trough crushing all my negative preconceptions. Other than that, the movie certainly didn't deliver.

In the end they ruined Banes character. Batman's training in this film was far from believable. There were lot of little stories and story structures going on, which didn't work when added together. I mean they worked but comparing to the previous films of Nolan they certainly did not deliver. In many scenes I thought ""This is something that just could not happen"", the things in this film just didn't work. And I don't mean Batman doing his stunts, of course they are unrealistic, I mean all the little things that left me bothered.

On the other hand when it comes to Batman's stunts there were little, the end conclusion left me thinking ""was this the great finale of BATMAN?"". Isn't Batman supposed to do something cooler than fly a plane or ride a motorcycle? Isn't Batman supposed to be an acrobat who beats everyone in a cool, cunning and mysterious ways? Here he was the operator of an army plane. In the previous films he was Batman, in this film he doesn't really come off as Batman. His only a random commando wearing a Batman suit. This is something I could not forgive Nolan for.

If the scenes we're actually believable I would've propably considered forgiving him this error, but these two errors together are just too much for me to say this is an impressive movie. You might be able to go as far to say this is good, but it is not impressive. This is a shame, because the guy who did this has done nothing but impressive movies. For some other director this movie could be a good stepping stone for something better, an acceptable movie that did have its moments, but for Nolan it is an utter failure. There we're times in this movie when he got me and I was impressed. The movie did in certain scenes raise my emotion and hit me where it should've, but as a whole taking into account all the bad things it cannot be regarded as a movie above others.

I was let down with this movie. With all of his previous movies that I have seen in the theathre I have gone in with enormous expectations, like the kind of hyped mind you should never walk in with and every single time I have walked out with my expectations blown away by the grandness of what I have just seen. This time I walked in with the same expectations and came out disappointed. The only question in my mind being ""How was he able to not see these flaws in this movie, I thought he was a genius who could not fail""."
"This movie shows that despite failure, despite your fears, despite your enemies, you can be a hero. you can use all three of those things to your advantage and become something better than you were before you encountered them. it masterfully shows and tells that ANYONE can be a hero.

obviously on a technical level this film is perfect. almost the entirety of the third act is shot in beautiful imax, that's sadly only in 16:9 on 4K. just like with the previous transfers, sound and picture are great, but this is probably the best looking film to me.

it may not seem like it at first, but just like ra's and joker, bane is the opposite side of the same coin for batman. tom hardy perfectly embodies bane and the darkness, and obviously he's a downgrade from joker, but that doesn't mean he's not the perfect villain for a finale.

hans zimmer delivers probably my third favorite score from him, with an incredible theme for bane as well as many extensions of previous themes.

this is such an underrated finale. all three films mesh together so well, they feel like one. they mean so much to me, and i'll forever thank nolan for making these films."
"I've always loved superhero movies and as a kid Batman was my favourite superhero and I collected as many of the comic books as I could possibly afford.

Saying that I've never expected a superhero movie to be between the best genres of movies that I would ever watch. I just expect them to be entertaining and something fun to watch. I watch most of them; Superman, Spiderman, Ironman, X-men etc.

I expected the same this time but I was knocked off my feet. The actors, the storyline, the manuscript and the filming just came together as one of the best movies I've ever seen. This movie has really brilliant and powerful dialogues.

If you haven't seen it yet then I can strongly recommend it. I will definitely see it again with a good bottle of wine and popcorn. Enjoy!"
"Christopher Nolan's stunning conclusion to his Batman trilogy is a welcome return to form after the slightly overrated THE DARK KNIGHT, which was so obsessed with being all dark and brooding that it forgot to tell much of a story. Despite the presence of a much-hyped (and lamented) Heath Ledger in the cast, I found that film to be less entertaining than BATMAN BEGINS although it still remains an engaging and watchable film. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES (horrible title, by the way), though, blows it out of the water, offering a piece of sheer spectacle that's as involving and as tightly-plotted as you could wish for.

It's eight years since the last film, and Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne is nowadays retired and definitely feeling his age. Before long, though, a hulking brute of a bad guy (Tom Hardy, whose sheer physicality in the role will surprise nobody who's seen Bronson) decides to do some very unpleasant things in the city, so it's time to dust off the bat suit and get back into the action. Good news for the viewer.

As usual, Nolan surpasses the conventions of his genre, making this a superhero film that looks nothing like a superhero film, instead more like a modern-day epic of dramatic cinema. Yes, at the end of the day it's still about suited guys beating the hell out of each other, and Nolan once again relies on old conventions/clichés (such as the 'ticking bomb' trope, which he's repeated in his last three films now) to see him through, but everyone runs so well and so smoothly that you end up not minding.

The cast is thorough and involved as ever, Bale as usual going the extra mile to portray the tortured hero and Caine lending emotional support as Alfred. Hardy's villain is a sheer powerhouse who dominates every scene he's in, and Nolan brings back a couple of his favourites from INCEPTION (Marion Cotillard and Joseph Gordon-Levitt) for good measure. There's not quite as much action as you might expect from a film of this type, but the storyline is so involved that you don't care. Throw plenty of stunning special effects into the mix and you have a real crowd-pleaser of a film with real brain as well as brawn."
"Chris Nolan has r-e-a-l-l-y outdone himself again this time. An amazing story that I don't even know who else could write such a treatment on the World's Greatest Detective, the crowning glory of Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy.

I remember I once made a joke to myself a long while ago about him that if he was going to make another movie, he would probably cast Heath Ledger and Joseph Gordon-Levitt's respective love interests from a movie of which they BOTH starred in and worked on-- 10 Things I Hate About You.

It would be ironically funny how both actors are connected to each other from working at different times with the ""holy-moly mind-blowing"" filmmaker and that the actresses that played their love interests would possibly too as well."
"I'll be brutally honest here. I liked The Dark Knight better than this. Even though its just couple of hours since I finished watching it.

Sure, TDK had its flaws, but then, it was such a marvelous noir saga, a treatise in crime drama that left us begging for more at the end. The phrase ""page-turner"" is often applied to engrossing books, but that could work just as well for the magnificent film. To this day, I cannot take my eyes off whenever I see TDK and by the time that ravishing interrogation scene between Batman and Joker is on, nothing is likely to stir me from my seat. By choosing to make the titular character undergo a perception shift, a massive (and ultimately successful) gamble was taken. And who can forget the late, great Heath Ledger's spectacular performance?

TDKR is not a bad movie per se. Seen alone, it has the ideal ingredients for a summer blockbuster: an A-list cast, monumental action sequences, modern themes of terrorism and official ineptitude, as well as intricate sub-plots which mesh well together at the end. There is more than a passing reference to the predecessors, especially Batman Begins (which, in my humble opinion, is an enormously underrated flick). And it works to a great extent.

Where this film fails as TDK succeeded is in the amount of layering. Some sub-plots were so complex that I was left confused as to where I was before that particular sequence (case in point: Blake's impromptu reconnaissance of a dockyard). Others were left frustratingly hanging in thin air. The plot also seems slow paced at first. While the first sequence is downright awesome, what follows afterward is distinctly underwhelming. Above all else, Batman is renowned to be a master strategist. Here, he ends up getting deceived not once, but twice at Catwoman's hands. You mean to tell me that eight years is good enough to make a superbly trained, marine-worthy, genius escape artist-cum-detective become dull? Really?

I won't go ahead and slate Nolan more here, simply because he gave me the privilege of watching two of the best superhero movies ever filmed in Batman Begins and TDK. The glass is always half-full in my eyes, and I'll admit that Hathaway and Gordon-Levitt were both perfect selections for their roles. I'm not too sure of Tom Hardy, since his performance is more physical than metaphorical but given his task was to exude a ruthless menace, he did his job. The rest of the familiar supporting cast are brilliant as before, especially with Caine showing his human side that we always suspected was well alive beneath that stiff British upper lip exterior and dry wit. I read somewhere that this is not a Batman movie, but a Bruce Wayne movie. And I fully agree. Having to reconcile (with unflattering results) with a life without Batman, Bruce is alone even as a social presence and a corporate figure. It is a true challenge but then again, Christian Bale turned in a remarkable performance in both BB and TDK (he held his own in those scenes where Ledger was not present). And in TDKR, he leaves an indelible mark on a role that would probably be the benchmark.

Batman Begins was all about ""Fear"" while ""Chaos"" was a running theme in TDK. TDKR does a great job in being a conclusion to the trilogy, but it is not the best one among the three, probably because there is no strong undercurrent of a theme here."
"I am a huge fan of Christopher Nolan and the first 2 Dark Knight movies, so I had high expectations for this movie. The Dark Knight Rises is good, but it is nowhere near the level of the other two movies. It has several things that are a bit cliché and it also had several plot holes that I found very irritating and distracting. My friend who I saw it with initially thought it was the best out of the trilogy, but after we discussed the plot holes that he missed, he ranked it as the worst of the three movies. Throughout the movie I felt like everything was a bit overdone. It seemed like they were trying so hard to make the ""epic conclusion"" that they forgot to make it realistic or reasonable. One of the things I loved about the first two was how it dealt with Batman in a fairly realistic way. There was a fairly good overview of how he functioned and how he was viewed. In this I thought there was much less dealing with the separation of Bruce Wayne and Batman, which was one of the interesting parts of the first 2. Also, I would describe the main character of The Dark Knight Rises as Bruce Wayne rather than Batman, which I found greatly disappointing. Still a good movie, but not nearly as great as the first 2."
"-Minor Spoilers- First of all, why hate so much? The movie is not perfect, agreed. It's not the best movie ever, again agreed. However it's one of the best movies, and it's pretty damn good, even if it's not perfect. The plot is good, the action is good, cast is great, acting is great too, and the atmosphere the movie creates is fantastic! Ignore all the hate, and please go enjoy the film. And I don't understand, why are people comparing this movie to TDK? They're by the same director and they're part of the same trilogy, no comparison. TDK is too perfect, and we all know that. So why did ya all have your expectations sky high. Whenever a director releases a movie which is near-perfect, then it is hard for him/her to beat that movie. Sure he/she can make a movie equal to the other one, but to beat it, think again. Thus my expectations for TDKR were high, but not sky high. And guess what? It crossed my expectations, and it was really close to TDK. Tremendous film!

Lately I haven't developed an interest in comic book reading, and I really don't enjoy batman or to be honest I don't enjoy much of superhero films at all. Only a few. However I didn't only enjoy this movie as a superhero film, I also enjoyed it itself as a movie. The reason I don't watch many superhero films is because they're very tedious and repetitive, and there's no message. Here is how your everyday superhero film goes ""There is ""Whatever"" man. Some stupid person attempts to outsmart the _____man, and take over the city, and guess what? He fails, and ______ man gets respect for saving the city...the end"". TDKR was out of the ordinary. To be honest, the whole trilogy was ""Out of the box"" thinking, especially this and TDK. Both this and TDK made it to my Top 10 films of all-time, and many movies at this time don't even make it close.

The movie did have its problems as well, it was not perfect. One of the major concerns was the time. The movie had a near-3hr run time which was more than enough. There were some slow and boring parts at the beginning and middle of the film, but as the movie approached the ending, none of this really mattered. Also I didn't really like how Bane died. He was really bad-ass up until the end, where Catwoman whipped him out in 1 second. I was expecting another fight between Batman and Bane, only to find out something else? It was too fast of a death, and not only that, he was the villain of the film, how can you kill a villain in 1 second? And it was not even Batman who killed him, it was Catwoman? I personally wasn't expecting this at all.

-Major Spoilers- The movie really kept you glued to the screen near the end. I really liked the plot twists and never expected some of them. Though some were predictable, but others weren't, IMO. For example, Batman surviving, and Talia escaping from the prison rather than Bane was pretty unpredictable. On the other hand, John Black turning out to be Robin, and Miranda Tate turning out to be Talia al Ghul was more predictable. I think there were some more plot twists, but I can't really remember, because I saw the full movie once, and that was 3 months back.

At first I thought Bane was the one who escaped from the prison, and was the son of Henri Ducard, but it turned out that it was Talia, and Bane was just a friend. This was the real shocker for me. I didn't really care much for the other plot twists, but this really shook me hard. I never expected this, in fact I even forgot about this up until the end. Also batman surviving? This was the second most unpredictable twist. At first I thought just maybe he survived, but after the funeral, I was sure that he was dead. Then he appears in Florence? This was pretty shocking as well.

The second half of the film was the best, because that's when the excitement began. I was very curious about what was going to happen next. After the explosion scenes, the suspense began to rise rapidly. Then the climax came all together very nicely.

My favourite parts of the film in the first half were the opening ""Plane Hijack"" scene, the ""Stock Exchange"" scene, and ""Bane vs Batman"" fight 1. In the second half my favourite scenes were the ""Football explosion"" scene, ""Bane vs Batman"" fight 2, and the final chase scene. Some of the other fight scenes involving Catwoman and Robin were pretty good too.

Final thoughts, I didn't expect much of this movie after TDK. TDK was perfect, and I thought this movie would be no where close, but it was pretty damn close. It was really good too. The action was great. The cast, acting, and dialogue were all fantastic. Especially the dialogue between Alfred and Bruce. Gary Oldman did a great job, not to mention that Joseph Gordon-Levitt did an amazing job as well. Tom Hardy turned out to be a great villain. Even though Bane's voice was kind of confusing, but it was pretty cool. Overall the whole movie includes some great action scenes, and runs a full circle completing TDK legend in an Epic way!

Final Rating 9/10."
"Christopher Nolan has out done himself again, striking not just Batman fans, but fans of the series and movie goers everywhere with his beautifully crafted, last installment of The Dark Knight trilogy, The Dark Knight Rises. The acting has always been well done in the last two, but something about the last one really made me feel the performances were real, quite like the late Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker. The movie ran about two hours and forty-five minutes give or take, but I never wanted it to end. The story progression never seemed to drag on, the movie always kept me on the edge of my seat. This is one that will be an all time favorite of mine, and a true classic.

"I can't express in words of how amazing this movie is. All I have to say is go watch it for yourself.the is really the best,don't get me wrong i enjoyed the others but this one truly takes the cake!I said before batman begins is the best film i had ever seen without any exception. However viewing the 2005 Christopher Nolan production, I was pleasantly shocked. Then after my huge expectations for, ""The Dark Knight"", Christopher Nolan blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, ""The Dark Knight Rises""? Quite simply, Yes! My big expectations were once again, blown away. What a production! This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The editing, sound, score, visuals, direction and action are all top notch.I am wholly satisfied with Christopher Nolan's vision and thank all who worked on this film for bringing such an intricate interpretation of its very famous literary source.a big kiss for Christian Bale and Anne Hathaway i really love them.if i visit USA this will be for visit Christian Bale and Anne Hathaway. thanks for all."
"Christopher Nolan was assigned with the job of coming out with a new Batman movie comparable to The Dark Knight. Did he succeed? In short, yes. Is it better than The Dark Knight? No. But is it incredible, awesome, and everything we could have hoped for? Yes. This movie would be the best Batman movie and even one of the best movies ever if Heath Ledger wouldn't have put on the face paint. That's what I think is the biggest difference between the movies. While Tom Hardy's Bane is very very well done and flat out frightening at times, nobody can top Ledger's Joker. But don't think for a second that TDKR is any worse because of that.

The Dark Knight Rises brings the biggest threat of all three movies to Gotham in the form of Bane. Bane is Batman's biggest threat he's ever had physically and forces Bruce Wayne to return as Batman after entering an isolated state. Much less happens in this movie than in the previous two and I think it's because of the villains. In Batman Begins, Batman had to fight the Mob, Scarecrow, and Ras Al Ghul. In The Dark Knight, Batman had to fight the Mob, The Joker, and Two-Face. In The Dark Knight Rises, Batman has to fight Bane, and only Bane. From beginning to end, all Batman has to do is figure out how to defeat Bane and stop him from finishing his evil plot. While Batman Begins is some what lessened in genius because it has to tell the origin story of Batman, and The Dark Knight is just obviously amazing to everyone who sees it, The Dark Knight Rises has more of a hidden genius. Most people will miss all the symbols and why this movie is so brilliant and such a masterful ending to the Dark Knight's Legacy.

There's so much I wish I can say, but I don't want to spoil it for you. All I should say is see it. See it and be amazed by it. 10 Stars out of 10."
Gotham's reckoning.Well TDKR the last installment of the Nolan's Batman series ended in the perfect note the way trilogies are a supposed to end the real trilogy. So whats so great about this movie? This movie has it own moments when you get the chills on several occasions about whats is going to happen next it is almost breathtaking.Brilliant performances by all the actors in the movie.Hans Zimmer did it again by making the perfect score for the movie which will glue you to the seat and a wonderful plot which brings justice to the entire series. But but there is a but there are a few things which i felt should have been how it was which I am not going to mention because this needs to be a spoiler free review and i want it to be but this movie is worth every penny. Is this movie better than The Dark Knight? Well to that I have to think about it I cant sum up to the conclusion yet but again for me Batman Begins revolves around Batman The Dark Knight about the people of Gotham TDKR well why are you still reading this go watch it for yourself as i said it was worth every dime ...
"As a huge fan of superhero movies and undeniably the batman Christopher Nolan has depicted is the favourite of my choice. He is humane yet enigmatic, heroic and self-giving. Chris Nolan has produced superhero movies into a whole different level. The action, acting, sound and other visual effects was absolutely mind-blowing for the previous two productions. He is good at picking the right cast playing the right role like Michael Caine, Gary Oldham and Morgan Freeman who have always been the linchpin behind the success of the movie. I am also in awe of his previous works excluding the batman series such as Momento and The Prestige. So I had high hope and expectation on the Dark Knight Rises of how the director can build up the finale of the Batman trilogy which the world has long anticipated this blockbuster.

Judged by the content of the trailers, lots of people might expect it to be an action intensive film with lots of explosive elements and the elemental conflict between good and evil. If I'm honest, I have already seen most of the action scenes of the movie via the trailers before watching the film which is a saddening thing to hear from an audience's point of view. The entire film was almost three hours long and there were way too much chit chatting with the whole conspiracy by the villain but not getting down into the main point or the action bits. I think those scenes about having trials on the people by the judge whether they were guilty or not was plainly farcical in my opinion and quite cheesy which I never experienced in the previous two batman films.

The Dark Knight Rises has put in a lot of new characters who played a key role in the film including Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing John Blake and Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate. But the main villain, Bane played by Tom Hardy made me anticipated on how he can use his eyes as his weapon to proceed the acting, to show his wrath towards the corrupted society. I must say I was a bit disappointed at the villain role as the joker simply played too well in The Dark Knight in which Tom Hardy could not exceed the expectation. With those prestigious casts which all of them are great actors, I expected that it would be a sensational experience crafted by those actors. However, the entire film always talking about bits and bobs and never really get to one main theme. The experience was messy and too stuffed in without much focus to cause the audience to fall into the frictional world that Christopher Nolan was trying to present.

In conclusion, The Dark Knight Rises does not exceed my expectation nor better than the predecessor. I thought it was a let down the way how Christopher Nolan wrap up this impeccable Batman series. I only gave the rating 7/10 because of the two fantastic previous productions he made."
"The Dark Knight Rises (2012) The crusader in the mask For the last few years cinematography and special effects took a big step in improving the quality of their own products. That's why every new film set the bar higher and higher, therefor competition is rising. However, this is what exactly people want. Today once again saw this movie and decided to share my point of view, because while it is almost 3 years old, nevertheless with every time watching this film is no less mesmerizing.

In my opinion the plot of the third part surpassed even the second with loved by all great Heath Ledger as the Joker. It is very interesting and confusing, and if the beginning of the film (as is a rule in the case with Cristofer Nolan) is pretty tight, by the end of it is already impossible to put down. Eight years after the events of the previous part Gotham lives in piece and silence. Police Commissioner James Gordon feels guilty about covering up Harvey Dant's crimes and Dark Knight's disappearing because of that. However, events occurring in the city for the last days cry for help the hero, as well as the beauty who has got into trouble – Cat Woman. So Batman dares to speak out against the main villain – Bane. Christopher Nolan - a man who showed how the movie can be removed on comics. Already, it makes him one of the best producers nowadays. As he said, for the first Batman movie the main theme was ""fear"", for the second - ""chaos"", for the last - ""pain"". This pain is more soulful and Bruce Wayne will feel it completely.

Christian Bale – a man always on his top. For the late 80's and 90's kids he will always be the Dark Knight. Christian Bale is my Batman. He is my hero.

Anne Hathaway - a perfect Cat Woman. She is my favorite actress and she didn't disappoint me. It costs a lot. Joseph Gordon-Levitt played the role of energetic young cop - Blake. It seems this guy have a bright future, because Joseph is showing cool actor's skills. Morgan Freeman,

Gary Oldman and Michael Caine showed that ""old"" doesn't mean ""bad"". An incredible full compliance with the allotted roles. Soundtrack. «Basara Deshi» permeates the entire history by becoming the theme both for Bane and Batman.

I can say with certainty that the film was a success. Nice plot and amazing special effects because of the big budget are doing their job. Strong main villain who are all the time winning good guys causes the audience worry and fear. However, like rays are trying to break through the clouds, good is trying to break through. All this and beautiful Anne Hathaway don't give the audience to look away from the screen. Many of the best characters in the Batman universe, as if in a mirror, reflect the character of the protagonist, or when walking on the razor's edge between justice and revenge, or when caught in a trap of injuries in the past. Loyal fans of comics hardly surprised many plot twists, which is quite natural if we remember how the story developed in detail. For truly impressive how Nolan and his co-authors-screenwriter David S. Goyer and Jonathan Nolan managed to finish the trilogy of Batman. The film seems to be more emotional than the second part with it's psychological games. Of course, it has a lot of drama and even tragedy as well, but ""Dark Knight Rises"" touches the most. This large-scale painting, remaining harmonious, with great music and very beautiful camera work. However, the scope and action, going beyond imagination, leads to the fact that the scene, each of which is costs more than the budget of any other film, are perceived as ordinary events, while Bruce Wayne looks better in private moments, whether it's the episode where one of the characters finally realizes who is actually a man- bat, or the scene with the advent of a new character. Also there is a problem with the female audience understanding the reality of the plot, because there a lot of moments related to the previous parts. For example, such an important character of the first part and Batman story as Ras'el'Gul, whose name was named in a few episodes of the movie. Everyone should see this picture, are you a child or adult, it does not matter whether you love comics knight in black armor or you don't. Everyone who will leave the cinema will be inspired by something. Your brain processes speed up and you will feel strong and ready for new challenges. No matter where you are, who you are, when you are. What is important is that the message is delivered to you and it's your business what to do with it. Nolan and Co. did what they wanted to do. Created a symbol. Created a hero. My hero.

Score: 10 out of 10 Batmans"
"A feline fingerer has taken to your pearls, although identity's the intent of this girl, as she initiates engagement, allows the stirring of assuagement, the final chapter is prepared, starts to unfurl. A villain name of Bane brings down an empire, an exchange leads to a tomb, so deep and dire, a saviour's weaponised, the population terrorised, Ra's al Ghul's destructive end, is the desire. But there are those who can align and form resistance, as you recover your resolve and your persistence, as the endgame twists and turns, a web of intrigue is discerned, and you race to save the day and create distance."
"There's a common misconception when it comes to The Dark Knight Rises especially regarding how it tackles it's themes and story: this film isn't trying to raise the stakes, it's trying to add to the story, in this case his loneliness, his sense of powerlessness.

Hans Zimmer's score is some of the best I've ever heard, Wally Pfister peaked, had the best choreographed action scenes out of the whole trilogy, had the most emotionally resonant story out of the trilogy for sure. A very well made and satisfying conclusion that makes this trilogy one of the best .. ever?

A perfect comic book movie, certainly one of my favourites of all time"
"Christopher Nolan's *The Dark Knight Rises* serves as a powerful conclusion to his acclaimed Batman trilogy, delivering a breathtaking blend of action, emotion, and thematic depth that elevates the superhero genre. Set eight years after the events of *The Dark Knight*, Gotham City is in a state of uneasy peace, and Bruce Wayne, portrayed masterfully by Christian Bale, is a shadow of his former self. The film adeptly explores themes of redemption, resilience, and sacrifice, leaving viewers contemplating the complexities of heroism.

Nolan's direction is impeccable, capturing the grandeur and scale of Gotham in its darkest hour. The cinematography is striking, with sweeping shots that enhance the film's epic scope. The supporting cast, including Tom Hardy as the formidable Bane and Anne Hathaway as the enigmatic Selina Kyle, add depth and intrigue to the narrative. Hardy's portrayal of Bane is particularly noteworthy, bringing a physicality and menace that challenges Batman in unexpected ways.

The film's pacing is engaging, interspersing intense action sequences with moments of quiet reflection, allowing the audience to connect with the characters' struggles. The score, once again composed by Hans Zimmer, elevates the experience, underscoring the emotional stakes of the story.

Overall, *The Dark Knight Rises* is a triumphant conclusion that brings closure to Bruce Wayne's journey. It masterfully balances thrilling action with profound character development, solidifying its place as a modern cinematic classic. Fans of the genre and newcomers alike will find themselves captivated by this ambitious and emotionally charged finale."
"The tone of The Dark Knight Rises is set from the very first scene, when we are introduced to Bane (Tom Hardy) who crashes a plane that he himself is a passenger to. This is the first time we see the brute strength that he possesses. He is insanely strong through the use of the chemical ""venom"" which is pumped into him through his mask. As we leap into the rest of the story we see right away that director, Christopher Nolan, wasted no time in picking up right where he left off in The Dark Knight, with the death of Harvey Dent, and Batman being the criminal. This film was one of the big blockbusters in summer 2012, and for good reason. This movie brings the classic Batman comic book characters to life, which is evident in the acting, the sets, the script, the plot, and as many know, the dramatic ending. The acting is so well done, as we see emotion poured into each roll. Christian Bale (Bruce Wayne) Michael Cane (Alfred Pennyworth), Tom Hardy (Bane), and Anne Hathaway (Selena Kyle) all dove head first into their roles, leaving nothing behind. They each play a convincing role, identical to the characters that are portrayed in the Batman comics. One of the best examples is the relationship between Batman and Catwoman, because Batman is just, and Catwoman is a thief, but they are romantically involved with each other. The sets of this movie are stunning. Bruce Wayne's mansion and Batcave are just as they are depicted in the original comics. They are all encompassing and eye candy to any Batman lover. As we look back to the 1990's, we see a Batman comic book story arc that is very similar to the plot of TDKR. But Nolan's twist on the storyline is a refreshing change. Some may disagree, but not knowing what is coming next is part of the joy that comes with this film. Nolan keeps some of the key reference points in his film, but adds his own interesting, and modern additions to the film. Take for example, Bane's appearance. In the comics, Bane was unrealistically strong, and in the film he is much more realistically depicted. The only complaint I have with this film is, if Bane is so strong, why does he cover up his muscles with a vest or a coat for the majority of the movie? Show off your strength, be proud! The plot is the main focus point, like it should be. If explosions and fighting is all you want to see, then go see Pacific Rim. I'll say sorry in advance if you have wasted your time with that movie. Getting back on track to the plot, which might take a couple of watch throughs to fully catch all of the detail in this storyline. Throughout this movie, the focus is not on Batman, as one would expect, but on Gotham City itself. Bane brings the city to hell and back, and Batman is sitting on the side lines, bruised and battered, left watching, waiting, and hoping that his beloved city isn't left shattered and destroyed. The script of TDKR was written with pure precision, which allows us, as an audience, to remember key points of the movie through the use of dramatic quotes. Bane has a lot of one-liners that leave you repeating them to your friends after you see the film. Here are a few examples of memorable Bane quotes; ""But you merely adopted the dark; I was born in it, molded by it."" ""when it is done and Gotham is ashes, then you have my permission to die."" Because of Bane's voice, these short, memorable lines only add to the effect Nolan was going for. Leaving you on the edge of your seat wondering how Batman could possibly win? The moment you doubt if the good guy can win, that's when you know the director has succeeded.

This was a very well done film, and I encourage you to see it several times (it might take a few times to fully grasp the story) and the way this film ends is the perfect way to close out the series. In the end it all comes down to autopilot, back stabbing, and a turn of events by a woman you would not expect, all ending in an unpredictable manner."
The Dark Knight Rises is one of the most intense super hero movies I have watched. The opening scene is intense as the bad guys swing into action to get the good guys as the plane is moving into a tail spin. This time the world is void of the Bat crusader as he is in mourning the loss of his beloved. The plot lines are mix as you feel at times you need a chart to know who the good and bad guy is. The thread though out the movie is dark and deep and the most dramatic character is the bad guy Bane appears to take over the city of Gotham. A long movie that will keep you in total suspense until the end of the run. This movies does a good job of bringing into the mix several story lines from the comic book series. bravo!
"as much as i am huge fan of the batman in almost every facet of the genre, i am having a hard time getting completely behind this film. it makes the same mistake a lot of sequels do: it tries to pack too much into the story. the reason why the first two films in the trilogy, batman begins and the dark knight, worked so well was because they mostly focused on one central story and villain. in the dark knight rises there are too many new characters and too many story lines to be introduced and told that the film loses focus. sure it has plenty of action which you would expect but nolan strays too far from the source material when it comes to the characters in the film. the cast does a fine job with the script they had to work with and most film goers will probably like this film but i think true fans of the batman who know the history of the characters will wonder what nolan is doing to their batman."
"What is up with all this haters? Seriously, it makes me want to laugh because they're so ignorant. Some people here are saying: ""Worst Batman film ever"", or: ""I prefer watching Adam West Batman than this mess."" Wow, just wow. Anyways, enough complaining, this is one of the greatest conclusions in film trilogies history. No worry, this is a spoiler free review. The film is almost 3 hours long and the impressive thing is, the movie is NEVER dull, it's always keeping you interested because if its smart dialog and action. The story is great too. Bruce Wayne has stopped fighting crime as the Batman for 8 years after the Joker wanted to terrorize Gotham. But now a new threat has arrived, Bane. His plan is to burn Gotham to ashes and the Batman is the only one who can stop him.

Now the cast in this movie is really good. Christian Bale is a great Batman as always. Michael Caine deserves an Oscar nomination as best Supporting character for his amazing performance as Alfred Pennyworth. Anne Hathaway really impressed me as Catwoman. She steals any scene she's in. Tom Hardy as Bane is a great villain in this film. My favorite villain since the Joker. Joseph Gordon Levitt as John Blake delivers a good performance as well. Also Morgan Freeman and Marion Cottillard were good as well.

I love Trilogies, this trilogy is in my top 5 and ranks #2 right behind The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. In conclusion this is an amazing trilogy, the best of superheroes films and the second best trilogy of all time. All I have to say is, thank you Mr. Nolan, thank you. 10/10."
"This film is spectacular, the closest thing I have seen to perfection in film since the good ol days of filmmaking.

If you're hoping its better than The Dark Knight, your hopes have been answered. Christopher Nolan somehow outdoes himself once again, delivering a fantastic plot with great action, character development, and direction.

The writing itself is a wonder. The dialogue in this film is outstanding and perfectly fits each character.

Heath Ledger set a new standard for acting talent in comic book films. TDKR definitely meets that bar, possibly surpassing it. No single performance is better than Ledger's but everyone gives 110% in this and it comes together nicely. Christian Bale gives perhaps his most heartfelt performance in this one, and Tom Hardy is terrifying as Bane. Other regulars such as Caine and Oldman are just as good as ever. Joseph Gordon Levitt is a breath of fresh air and plays his part to perfection. However, I give it to Anne Hathaway for stealing the show. She is seductive, sexy, and dangerous as Catwoman, and becomes the very essence of the femme fatale.

Hans Zimmer continues to be my favorite film composer. His score simply blows me away, especially the way he uses the chants from the trailers as Bane's theme. Zimmer promised us an epic score, and delivered.

Editor Lee Smith and Director of Photography Wally Pfister both continue their win streak, as well as production designer Nathan Crowley and Costume designer Lindy Hemming.

All in all, TDKR is the best of this series. It is emotionally gripping and, at times, gutwrenching. As a current film student, I can honestly say that TDKR possesses all of the essential qualities of an Oscar for Best Picture. If you have seen the previous two Batman movies, you will enjoy this film so much more than you ever have. It truly is a whole new cinematic experience."
"So after seeing the The Dark Knight my expectations were pretty high for this movie and most movies would fail miserably but luckily The Dark Knight Rises is not one of most movies. It absolutely lived up to my expectations. What was good about the movie? Pretty much everything. The acting was top notch in this movie everyone does a good job in it. The action was great but the movie is great without action. Tom Hardy as Bane is one of the most terrifying villains I have ever seen. I likes the characters, the story everything. The one gripe that people might have is that it is very dark. But even that is not a real issue. In the end I loved this movie I recommend it to everyone an even though its not as good as The Dark Knight its still an amazing movie."
"Right from the start of the movie you will be on the edge of your seat. Personally I think this is the best conclusion I have ever seen. Performance of each actor in the movie is outstanding.Before I saw the movie I thought that Anne Hathaway wouldn't be as good cat-woman as Michelle Pfeiffer was, but not only was she better, she blew Michelle away. All the special effects are amazing and unbelievable. I have to say I love some of the batman's new toys. I have seen it in V Max theater last night but I am going to see it again in I MAX because Its worth the experience. It runs for 2 hours and 45 minutes but it felt like 30 minutes and I wanted more. 10 stars is not enough for such a great movie. I recommend to all movie lovers out there to go and see it in cinemas."
"what can i say really, this movie is fantastic. the plot is genius. the actors and so well put together. the best movie of 2012!

The direction they took this movie is beautiful. and the way ended the trilogy is breathtaking.

This is the best batman movie. his biggest job yet!

Save gotham one last time! the rise sequence is perfect. Lovie it!

10/10 all the way.

nolan the way.....

Nolan is amazing! :)

Also, Bane is great. Now i like joker and bane both. i like them eqaul. The joker scared me but yet i rooted for him. Bane really freaked me out! Scary stuff!"
"The Dark Knight Rises and Falls. I cannot put it in more simpler words than that.

I went in there with my coffers full of hope of having my mind blown out. After all it was Christopher Nolan and I am yet to see a work of his which has under-delivered.

But I guess everything has a first time.

Don't get me wrong. It's a good movie, not just a great one, and it left me highly confused as to how I should feel about it. TDKR, more than anything, falls under its own weight. With the endless hype and as a follow up to one of the greatest superhero movies of all time, TDKR had a lot riding on its shoulders. Tasked with this,Christopher Nolan has to be lauded for what he has achieved, or should I rather say 'hoped to'?

Let's begin with the basics. The Dark Knight trilogy was not a trilogy to begin with. Batman Begins (BB) and The Dark Knight (TDK) are almost two independent Batman films with little in common in terms of a story arc other than the characters it carries forward. That given, TDKR's greatest flaw was in attempting to connect the first movie to his final one so as to make it feel like one continuous arc. (Think kind of what happened in the final season of LOST) While I understand Nolan's intentions, the forced continuity just killed it.

This was further amplified by the many plot holes that marred the story. To keep this review spoiler free I will not mention any of them here but it will suffice to say that if you are a fan of the series but are willing to look past your fanboy goggles, the failings are plain to see.

Tom Hardy's take on the superstrong Bane was interesting enough to start off with, but as it went on there were just too many similarities with a previous villain (I will not say which one) to actually stand out on his own. Even his motives and methods were too familiar to be regarded as novel. His fights with Batman were epic enough though, and you almost pity Batman for having to face the mini-hulk that Hardy had transformed himself into. His menacing voice coupled with the cold hard stare in his eyes gave him the aura of a truly awful foe, one that must not be triffled with.

But add to that some cringe worthy dialogues, forgetful action sequences and appalling acting by Marion Cotillard, and I find myself subtracting more from the movie than adding. Nolan needed to make this movie bigger and better than the previous two, and for that he needed a crisis large enough to destroy Batman's world. While he did manage to conjur up a scheme, its immensity and implausibility made it hard to believe. I really wanted to love this movie but far too often found myself shaking my head in dismay as things got grander and larger, until they no more fit into the world.

But while I might seem to be cursing the movie a lot, remember I did say it is a good movie. And the best thing for me in the movie was - wait for it - Anne Hathaway as Catwoman/Selina Kyle.

I will confess that when I had first heard the casting I was more than dismayed. But now I'm forced to eat my own words. Anne Hathaway was brilliant. She might not be your regular comic book version of Selina Kyle, but in Nolan's Dark Knight universe she was the perfect choice to portray Gotham's sexiest vigilante. Everything from her stance to her fight moves and to the way she spouted sassy dialogues was perfect. Given more time and space, I am sure she could have probably stolen the show.

That however would have been unfair to Christian Bale/Bruce Wayne/Batman. The man has been a constant shining light throughout the series. He is a perfect fit for the role and has carried both versions of his character almost flawlessly. Moving into his third (and final) film in the series, I am glad to say he has not faltered a bit. While BB was about Batman, and TDK about the Joker, this movie was about Bruce Wayne the man behind the mask. As a superhero who is a mere mortal compared to most others out there, TDKR's focus on Bruce Wayne's mortality was totally warranted. This was not a Batman movie. This was a Bruce Wayne movie, with his alter ego guest starring. TDKR plays out like the swansong it is to this great character Bale and Nolan have moulded over the years.

Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine are as dependable as usual. They provided stellar performances as always. Even the newcomer to series - Joseph Gordon-Levitt gave a fine performance as the hotheaded cop John Blake. His character was by far one of the most interesting in the movie, developing into interesting dimensions, but alas finally being let down partly by the story and mostly by the limited run time that a movie of this scope can afford to a new character.

All in all, TDKR is a fine movie, but sadly nothing more. While I thoroughly enjoyed the ending (the last 5-10 minutes) and a bunch of scenes here and there, the action sequenced seemed bland, and the motives for some of the main characters left a lot to be desired. Batman was great as usual, but Bruce Wayne was better. And given the track-record of threequels, TDKR is a comparatively great ending to a great series, even if it is not all that it could have been. Probably the weakest entry to the series but nonetheless a wholesome entertainer on its own merits. Just don't expect to be blown away."
"I am not a critic but an average movie goer , but I must say that this movie is a pale shadow of the previous movie .

Missing the usual quality of a Chris Nolan movie . The movie lacks the frenetic pace of the previous title .First half of the movie is painfully slow . Second half picks up pace but still no big fireworks. Anne Hathaway unexpectedly performed very well in her role .

Weak story line .Background score average .Villain is simply lame with a dog mask ,and is nowhere near the calibre of Joker.No great twists or surprise in the plot ,lacks suspense .

Overall a better than average movie .Take my advice watch it at home ."
"The Dark Knight Rises is a brilliant,excellent and masterful epic conclusion to The Dark Knight Trilogy. Filled with excellent direction,wonderful performances,great Action and epic storytelling,The Dark Knight Rises is Christopher Nolan at his best.

Set eight years after the events in The Dark Knight,Batman/Bruce Wayne(Christian Bale) has been a recluse and retired as Batman and Gotham City has been at peace as well as safe and quiet. But when a new threat and terrorist named Bane(Tom Hardy)comes into Gotham City and threatens to destroy and demolish Gotham,Batman must come out of retirement to fight and face Bane and save the city of Gotham from destruction.

The Dark Knight Rises is a powerful and unforgettable conclusion to The Dark Knight Trilogy,it is a film that loved since I saw it in theaters and I cannot understand why the film has gotten a mixed to negative reception with most Batman fans. I guess because this film came out after Nolan's other films The Dark Knight and Inception which raised the bar really high when it comes to filmmaking and were universally loved by everyone and comparing this film with the other two this film can be seen as letdown for most people but not to me. The Dark Knight Rises is an Epic in the truest since of the word because Nolan has created a film that is big not only in length(2 Hours and 45 minutes)but in scope as well bringing everything to higher level whether it's the Action or the storyline. The film was so epic it probably would be longer with an overture like the epics of the 50s and 60s. Most of the time the third film in the trilogy is usually seen as the weakest but Nolan is a smart filmmaker who knows that if you are going to complete a trilogy you have to go out with a huge bang and TDKR goes out with not only a bang but with explosions. What I love about TDK Trilogy is that while all of them are three connected films all them are different in story. If Batman Begins is an origin story and Action/Adventure and The Dark Knight is a Crime Drama then TDKR can be described as a War Film. TDKR is War Film in sense where there are armies rising and gangs are controlling the streets with power,guns and tanks and Gotham is divided like a Civil War between the rich and poor or cops and criminals. With the theme of War and control running throughout the film you pulled into a Dystopian nightmare where Gotham City is being held hostage and not the cops or government can do anything about it and the only person that can do anything about is Batman. In TDKR we see not only the physical but also the mental toll being Batman has had on Bruce Wayne. Bruce has become broken down and a recluse and the damage of being Batman has affected his friendships and relationships or lack there of. Bane is such a great villain because where The Joker in TDK wanted to make people evil and corrupt and wanted to burn Gotham,Bane wants the people of Gotham to take control and take back the city of Gotham from the corrupt and the rich and create a revolution and army and still wants to destroy Gotham City. Bane is villain unlike Batman has ever faced before because Bane can match Batman on no only a physical level but on an intelligence level as well. The Action scenes in the film are amazing and like the first two films are done in a realistic way. Each Action scene is handled with a great deal of suspense and build up and this time it is done on an big scale to match the epic feel of the film. When the Action in the film happens you are glued to the screen and mesmerized. The ending of the film lasts about 20-30 minutes and it will blow you away with it's filmmaking and craft. The ending will have you cheering and smiling and it is a great conclusion to this film and The Dark Knight Trilogy.

The cast does an excellent jobs in their roles. Christian Bale is excellent in his final performance as Batman/Bruce Wayne bringing the same depth and intensity to the role. Tom Hardy is simply brilliant and scary as Bane,with using his voice,eyes and body language for the performance. Hardy's performance in my opinion makes Bane one of the best villains in film history. Gary Oldman is great once again as Jim Gordan,with Oldman bringing cynicism and depth to the role. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is fantastic as Blake,an idealistic rookie cop. Anne Hathaway is wonderful and sexy as Catwoman/Selina Kyle and has great scenes with Bale. Marion Cotillard does a great job as Miranda,Bruce's other love interest. Morgan Freeman excels once again as Lucius Fox,Batman's weapon maker. Michael Caine is amazing once again as Alfred. Caine's final scenes with Bale are powerful and well-acted. Matthew Modine(Foley)and Ben Mendelsohn(Daggett)give good performances as well.

The direction by Christopher Nolan is excellent and brilliant,with Nolan always moving the camera and having great shots and camera angles and giving the film an epic feel and Nolan does a great job with the Action scenes. Great direction by Nolan.

The score by Hans Zimmer is brilliant and intense and matches the dark and epic tone of the film. A great memorable score by Zimmer.

In final word,if you love Batman,Christopher Nolan,Comic Book films,Superhero films or films in general,I highly suggest you see The Dark Knight Rises,a brilliant,masterful and epic conclusion to an excellent trilogy that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10."
"well may lot of you not going to like my review cause am really really a great big fan of batman.after batman begins,and fabulous the dark knight,am just waiting when the 3rd installment of nolan series going to released.well a lot of time has passed but i am writing this review because i just thought i should have right something for it cause i love this movie.its almost 2 years now and trust me friends,,every night i watch one of the batman movie.specially dark knight rises,i have watched it more than 200 times.so i think you can imagine i am quite disbalanced from my head site.whatever people say it don't really matter.the only thing is matter how much did u enjoyed when you seen a movie.christopher nolans batman series is one of the best movies i have seen in my life.many many thanks to you sir.Christian bale,,you are just amazing.the joker, ben each and every character are truly remarkable.i just love the full batman team.the dark knight is the best in the series.but the dark knight rises may don't have the strong content like the previous installment but its really a huge entertainment for me.hope batman will come again to save the gotham..."
"Title: The title is perfect for movie story specially for main character. Actually it's better than 'batman' to me.

Genre: Action: In my point of view, action seemed to be a wrestling show.

Crime: Yes, this is an actual crime movie.

Thrill: It's truly thrilling at each and every sequence of movie.

Drama: The total dramatic plot is tremendously evolved with strong characters

Visual Effects: The batman's ride thing, bike, burning property etc are extremely accurate.

Character: Obviously Christian Bale and Tom Hardy.

Overall, I like it. It is really enjoyable and entertaining. Of course you'd want to see it again and again."
"I don't know where to start,. The power source shown in movie caught my eye;its very nice of Nolan to show the very future power source without loss of reality.

The action scenes between Wayne and Bane are so dramatic that when Batman hits Bane it clearly portrays that it was more out of confidence and will to fight against evil rather than strength and muscle whereas it appears opposite in case of Bane hitting Batman.The Catwoman's action scenes couldn't have been better the attitude,spontaneous performance,flexibility in physique are perfectly played by Anne Hathaway.

Hans Zimmer's music is an extra ordinary asset to the film .the back scroll in every action sequence is so wonderful to bring up goose bumps all-over.Especially the chant 'deh-shay bas-ha bas-ha' is clouded with drum beat and would take you into the depths of morality in the movie.

After a movie like 'The Dark Knight' its the very guts of Nolan to continue that should be appreciated.he must be a very good social visionary to write-up such an excellent ending to the trilogy.I don't need to separately chant praises on his direction and screenplay.And the twists in movie surprises everyone."
"With a gargantuan ambition, huge stakes, powerful themes, compelling characters and a fantastic third act, The Dark Knight Rises exceeded my already sky high expectations, and delivered an extremely satisfying conclusion to the trilogy."
"Words cannot adequately describe how awesome this movie is! It is everything you thought it would be and much more. Most certainly a beautifully crafted psychological crime thriller and a truly satisfying conclusion that does justice to the trilogy. Batman isn't exactly the cool hero with fancy gadgets nor is he the strongest. His inner strength is tested, he is physically and mentally pushed to his limits and all odds are against him. What an epic finale!

Christian Bale as always is perfect as Bruce Wayne and Batman but Tom Hardy's portrayal of Bane almost steals the show. Unlike Batman's mask where you get to see the emotions through eyes and mouth of the actor, Bane's mask covers his entire mouth, leaving only his eyes in view. Despite an obscured face, actor Tom Hardy seems to have found a way to brilliantly express his emotions physically! He projects Bane's character, the strength, pain, attitude and the darkness by movements and body language alone! Bane is as intellectual as he is strong, which makes him genuinely terrifying. He is easily the most formidable of all Batman villains in the trilogy and simply owned the scenes he was in.

Hans Zimmer does an excellent job with the background score that sets the pace of the movie and compliments the visual artistry. The music makes you feel the excitement and energy of the movie. Both Anne Hathaway and Joseph Gordon-Levitt do justice to their characters. Hathaway is believable as Catwoman. Last but not the least, Michael Caine gives a very effective and heartfelt performance as Alfred.

The special effects in this movie are so good, that it seems very real. The Batpod, which made its appearance in Dark Knight is back in this movie and it is exceedingly cool. But wait till you see 'The Bat'!

This movie has a stellar start, will keep you on the edge of your seat with adrenaline-pumping action sequences, intense drama both emotional and dark, has several layers of the story interweaving with frequent curve balls thrown in. But the movie never loses momentum, it ultimately sets you up for a fantastic climax and probably a very unpredictable yet satisfying end. It will keep you guessing till the very last second and that is the magic of Christopher Nolan's amazing masterpiece, The Dark Knight Rises.

I will give this movie 10 out of 10."
"Every time a good superhero movie is made ,fanatic fanboys have to rush to IMDb to declare it as the ""Greatest Movie Ever Made"" LOL,, I do give them credit for a least being consistent. With that said, it was a good movie but should not even be in any top 100. Yes, the storyline was far fetched for real life but hey, it's the norm for a sci-fi thriller action movie. Villain wants to destroy stuff,, hero must stop him. It was well acted, and the action, while not ground breaking was shot very well. While Anne Hathaway is great to look at, and done an okay job , I felt you could of totally removed her character from the entire film and it would not have made any difference . It was almost like her role was just filler material. In the end to me it's just a fun summer movie to get lost in,,but not to put on a pedestal..."
"The Dark Knight rises is easily the most anticipated film of the year and has a lot to live up to with the previous two entries just seeming to get better and better. With the same creative team intact, can Nolan and Bale pull off the ultimate finale to their trilogy and deliver the film we've all been waiting for or will it fall to the dreaded bad third film syndrome that seems to plague most series?

The Dark Knight Rises continues the journey of Batman eight years after he took the fall for the death and crimes of Harvey Dent. Forced back into action to take on the terrorist Bane, the Dark Knight returns to protect the city that looks at him as an enemy. The Dark Knight was a brilliant film on numerous levels so going in this film already had a big hurdle to overcome. While it may not have completely overshadowed the previous entry, it easily finds its place on equal ground. This final entry to the Nolan series continues to bring these three films together becoming essentially one long film. Rises brings new realm of personal journey to numerous characters old and new. Christian Bale steps back into the role like he never left bringing a new pain that seems to elevate both Wayne and Batman to another level. Most fans will be happy to know that while the growl like voice is still here, it is toned down a bit so not to be quite as off putting. Michael Caine is given a bit more to do taking the character study between Alfred and Wayne that has been building and he delivers more of his motivational and emotional speeches like only he can. Gary Oldman gets a bit more to do as well getting to channel the Gordon we have been waiting for since the beginning. Tom Hardy steps into the role of Bane, a character that is met with mixed emotions. Known in the comics as the villain that broke the bat, has had many incarnations, most of them not all that good and not widely known to those that aren't comic fans. Believe it or not, Nolan has taken a fairly single dimension character and brought to life a destructive force that smashes through this film with no remorse. The big surprise was Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle aka Catwoman. She seemed to be channeling some of the previous versions, most notably that of the 60's series minus the camp. She really makes this character work bringing the sexiness as well as a more empowered woman aspect to the character. She is easily the best incarnation of this character so far.

The story is well crafted bringing all the characters together along with the story to create an epic piece of filmmaking. There are numerous levels to the story that worked well for every character giving each of them their own small story without ever making the film feel overcrowded or forced. It takes a bit to get going, but not in a bad way. There are some pretty heavy moments that push this film along, but will keep you away from the action for longer than you may want. Much like the source material this trilogy is a character study of the inner struggles of a man and not so much about the action. Make no mistake there are plenty of action sequences, each bigger than the next. Nolan has slowed the action down a bit, namely during the fight scenes letting the viewer finally get a better glimpse of the Dark Knight in action. Kudos to Nolan as gone are most of the fancy well-choreographed fights and in their place is a brutality that is needed to make the Bane story work.

This is not only a great film, but a brilliant cap to an already brilliant series. It's a truly amazing experience to see this film come to life and wrap up a series that has continued to get better and better. There are plenty of moments that will make both comic and non-comic fans alike smile and cheer. Nolan has stamped his mark on the Batman universe and has done something almost never thought possible. He has delivered a brilliant Batman trilogy and managed to keep the entire brilliant cast in tact all the way down to members of the Wayne Corp board members. This is a film that will make you cheer and sad that it is coming to an end. As this series comes to an end and the credits role you will find yourself sighing in relief and happiness knowing Nolan pulled it off and wondering what's next for the Batman."
"Ultimately, this is an excellent film, but after seeing this as part of an all night trilogy viewing, I have to say it is not as good as The Dark Knight.

The film opens with, strangely for Nolan a quite farcical scene that introduces Bane. I won't spoil it, but please tell me, who takes 3 unknown prisoners on a plane without even looking at their faces? Really??

The proper story starts, and to chose words like jaded, withdrawn, cynical, tired, lethargic and disconnected, is how we find our hero and Police commissioner. So ultimately this is how the audience is manipulated into feeling too, and so act 1 is ultimately a long ""downer"" as lots of elements are put in place for the last 2 acts. But, after sitting through six hours of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, I was left feeling it was too much, and I started getting bored with the overall emotional shade of the film, coupled with the lack of action and the lack of any real story. It was like watching a plate spinner getting 40 plates spinning on pointy poles, necessary for his act, but ultimately boring for his audience.

The second Act is where our bad guy makes his play and gains the upper hand. One of the strongest sources of praise for The Dark Knight, is the ultimately real-world story telling. But what Bane unleashes on Gotham, takes us back to the more comic book villainy of the first film, which I won't criticise, but for me is not as rewarding as the realism of the second film. All the while our good guys are slow, wrong footed, and creaking under their mental baggage, so we are two thirds through a superhero film, where our superhero has been anything but. Action has been thin on the ground, and we have all been through the ringer, and we are crying for some redeeming pay-off.

After the third act, our her is restored, all has been put right. However, ultimately our pay-off for all we have been put through in the first two acts is only satisfying if you can shrug off the memory of what you have just been put through. It's much like childbirth, you need your brain to be swimming with endorphins to blank out the pain of labour, and for me, I didn't get enough endorphins to make the experience totally rewarding.

Add to this, a slightly facial bad-guy twist, and a groan-worthy sequel shoe-in, I have to say that Nolan has tried to squeeze in far too much, and Batman's saga creeps over the line, rather than ending with a bang, so much so, you will feel convinced that this is not the final part of the story, and we will need another installment to accept that our hero has sailed off into the sunset."
"Apologies, Dominus, I have done many reviews here but to get this one right took me 5 years and multiple re-watchings.

Conclusion? Not merely great, but the ""great-est"" superhero film of all time. The story is iconic and majestic in scope. The script not merely good, it borders on perfection. The performances are nothing less than stunning.

Bale and Oldman could not give a bad performance even if you asked them. Hathaway has never looked this good, her height and frame infusing her Catwoman with a vibe never seen before or since. And the almost-invisible Tom Hardy (one of the greatest actors of our age, BTW) makes Bane as interesting a character, if not moreso, than even Darth Vader himself.

So why did this review take me 5 years? To discover the dissonance between the three parts of the trilogy, which is the only flaw, the Achilles Heel of the boxed set.

Ordinarily a trilogy should be harmonious and consistent. Look at the original Lord of the Rings as the best example. Each part not only stands on its own but, taken in sequence, the story builds, the characters become clearer, everything works to a conclusion.

Like an orchestra reaching a crescendo.

Not so here. The whole is weakened by the sum of the parts. Batman Begins is, frankly, sloppy. Great ideas and even great performances are lost in a weak narrative with a unsatisfying conclusion.

The Dark Knight has become iconic in its own right but not because of the way it continues the story, but rather because of the amazing one-of-a-kind performance by Ledger.

It is only when we get to Part 3 that we achieve perfection. This film is not merely better than than the first two, it may be the best film of its genre, ever."
"It's been eight years since the events of the immediate predecessor to this(a film that this matches in most ways, tops in several, and the only thing it lacks that that has, is Heath Ledger's Joker, and, well, that's part force majeure), and we see the outcome of that. Legislation has made organized crime a thing of the past in the city, and with no need for the caped crusader, Bruce(once again impeccably acted by Bale... and yes, the voice has thankfully been toned down) has a gap in his life that he doesn't know how to fill(straining the relationship between him and Alfred, played by the usually charming and compelling Caine). When a mysterious masked man, known as Bane, a dominating physical presence with a brain(played largely by Hardy's eyes and brows... taking a ton of his tools as an actor away, and still he does incredible), with unclear motives makes his presence known, he realizes he will have to become Batman again. But is he enough to take out this new threat? This finishes the series, providing closure to the characters and story. Catwoman is done right here, and just about perfect. She's finally a femme fatale... hot and manipulative. They do with her what we hoped they'd do with Black Widow. And this does justice to the relationship between her and Wayne. The performances are great all around. Most return from the other two(and Freeman gets a lot more to do), with a few new faces, such as Gordon-Levitt as idealistic cop John. This does a lot to surprise us, and like TDk, it does it right, with hardly any of them being unnecessary, and none of them insulting. The bleakness is back and amplified - this puts its titular hero and its audience through a serious amount of pain and conflict, with a genuine feeling that it might not work out. And as a result of this, and other brave decisions made(you can barely believe these are mainstream movies!), it becomes really powerful, really draws us in. The action is the biggest and best of these(the jet he uses is awesome! And the Pod gets some more really cool use, in the edge-of-your-seat chases, and we get fast martial arts(and covered well!), and the stakes and tension are the highest(and frankly, if they were raised any higher, it would be excessive... this is already as draining as the last one). There is a lot of disturbing content, some violence and a little moderate to strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone interested in these(and make sure you've watched the other two first, this really adds to them). 10/10"
"Got to watch it in a preview show here in India. Was stunned with the way Nolan has narrated the story. It is simply AWESOME! Everything looks so perfect here, right from the starting, till the end credits roll. Even though i am not an ardent fan of action/superhero movies, I liked the first two installments of the series, so the expectation for this was so huge. And to be frank, i am happy with the outcome. Ii is brilliant in every aspect. Nolan's direction is top-notch and he is the real hero of the movie. I even felt goosebumps in certain sequences. I do not want to reveal the story much, but what i can say is, this one is a must for every movie lover. Such an awesome performance from Tom Hardy! I was just amazed to see him perform Bane. Christian Bale is no less, he is literally perfect reprising his role from the previous two films. The other actors have done good job. But i missed Heath Ledger, may his soul rest in peace. Anyway, what i have to say is, do not miss this film, lest it is a real loss for you. I would like to rate it 8.5/10, And Hats off to Nolan and the entire crew for giving us such a cinematic experience."
"Another achievement by Nolan Bros. and Warner Bros... Thanks to its huge budget available (ca 230 million USD) one could use state-of-the-art technology and employ a dream-team of actors of different generations: Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Anne Hathaway, Joseph Gordon-Levitt... And they got the opportunity to have elaborated roles to play, not just appearing in the background; Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth is probably the finest of the great ones. Moreover, it is no comic strip movie, but an epic story of universal values, attitudes and issues, with superhero and sci-fi moments complementing the script, not governing it.

Minuses from me due to length (ca 2,5 hours) and too obvious references/comparisons with characters from other hit movies (e.g. Hannibal, Catwoman, James Bond). But still, the movie is worth watching and recommendable!"
"This movie is full of excitement, explosions, and edge of your seat moments. It ties up all of the loose ends in a great culmination to the series. The casting is perfect. I was surprised by some of the characters that were added. I would have liked to see the story line continued though. It is a bit of a let down that they didn't incorporate more of the villains.Or even continue the series to include cooperative adventures for multiple DC heroes.It is great that they managed to keep all of the same actors from the previous movies. It irritated me when they changed the actress who played Rachel. I think that this is a good date movie or movie for a family with older children. Of course it is great for a guys night. Make sure you have you popcorn ready."
"As the ending chapter in the trilogy I enjoyed this movie the most. It had more of Bruce Wayne than just Batman. It showed Bruce's face behind the Batman mask and did so believably. Like we all know the Joker took the spotlight in the previous film and the first one was more Batman action. So we got a trilogy with a balanced focus between the guise, the seamlessly corrupt and the person behind the guise. Which is nice.

As a movie about the struggling person behind the mask this was, for me, the most touching out of the three films. And the most hope inducing, seeing Bruce Wayne recollect himself from the pit and rise to stand on his own feet. Re-mustering his courage and will."
"The Dark Knight Rises (2012)

*** 1/2 (out of 4)

The final film in Christopher Nolan's trilogy finds Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) coming out of retirement and putting on the Batman suit as he tries to save Gotham City from a nuclear weapon being controlled by Bane (Tom Hardy). THE DARK KNIGHT RISES isn't quite as good as the previous film but I'd put it a little ahead of the first movie in the series but no matter how you rank them you really have to give Nolan, Bale and company credit for really delivering a very special series that I'm sure went a lot higher than most people thought when news broke that this group would be taking over the franchise. While this film is far from perfect there are still so many great things that it's easy to get lost in the film and caught up in the various situations going on. I think the strongest thing going for the picture is the wonderful visual style and as with the previous two films, the way Nolan builds this dark atmosphere and city is just something so many other directors should be studying going forward. Another major asset is that Bale can bring that dark and mysterious nature to the Wayne character while at the same time being very believable in the part of Batman. I think it's fair to say that he's put his stamp on the character and if this is his last go at it then he's done more than any previous actor. The supporting cast includes strong work from Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Mario Cotillard and Gary Oldman. Hardy was extremely good in the villain role of Bane and really helped make the film so much fun. Anne Hathaway gives a decent performance as Catwoman but I must admit that I thought the screenplay really didn't do much for the character and in the end she had little impact with me. The 164-minute running time does seem a bit too drawn out at spots but I was still rather amazed at how well it flowed and this credit certainly goes to Nolan. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES closes this trilogy and really ends it with a bang and it's clear that the series going forward will have a lot to live up to."
The writing is horrible and the pace is agonizingly draining.
"To be honest....there's not much to say about this movie. I am an avid film critic and I am completely lost for words.

Christopher Nolan is the best director/writer/producer/creator right now and now arguably of all time. Christian Bale = consistently phenomenal. Tom Hardy = unbelievable. Hewitt = great young actor. Hathaway = incredible. Freeman = Freeman, enough said.

The Dark Knight Rises has not only set the bar for superhero/action movies, but movies of all genres. 15/10..yup. Unbelievable.

There really isn't much to say about this movie because honestly there is nothing to compare it too. NO movie comes close...try to argue it and I will leave you in the dust. Enough said...I'm done. WOW"
"Before I get down-voted because I'm not giving 'The Dark Knight Rises' a 10 (the trend most of the users on her seem to be following), I'll list the numbers of things I really enjoyed about the film, and there were plenty.

-The cast Nolan's able to put together to end his trilogy is really something to marvel at. From the veterans of the series (Bale, Freeman, Caine, Oldman) to the new faces (Gordon-Levitt, Cotillard, Hathway, Hardy) each bring their all to their characters, even if a few are somewhat undeveloped (more on that later).

-Action scenes. 'Batman Begins,' while I admire it for it's first look at the gritty take to the comic formula, had some incredible poor and incomprehensible fight scenes, where it was unclear how who punching what or what was happening. In 'The Dark Knight,' the scenes were much more clear, a big improvement. Here, the fighting scenes are at their best. When Baine and Batman throw down, it's some of the most intense fight scenes I've seen in a long time.

-Huge setpieces. I could say that about all of these movies, but in this film especially. Gotham City is beautifully recognized. It's always great to see a huge place like this down naturally, never been plagued by artificial CGI (Nolan uses as little as possible.) Not to mention the number of extras, which number in the thousands.

-The ending. Even if it jumps the shark, the ending to Nolan's epic trilogy is overall fulfilling. Fans of the series won't be disappointed, even if the casual might

Not that that's out of the way, the problems I had with the film. . .

-Bane's voice. When we first meet Bane, on a plane, his voice was nearly unbearable. It sounded like something a ten-year-old would do when playing with audio effects on his computer. The dialogue didn't help, as he spewed out clunky one-liners. Here was Bane, with his terrifying appearance,sounding like a cartoon. It did improve over the ocurse of the movie, but the first introduction to the character was something I almost couldn't shake off.

-Too many character introductions. Maybe this is a criticism of the whole trilogy, but I'll have to put the blame on this one. Too many characters are brought in, with their developments feeling rushed. It almost appears like Nolan adds these new additions to the script at the last minute.

For the most part, the good outweighs the bad. It's a very entertaining film and, as far as summer blockbusters, it's definitely worth the price of admission.

7/10"
"I have seen all of the batman movies (all of them) and saying the The Dark Knight Rises is the best out of any of them is no understatement. Nolan delivers a spectacular conclusion to the best trilogy I've ever witnessed in the cinemas. Every camera shot, order of scenes, and the dialogue was so meticulously delivered, it sets the bar pretty damn close to perfection.

Lets start off with the actors, Christian Bale reprised the role of Batman brilliantly. Failure, redemption, and all the emotions that took part in his character, Bale delivered and did to convincingly. Anne Hathaway, although she had big shoes to fill (pheiffer) did not disappoint. I could see why a younger fresher actress beaten out the likes of Angeline Jolie and Charlize Theron for the role. The Selina Kyle in Nolan's interpretation was cunning, intelligent, beautiful, deadly and yet humane. The veterans (john michael cane, morgan freeman) were fantastic as expected. The real surprise for me was Tom Hardy. The manifestation of Bane. The first thing that came to my mind while I was walking out of the theater was how much fear the character had conveyed. Not only in his own actions but how people reacted to his character. I am sort of tired so I will stop here. I must say though, to all who love bashing movies, save it for another. This movie is one to see. Don't wait for it come out on bluray or download it, go to the theater and watch it. It is not a movie, but an experience."
"I was super excited since the very day when the trailer of the movie came out and was waiting ever eagerly for another master piece by one of the greatest movie makers of all time Christopher Nolan. I was fortunate enough to see it first day. And yes it was not all disappointing as the movie was truly amazing.

The story line woven intricately with all the characters touches you heart, mind and soul and you wish that the experience never ends and keeps you on the edge of the seat till the end of the movie.

Nolan has definitely added another master-piece to his ever-lasting collection and the grand finale will truly leave you spell-bound.

Christian bale as impressive as usual and Tom Hardy plays the Bane flawlessly.

Anna Hathaway does justice so as ever depending Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine. Joseph is also amazing.

Hans Zimmer music leaves is awesome which will be ringing in your ears even after you have left the cinema ! Oh boy, what we all have been waiting for is here and a must see for everyone !!!!!

One of the best trilogies ever made !

YES, THE DARK KNIGHT HAS RISEN !!!! Dey-shey dey-shey Bah-sur-rah bah- sur-rah !!!!!"
"Christopher Nolan does not make simple movie anymore, does he? I was emotionally exhausted right from the start to finish in this captivating 2 hours and 45 minutes of viewing, I barely have time to digest the richness of its storytelling and it lingered in my mind long after experienced it.

The Dark Knight Rises (TDKR) is a fitting epic ending to the most compelling, ambitious superhero movie trilogy ever. In term of audaciousness, the closest I can think of is another DC Comics, Watchmen (Snyder, 2009), without a doubt you are looking at the pinnacle of superhero comic movie adaptation in these two. Both have equal brooding style, Watchmen has a superior narrative style because it is benefited from a direct existing material while Nolan's Batman trilogy punches pure entertainment with accessibility to both general audience and comic geeks.

By the 3rd part of trilogy, gone are the days of the main characters' introduction, where we are straight to the engrossing pay off time.Batman's vehicle evolved from Tumbler who looks like tank to a two-wheels Batpod to The Bat that fly with ease (yes, Lucius Fox confirms that it comes in black colour). The story sets 8 years after the event of The Dark Knight where Bruce Wayne went into long hiatus. The newcomer Anne Hathaway plays the role of Catwoman. Under normal circumstances, she and Catwoman do not belongs to the same bracket, but somehow she pull it off with the seductive performance coupled with the touch of insecurity from her. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays as a closed aide to Commissioner Gordon. Meanwhile, Marion Cottillard is an important figure in Wayne Enterprise.

The main villain, Bane is played by Tom Hardy where his presence on the screen is downright menacing. He is physically tough and hulky. He may not be as intimidating as Joker, but somehow I fear for anyone who is near to him because he seems like he would snap the neck of the person standing next be it his henchmen or enemy. I really felt for Batman during one of the brutal knuckle fight with Bane. He absolutely gives Batman a painful thumping. On the grand scale, he masterminded a sinister plan for the downfall of Gotham City. He strikes the people of Gotham with fear, he actually gives the Gotham citizens some faint hope before striking it down with furious vengeance, all before the eyes of a helpless Bruce Wayne. Given the fleshed out background story, it is obvious Bane is the most complex villain in TDK trilogy.

I am pleased that we are now at the second decade of the golden age of superhero comic movie adaptation where there are plenty of choices we are spoilt of. The sky is the limit as far as CGI is concern, nowadays no matter how transcendent the comic is, the cinema medium just easily lift the concept from the comic book panels. While Joss Whedon's The Avengers is fun, loud, a kind of borderline juvenile stuff, TDKR on the other hand is a serious, realistic, brooding, Gothic feel drama. It stings to say this because I am a huge follower of Joss. Let me reiterate that The Dark Knight Rises is an epitome to action-orientated movie; not just limit to superhero comic adaptation genre. Whoever wants to remake a movie about Batman after Christopher Nolan, I wish him/her best of luck.

My movie review at www.sowyau.blogspot.com/"
"I would like to suggest that researching anything to deep about this film is a bad idea. Go into it with a clean slate. The experience will be ruined for you if you do not.

REVIEW IN SUMMARY:

The movie was phenomenal. It never slows, and I was surprised it was over when the time came. If you've disliked the pacing of past Nolan films, you will be fine with this one. This movie has incredible acting, a beautiful story, and is the perfect end to the Trilogy.

FULL REVIEW:

For starters, the Nolan brothers have created a masterpiece of a script. The themes explored in this film are stirring, and inspiring. The story is beautiful, and full of depth. Those of you looking for a simple mindless thriller will probably find this film to be, ""alright"", but you won't get the hype behind it. You won't understand everyone's obsession with this film. If you haven't liked Nolan's previous work, you won't like this one. It's not about the action, or the simple mindless battles many superhero movies today are all about. It's not as simple as those are. But do not despair, there is more large scale action in this then any of the other Batman films thus far.

But, it is easy to follow. Even if you haven't seen the other movies in the franchise you will understand it. The other movies add depth, so I suggest you see the other two films before you see this one, but all the same you'll be able to follow it.

Chris Nolan tells the story well. It wasn't as choppy and unorganized as some of his past films. This one is by far his best work.

Tom Hardy brings an elegance to the villain of Bane that is addicting. Yes, you read right, and elegance. Class. He is a classy villain, whose motivations are understandable, and frighteningly relatable. This is, in my opinion, his best work aside from Warrior.

As far as comparisons to the Joker go, it's like comparing an apple to an orange. Except when you bight into Bane, and the threat he presents, you'll forget the Joker even existed.

Anne Hathaway won't be disappointing. I know I, like many of you, was worried when we saw that name on the cast list. But she does fine.

This movie will stir your emotions. Satisfy your need for action. Satisfy your need for Batman. And satisfy your need for insurmountable villains. It will also satisfy those who have read the comics. Although this story does not follow in exactness to any original comic, Nolan cleverly manipulates the characters to fit the comic agenda, in a more ""modern"" or ""realistic"" sense.

This film is full of surprises. So I suggest you stop reading these reviews, avoid potential spoilers, and go enjoy the show."
"Title says it all. Epic storyline, perfect musical score, perfect acting, and one of the most emotional endings I have ever seen. This trilogy is the ""star wars"" of our generation. I'm not kidding. Oh, and for all of you IMDb users posting about the plot holes...really? People, it's called ""willing suspension of disbelief"" ever heard of it?

Go see the film and enjoy yourself. This is the one of the only action film I have seen outside of its prequel that doesn't sacrifice story for more explosions. Every character is fully realized and acts their part in such a convincing manner that they become more 3-dimensional than most characters do throughout an entire trilogy.

And Bane? Oh man, Bane is one of the best villains you will ever have the pleasure to see (and quite a well-scripted one too).

This is more than a comic-book film. This is a new classic. The Dark Knight has risen."
"Words cannot express how I felt after watching The Dark Knight Rises.. A sense of hope that even in the most dismal of situations one should have. A sense of relief that this trilogy did not go in the way of most trilogies. A sense of sadness that this would be the last batman movie in the Nolan franchise. But more than all this, I was elated and joyous about the way this movie kept my interest throughout the whole 2 hrs 45 min. To say one word about this film.. EPIC !!! . All the characters completely complimented one another. Was especially astounded by Bale, Hathaway, Hardy and Caine's performances. I am definitely going once again for this one."
"So let me start out with the negatives. This film was the least great of the three in my opinion. It had some major plot holes and confusion at the ending. But that's also something that made it great, because it is an ending that could be interpreted in different ways. So in one way, it could not be seen as a major plot hole although it has in my book. Anywho, the main antagonist Bane is one of my favorites. Find out in the film to see why, because it sure took me by a bit of surprise. On the other hand, some other appearances were quite obvious to be, but still enjoyable nonetheless. In general Christopher Nolan has made an epic trilogy that surely will stay a classic over the years to follow."
I love that this is all one big action sequence it really keeps you on your toes with a lord of the rings type war story for the climax a good movie for someone who looks for a thrill.
"First of all, when I was in the theater watching (The Dark Knight) I said to myself that there's no way I'm going to miss the next movie in this series. after the epic nature and the overwhelming performance also the art of directing that makes you live inside the movie as we have seen in The Dark Knight, I expected this one to be at least the same level and I was absolutely correct. Christopher Nolan is the best Director out there, the way he makes you become part of the movie and feel the same feeling of every character you see is just magical, and add to that the fantastic music of Hans Zimmer, not to mention the Perfect Selection of the Actors and Actresses in this movie. Before The Dark Knight all of us used to watch super hero movies and consider them the kind of thing that would never happen in real life but things changed after the epic clash between batman and the Joker, The Dark Knight Rises even make it more reasonable it makes you think that if there was a batman he would be exactly like this. and it is being proved in each scene as you go through the movie, how hard it is to live with the cruelty of bane, how it is really hard to find weapons and devices to use that they use everything they got (unlike other action movies that everyone suddenly have a 100 gun when it is time to fight) it is like what would really happen if Bane came to your city and Batman was to defend it. in other words you can call this movie a masterpiece,if you didn't watch it yet then what are you waiting for?"
"As everyone i went to this movie with lot of expectations,you know what? Nolan has done an unimaginable Batman movie which can be done only by him. He is a master in what he does.Coming to the movie,from the first frame the movie was absorbing and mind blowing. The Character of Bane was portrayed brilliantly. All the characters does their part 10/10.The twists in the story were awesome and was absolutely unpredictable.The Visual Effects were way too good. Lots of humor in the movie when compared to previous Nolan movies.The combination of classy dialogs and performance of the actors make it the best movie of Nolan so far.To end NOLAN DOES IT AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!:)"
"Immediately, probably, it should be stipulated that I'm not a fan of superhero films, I'm not a fan of comics, and even from cartoons, I'd rather have chosen ""Tom and Jerry"" than a cartoon about Batman. But despite all the first two films of the trilogy described above, I liked them very much. The reason for this is probably the cool, noir atmosphere of Gotem created by the directors, the fine acting and, of course, the good script stories. Well, after such a long introduction, it is logical to ask the question, what about the third part? Nothing! Absolutely nothing! In the final part of the trilogy there is absolutely nothing that I liked in the first two previous parts of the trilogy. The weakest part of the film is probably the script, and this fact is very surprising, as Christopher in all his works spent a lot of time developing the script (which is only the scenario of ""Memento""). Think about the reasons why the script in this picture is so weak you can endlessly. It is worth saying that most of the film is trying to build an exhibition, to reveal the main actors, but the author does not get it in the end, half the time is incredibly boring watching. So the script is so drawn and adjusted for the denouement that it's simply impossible not to notice it, it simply contradicts all laws of logic and healthy meaning. The performances of some scenes are very depressing, many battle scenes also give up cretinism, and it is not clear how they can be looked at. Yes, in the end, Christopher prepared his own story twist, but even he did not work and was predictable and boring. And as for the final scenes, I'm sorry, I could not stand it, how much forgiveness do I have to spit on all the laws of physics, science and just common sense, what would come up with this ?! Well, in general, with the plot all. The second question that arose after watching where the atmosphere of Gotham City had gone? Yes, she just took and evaporated not that noir style for which I loved the first two films of the trilogy, now Gotham is an ordinary boring metropolis, which is simply not interesting to watch. Why was this done or why? There are no answers, alas, it's sad. Well, the last point is an actor's game. Yes, I did not expect something outstanding. In principle, there was nothing outstanding on the screen, all that was that good actors gave out a good game and in sum with the above described it looked again extremely boring and not interesting. It's time to sum up and draw some conclusions. This picture is the weakest in the filmography of a good director Christopher Nolan. As it is not surprising, but basically the script was let down, of course, as a result of which the whole film is simply impossible to watch, the atmosphere and appeal were lost as in the two previous parts of the trilogy. Who can recommend this film, well, probably only to fans of superhero cinema and comic book fans. To all other lovers of good cinema, this film is by no means worth watching. I have everything."
"In my opinion I think this is the best movie of Nolan's Batman trilogy. It's more interesting, enjoyable and emotional. The acting performance is brilliant and the cast has been chosen perfectly. The end is one of the most beautiful endings I've seen, it's phenomenal and remarkable. All things about this movie will still in my memory because it's simply a great masterpiece and I really loved it. Finally if you haven't seen this trilogy yet then I can definitely recommend it."
"I feel The Dark Knight Rises is the best of Nolan's Trilogy in overall entertainment. The hallmark of this series is its dark, gritty realism, at least as realistic as you can get for a superhero movie. I prefer this approach to the semi-goofy style of the 1989-97 series.

Bane's a formidable villain and Anne Hatheway surprisingly plays a good ""Catwoman"" (I say ""surprisingly"" only because I thought she has too innocent/sweet of a quality to pull off the role). Also on hand is Marion Cotillard, who's stunning as Miranda Tate, and Joseph Gordon-Levite, who's effective as police officer Blake. Beyond these we get the principal characters/cast of the first two films, minus the Joker and Harvey Dent.

My only beef with this series is that the plots are convoluted and there's an overload of characters, which means you really have to pay attention or you'll get lost in the process. This is never a problem when a story is ultra-compelling, but none of these films are, although ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is definitely the most compelling of the three. This factor is what keeps this series from being great in my opinion.

But don't take that the wrong way; I'm just being honest. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a quality Batman film.

The film runs 165 minutes and was shot in Pittsburgh (Gotham City), England, Scotland, India, Italy, New York, Newark and California.

GRADE: B+"
"Bane, who sounds like modern day activists who claims to give authority to everyone, wants to distribute everything to everyone and ends up making them indirectly slaves of the authority. On the other hand it shows Bruce really becoming the hero without mask, he learns that fear is good to have as it makes one stronger and vigilant. The way this story is narrated is surreal. For me this is the peak Batman. The character arcs are shown in way, where you can connect with them, the way it shows that all you need is courage to fight the tyranny and heroes do have flaws too. Such superhero movies are gone now in the era of over preaching content and heavy visuals."
Catwoman was mind-blowing..! I saw 3 together..batman begins...dark knight ..and dark knight rises..as per rating dark knight is the best...but in my point of view...this is the best......loved the theory
"The Dark Knight Rises, though not as good as the previous one- The Dark Knight, is fitting for the series finale. In this one, you have Bane and he has great presence throughout the movie and good rivalry with Batman. This one is more about the story and I felt as though this was closer to Batman Begins, as if completing a full circle. In BB, we had Bruce Wayne transform into the Batman and here too he again ""learnt"" to be Batman. He realized that after 8 years of no life at all, he couldn't just don the mask and the cape and become Batman. He again faces fear, learns to overcome it and gets his training in a way.

This movie had a feeling of completeness which is very necessary when the series has ended. The Dark Knight ends in Batman being villain in people's eyes and in this one he literally ""rises""."
This film has the misfortune to be a sequel to one of the greatest films of all time. The Dark Knight is no easy act to follow. However Nolan does an amazing job of adding spectacle to make the final installment of the trilogy memorable. The realism has always made this series stand above the rest. Are there some plot holes? Yes. Do they make it a bad film? No. Go watch Justice League then honestly tell me TDKR is bad. It's not. It is simply over shadowed by its predecessor.
Oh my god this movie was awesome !.and what an amazing ending to a superb trilogy.this movie Can't get better the story the cast everything is just too perfect.and no one is better than Chrestian Bale for this movie he is a very talented actor with a really special acting skills.i am confused why anyone well hate this movie its one of the best movie for all ages ! in my opinion its the best action movie of 2012.and of course the well directing and superb special effects of the movie makes it more amazing.what a blockbuster movie is this.this movie is no doubt a most watch and best of the year and it deserved an Oscar at least.
"Christopher Nolan concludes his epic vision of the Batman franchise in high style, as Christian Bale returns as the caped crusader, after masked henchman Bane threatens to destroy Gotham. This stuff is candy for superhero aficionados, and Nolan manages to balance a large cast without shortchanging anyone. Drawn from his slumber by mysterious cat burglar Selina Kyle, the Batman faces what may be his biggest and most dangerous test yet as Bane wields a nuclear explosive and threatens to detonate. Secrets from the past are revealed, and loose ends tied. Tremendous support from Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Mariana Cotilliard, and others. This is a film to make you stand up and cheer. Fun comic fable, perhaps not up to the standard of the prior classic, but does amazing things with it's large budget and well worth viewing."
"The action was pretty mediocre at best. The plot was decent but most things were pretty predictable. Even the ""surprise"" evil villain at the end was predictable. During the movie I turned to my girlfriend and said ""$20 says she ends up being a bad guy at the end."" needless to say I got a pat on the head later.

Is the movie good? Yes. Is the movie great? Depends.... it is great for the fans of the movies but in general its not a masterpiece. I feel it deserve a 8 on IMDb at the very best. The fact that its so high rated right now is pretty unrealistic.

Everyone saying Bane was the greatest villain of all time with amazing acting? I disagree... I still think Heath did a better job as the Joker. I feel Bane was a cool character but I don't feel he at all lived up to the hype provided in other reviews.

The movie is a must see for the year, but it is something you can watch on DVD and still get the same effect. No idea how they spent so much money on this movie... the action wasn't that good."
"Christopher Nolan is the greatest film maker of all time. Big statement, I know. But let's think about that statement for a second... he has not made a bad film (Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins, The Prestige, The Dark Knight, Inception and his earlier work Following) So how does such a brilliant film maker finish off a trilogy that changed super hero movies forever, which included one of the greatest films (in any genre - The Dark Knight) of all time?

The Dark Knight Rises is the conclusion the trilogy deserves. Is it better than The Dark Knight? That's debatable. It's a very different type of movie. But it is the movie that was needed to end this trilogy, it's the movie that Batman fans will appreciate and love for years and years to come.

Christopher Nolan has just possibly made the greatest movie trilogy of all time."
"The unprecedented fervor surrounding the release of the final Batman film of Christopher Nolan's highly acclaimed trilogy is something we probably should have seen coming. Fans of the films are rabid about the movies getting their just dues, and it's become the (unfortunate) habit of many a fanboy to go ballistic on anyone who is a naysayer. That said, these people are devotees of the series for a reason: each of the two previous offerings have been nothing short of fantastic, and there was no reason to believe that the third—and final—installment, The Dark Knight Rises, would be any different.

The question that's on everyone's mind, of course, is if it really does meet (and ultimately exceed) the impossibly high standards set by its predecessors. The answer is a resounding ""yes."" The Dark Knight Rises is incredibly ambitious and incredibly satisfying; it's also the best film of the trilogy.

Allow me to explain why.

In both Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, Gotham was in peril. Madmen assailed the city's citizens for varying reasons—some more concrete than others—while a troubled hero in Bruce Wayne sought to use his resources (namely access to incredibly advantageous weaponry and a whole slew of kick-assery he obtained while a brief member of the League of Shadows) to disarm those would see the town destroyed. While his character has always been interesting, Bruce Wayne hasn't been a truly engrossing dramatic figure. That all changes with The Dark Knight Rises.

Here, we see Bruce/Batman's tragedy and redemption come around full circle. At the start of the movie, Wayne is a man crippled by the exploits he's undertaken as the caped crusader. He's a recluse who's holed up in Wayne Manor. As we're allowed to see him move beyond exchanging witty barbs with his longtime butler (and caretaker) Alfred Pennyworth, the emotional pay-dirt finally emerges, and the character—in the words of the late Ra's Al Ghul—becomes more than just a man. He becomes the embodiment of grief; here, it's clear that there's a tangible psychological block that's eating Bruce from the inside out. The first hour of Rises is devoted to mining this pain, and it makes Bale's portrayal of Bruce more accessible than ever.

Then there's the action, which hits its stride about halfway through the production. Once it gets going, it's relentless and, for lack of a better word, harrowing. Everything that's happening in the streets of Gotham has weight behind it, as the city faces a challenge unlike anything that's come before.

I feel like I'm on the verge of spilling the beans about some major plot points, so I'll wind things down by saying that the supporting cast—Tom Hardy as Bane and Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle—are all splendid. They each bring something crucial to their characters, and not a moment of screen time is wasted.

I don't need to tell you this, but if you haven't already purchased your ticket for Nolan's epic conclusion to what will go down as one of the best trilogies in movie history, then you need to get on the ball. After all, this is one of those rare occurrences in cinema—the emergence of a truly great movie that actually lives up to every ounce of hype.

Nicely done, Mr. Nolan. You deserve the Oscar nods that are surely coming your way."
"Never has a comic book film make you care about the main character especially throughout a trilogy, these movies should be viewed as one big film, it all adds up and comes to full circle in this one. The acting alone in this movie hits you hard and when Bane appears on the screen it's nail biting. From Christian Bale, Tom Hardy, Ann Hathaway, Michael Caine, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Gary Oldman the list goes on and they make this movie well worth it.

You really feel for Bruce Wayne the most in this movie (because its a batman film) and the ending has the best pay off ever and is very emotional and satisfying. One of the best things about this movie is when you watch it more than once you pick up on things you may have missed which i find more gratifying in a movie, its like watching it all over again and those movies to me are the best, its definitely not a one and done type of movie so you get your moneys worth. This movie definitely deserves the praise it has. Its going to be a long time until someone makes a comic book trilogy as brilliant as this one. Thank you Nolan."
"The special fx and action scenes were cool. The acting by the badguy was not that great. One of the reasons for that was the mask he is wearing. You cant really see the facial expressions and also the voice acting was clearly recorded in studio afterwards. The bad guy visually looking is really cool. The badguy is not that great compared to the previous movie where heat ledger really carried the movie, tom hardy doesn't. Also the storyline and screenplay wasn't that good. They tried to put to much info in to short a time. The characters where a bit shallow because of that, they lacked depth. All in all the movie was entertaining, but not as much as expected."
"First things first. Bane is not the Joker. While the Joker was chaotic,Baneis a mercenary. Ruthless and destructive. When the prologue was shown during MI4, many had voiced concerns about the muffled voice of Bane.That has been corrected to an extent.For those who don't follow comic books,Bane is the villain who broke the bat. And Tom Hardy has done justification to Bane. Mind you when there is a mask covering your face and you sound as a megaphone, it makes your job a little difficult. But his physical presence and his eyes expresses what needs to be expressed.

Before you walk into the theatre, ensure that you seen the previous two films from the trilogy as the story of TDKR is interconnected to both and you may feel lost if you haven't seen them. For those who have , it wouldn't harm to review those films again. Whilst The Dark Knight earned respect and love from worldwide audience mostly due to fact that Heath Ledger was brilliant as the Joker. And his character shines way above Batman's or the story itself, TDKR on the other hand relies more on the story and the inter-relationship of the characters.

Nolan stands true to his word. It is an EPIC conclusion to the Batman trilogy. it is worthy of multiple viewings and I would suggest an IMAX viewing if possible. The scenes, the canvas are breathtaking. So are all the action scenes and of course Mr.Zimmer on the keyboard. The soundtrack fits right into the scenes and enhances the visual experience. The newly added star cast further adds to that experience and fit right into the master puzzle that Nolan has created while his old allies ensure that the movies moral compass is pointed in the right direction. The movie justifies its length of 165 mins and you won't realise how fast they went.

For me the experience would have been far more richer had I not seen Inception or any other Nolan films. Let me explain. Many of the movie scenes are executed and directed on the same lines as Inception. And since I understand how Nolan's concept works, I knew all the twist and turns before they were revealed barring one. The element of surprise wasn't there for me. TDKR is a must watch. And it is a just end to the best comic book adapted movie series ever. Enjoyed it and loved it. Rating 8/10."
"Following a movie event like Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" (2008) is a dangerous game, but then Nolan is a dangerous player. His curious obsession with masculine identity, psychological schisms and the dark night of the soul gave ""Batman Begins"" (2005) a sense of edgy 'reality' that ingratiated him to critics and a good deal of the public, even if it alienated some hard-core Batfans with its customized and highly Nolan-esque take on the Caped Crusader. When his second installment braved the frontier of openly post-9/11 superhero parables, and in so doing gave the late Heath Ledger platform to truly wow audiences and critics the world over, the British director seemed to have galvanized 'superhero noir' as the new benchmark in comic book film adaptation. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012) is his final word on the subject, and while this reviewer feels that it is not a film fit to win over any dissenters or greatly deter any fanatics, it is very largely successful in what it tries to do and its failings are certainly not for a lack of trying.

The first hour or so of the film is a whirlwind of plot necessities that, despite the running time of 165 minutes, probably needed another half an hour or so to unfold with sensicality. They involve introductions to John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) - a rookie cop raised in a city orphanage who apparently ""still believes in the Batman"", even though as far as the audience is concerned he may as well have just moved to Gotham last week – Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) – a cat-burglar who is therefore Catwoman – and Miranda Tate (Marion Cottilard) – a high society Gothamite monetarily invested in a renewable energy program at Wayne Enterprises that has apparently gone bust, even though it seems to work just fine. Excusing a twist in the tale that seems to be there for its own sake, however, Nolan and his co-screenwriter (also known as his brother Jonathan) do not really abide loose ends, and by the commencement of the film's some hour-long climax all the story elements that feel disparate and murky in the beginning have intertwined and solidified into the kind of philosophically powerhouse narrative that made the first two films so effective.

What makes the Nolan films effective is how they appropriated the inalienable tenets of the Batman legend in pursuit of an apocalyptic allegory about the post-9/11 western world. ""Batman Begins"" was a film about fear; the double edged nature of fear's power over a people and how the conquering of fear is invaluable for the pilgrimage of moral valor. ""The Dark Knight"" was a film about Terror, the kind George Bush Jr. declared war against in the early twenty-first century, and about how the greatest tool against Terror is the adherence to moral principles, even if sacrifice and compromise must be allowed for.

""The Dark Knight Rises"" provides a more accurate depiction of terroristic motives in its central villain of Bane than the ""The Dark Knight"" did with The Joker, because he holds Gotham in contempt for its status as a symbol of American first-world 'imperialism'. There has been some critical backlash against Bane as a Villain Without A Face, but this severely undermines Tom Hardy's performance, which actually achieves remarkable presence through nothing but body-language, vocal theatricality and disturbingly expressive eyes. Even without a face, Hardy effortlessly paints a convincing portrait of one who wants to dismantle the lie of Harvey Dent's legacy and incite Gotham into class-warfare riots. He purports to ""liberate"" Gotham's people, but his ultimate goal is to feed Gotham false hope before destroying the whole darn thing and everyone in it. Bane's genuine ideological conflict with western civilization is centered around the power of hope in the eventuation of despair. More than it is a film about fear or Terror, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a film about hope.

In accord with the rest of the trilogy, Bruce Wayne is not the only protagonist whose arc is built around the movie's central thematic concepts. Even the arc supplied for Selina Kyle ends up justifying her seemingly arbitrary insertion into this filmic imagining by providing a suitably dubious object of moral faith for the fallen Dark Knight. She begins with similar outlook to Bane, but the Nolans don't buy into Ra's Al Ghul's assertion that criminals aren't complicated. Everyone, and everything, is complicated.

Oddly enough, it's this principle that is behind most of the shortcomings of the film. It's a little *too* complicated, with the rushed series of first-act events seriously paling in comparison to the emotional impact of the conclusion, and an aforementioned twist that doesn't make much sense. There are also a lot more impossible feats performed by Bruce Wayne here than before, including a near-superhuman healing ability. And where ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"" stood alone very effectively, one can't help but feel that both films are practically required viewing for this one.

But none of that really outweighs the sheer, touching veracity of this finale and its philosophical/moral ambitions, which are all up to par with the predecessors and pay off a great deal of things with a genuine craftsmanship. This ""Batman"" series has always been about the power of symbols in a corrupted world and personal accountability in a society of structural shackles, and when Batman returns to Gotham at the top of the final act to brand his symbol in flames upon the city's largest bridge structure, we are reminded of the paradoxical purity of his message. Even as part of a system that is broken, even funded by a wealth that would perhaps do more good dispersed amongst the third world, even if no one ever knows his name, the Batman fights for the goodness of fallen people (be they cops, cat-burglars or orphans) who may otherwise have never had the chance to rise."
"This movie has everything you could want all while wrapping up one of the best film trilogies. As far as bad guys go Bane is pretty much the epitome of the character type. I personally feel the villains in the trilogy is what makes them so special. The story is great and engaging, it was so good I didn't even realize that the runtime was over 2 hours. If you like dark, gritty, and/or action movies its a must watch. Also it should be noted that you should watch the first 2 films in the series otherwise some stuff might not add up. It wraps up everything in the trilogy and answers pretty much every question you could have. How it relates back to the first movie is quite impressive and after watching this one you'll probably try your best 'bane impression.' His voice is as memorable as his stature. So even if you don't like Batman you must watch it for Bane because he is that amazing. Props to Tom Hardy on his out of the park performance."
"First of all, can I say that when I heard that the Joker wasn't going to be in this movie and that the lead ""bad guy"" was going to be Bane I was thinking ""LAME"". So I tried to go into watching this film with an open mind and I got to say I won't question Chris Nolan's casting, direction or choice of characters again anytime soon. The man is a master and did a masterful job in this third installment of the Batman saga. Bane is an enemy in which Batman has not yet seen, he's physically strong sure but his genius and ruthlessness is truly what's terrifying. He breaks Batman time and again until you almost question whether Batman can really beat him in the end (which is saying something, because we all know he has to right?). The choices of the other actors like Anne Hathaway were spot on, she was magnificent and nailed the cat women character this movie required to succeed. Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Christian Bale were their own usual selves (exceptional) and I really didn't see anyone miscast or turn in anything other then a very strong performance. Overall this movie left me completely happy, the perfect ending to the perfect movie saga. These are not just great super hero movies, to me they're great films period."
"The Dark Knight Rises was my favorite film of the year and from the Dark Knight trilogy.I was looking forward to this movie and it didn't disappoint me.

Positive:epic action scenes ,great acting performances, very good villain emotional ending ,inspiring movie

Negative: some plot wholes that didn't affect me.

Overall the movie was fantastic and I think that it is the one of the best movies ever made.Long live the Batman! Eight years on, a new evil rises from where the Batman and Commissioner Gordon tried to bury it, causing the Batman to resurface and fight to protect Gotham City... the very city which brands him an enemy"
"Am not a great FAN of Super Hero movies, but Nolan Changed the entire mindset. Of course the Film has a lot of loop holes and glitches but that doesn't take away the edge of the seat thrilling heartbeat experience. What i loved most was the way a simple comic story was presented on the screen. I really appreciate Nolan's creativity and presentation.What one needs was an awesome experience and not 100% logic to Action movies. The film stand all amid all minor glitches. The film has a lot of positives, The way Bruce & Tom Hardy character was portrayed, The way Real New York city was presented, The way the Whole experience stood at the end especially Bruce climbing out of the Well. Hans Zimmer Played a wonderful part in giving a master piece. All in All i would recommend everyone to watch whether they like it or not but for the cinematic experience it gives in the end. A Comic Super Hero Movie depicted magnificently after a lot of flops earlier. Nolan has silently conveyed that he is the right man who can do it."
"I just love a good superhero movie, so I happily saw the two Tim Burton offerings (""Batman"" & ""Batman Returns"") and even the pair of inferior Joel Schumacher works (""Batman Forever"" & ""Batman & Robin"") before thoroughly enjoying the British director Christopher Nolan's ""Batman Begins"" (2005) and ""The Dark Knight"" (2008). Four years later, Nolan - who again co-wrote and co-produced - is back with the final and longest part of his acclaimed trilogy. The expectations were very high and Nolan does not disappoint (and deserves particular thanks for not using 3D).

The opening sequence - which I saw in an early trailer - is terrific and almost the best thing in the film and Nolan makes sure that the rest of the story races along with verve and tension, aided by Hans Zimmer's incessant, throbbing score.

It's eight years after the last film and Bruce Wayne (once more the talented Christian Bale) is a broken man, physically, psychologically and even financially. Two contrasting characters arrive in Gotham City to draw him out of retirement: a slinky cat thief (well played by Anne Hathaway who has the most humorous lines) and arch villain Bane (a fearsome-looking Tom Hardy whose lines are unfortunately muffled by his face mask). The Bane character may not be in quite the same chilling class as the brilliant Heath Ledger as The Joker, but Catwoman is a splendid addition to the cast list.

I didn't always understand what was going on - a recent viewing of the two previous films might have helped (who remembers the League of Shadows?) - and I saw it with a friend who was enjoying it for the second time and found the plot more intelligible, so that may be encouragement - if any was needed - to catch it again sometime. But the film always looks wonderful and the action is exciting and unrelenting, satisfyingly alternating from brutally visceral fighting between Batman and Bane to the deployment of some heavy hardware including a bat bike and a bat helicopter.

So, now that Nolan has triumphantly completed his trilogy, does this mean that the crusader is hanging up his cape? No way. The money to be made by continuing the franchise and the setting up of the Robin character (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) means that some other director will soon receive the call from Warner Brothers ..."
"""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012) is the third and final film in Christopher Nolan's trilogy about the comic book superhero Batman, created in 1939 by Bill Finger and Bob Kane. The franchise, starting in 2005 with ""Batman Begins"" and continuing in ""The Dark Knight"" (2008) is brought to a conclusion, and traditional Hollywood thinking is used by the Warner Bros. Studio here: everything is bigger, louder and more explosive and with higher stakes than before. Yet this expansionism hasn't translated into greater quality; if anything, it is the most flawed of the trio. Continuity errors, plot holes and logic defying events plague the film incessantly. The screenplay, by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, feels like it is two or three drafts away from being a finished product. Geopolitical significance is constantly strived for, especially in the latter part of the film, yet it fails to fully grasp its own half-articulated ideas and ends feeling like the pat, smug ""safe"" hawkish ideologies of a studio executive more interested in profit margins than ideas. All these mistakes are a repetition of the previous entry in the series; in many ways this perfectly encapsulates Hollywood: nothing forgotten, nothing learnt.

Still, Nolan's direction is as impressive as ever, really delivering in the large scale set pieces that dot the picture. He brings a real energy to the screen that almost papers over the cracks in the story. The dynamic action scenes are hardly original though and the opening sequence is straight out of a James Bond movie.

The acting is generally of a high standard, with Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Tom Hardy all very good. Unfortunately, the Oscar winning Marion Cotillard is given nothing to do and struggles to create a performance out of a poorly written character.

The cinematography by Academy Award winner Wally Pfister is good and a cut above the usual standard found in the average superhero blockbuster, the same of which can be said for the editing by Lee Smith and the booming music score of Hans Zimmer.

If then this climax to the Batman series is a disappointment, torpedoed by a below par script, then at least Christopher Nolan directs so well that you will be immersed in the film to the point where perhaps you will be more forgiving of its flaws and be swept along by this enjoyable spectacle."
"Wow. Christoper Nolan's third Batman-film is certainly not praised without good reasons, I assure you. The film leaves you speechless, the action combined to great actors and twisty plot, it's just pure beauty. Cannot say any negative thing about this film. Was surpirsed to see so many great actors, including old Stargate-star Christopher Judge in the side role. Can't give away much, so I'm not writing any more. I'm just saying, watch it as soon as you can!"
"The disappointment of the year. could not imagine the duo of nolan brothers getting it wrong. this movie should have been titled "" Cat woman and Bane"" because Batman is just an impotent shadow of his old time over here. Cat woman aka Selina Kyle is given the major amount of the screen time and Hathway is a pretty competent Catwoman. Bane(Tom Hardy) is unfortunately all masked up so he can convey the menace only from the way he walks or talks in that Irish lilt. Michael Caine is excellent in the scenes he is in and so is Morgan Freeman. Marion cotillard is totally wasted. i could not really understand the necessity for her character in the movie and also could not fathom why an Oscar winning actor like her would go for such a two bit role. Joseph Gordon Lewitt creases his forehead throughout the movie and that is pretty much all he does. Christian Bale is above average but he cannot lift a screenplay which is weak and predictable from the very beginning. the only bright spot about the movie is its music which is better than the previous installments. This movie is a disappointment when considered in seclusion. when compared with The Dark Knight and Batman Begins, it is a f**king disaster. very very unhappy."
"That Completes the trilogy.. Just came out from 'The Dark Knight Rises'...Not as mesmerizing as The Dark Knight ,but still Christopher Nolan executed a legendary ending to the series with breathtaking visual moments and fine performances..the movie takes off slowly ,bt the racy 2nd half s just stunning...Hans Zimmer 's score is brutal, percussive and ma ear drums was busting , the Bane Chant wherever he used was goosebumps..Christian Bale continued his legacy in the third part too.. Tom Hardy was a beefy substitute for Heath Ledger in a hell of a villain as the merciless and destructive evil.. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman reprise's there roles as strong as it's been throughout the series.. Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a fair job as the detective and he s a promising actor and the shocking 'Rise' was Marion Cotillard as 'Miranda Tate'..Anne Hatheway as CatWoman was just a sidekick and nothing much performance wise from her We may never see superhero films quite like these again, and that's fine.Nolan had ended on his own terms..If plans arise to reboot the ""Batman"" films a few years from now, I wish you luck. The bar is as high as it could possibly be... Must Watch for all Dark Knight and Nolan and movie lovers..!!"
"one of the most rewarding movies not only for having a realistic life story but also for watching a true hero who gets up on his feet at the end regardless how badly hurt ed he was he's still there

a true hero don't always have to had super powers but rather a Strong willing heart to take the right decisions at the right time & knows when to quit.

never give up

accept the truth about your self

even super heroes must know the feeling of fear sometimes to be true heroes"
"Billionaire Bruce Wayne once said, ""I am moreit's what you do that defines you."" The question is: what defines us all? The fire has risen and that fire has been put out, but not yet though. One thing still remains: Is there a future for the billionaire playboy? Enough about playboys, let's chat about how we got here.

In 2005, we were re-introduced to a boy who fell down a well and we saw what frightened him the most – bats. But he overcame that fear and struck fear into the hearts of those that knew the very existence of fear. Fighting against the mob, Batman took down the biggest crime lords of Gotham City – Carmine Falcone and gave the Scarecrow a taste of his own medicine.

But in 2008, the war was not over, not even by a landslide. As Bruce Wayne was having battles of his own, Batman was posed as a threat to the city and plus a mastermind of theatricality, a brain as the size of a laughing matter, brought a new taste in life – SLAUGHTER WAS THE BEST MEDICINE! The Joker (RIP Heath!), portrayed one of the darkest villains of all time as he brought down upon the city and the new DA Harvey Dent and gave the word ""light"" a new name.

Now we come to 2012, no one expected this to come to a conclusion, we thought we were in it for the long haul. Let's just say it was bittersweet and a whole lot of punches and back breaking. The ultimate villain, Bane, gave violence a new name. A name that was synomous unlike any other. But Bane was not working alone. An arch-enemy came back to finish a job but through someone else. And the black was faded and billionaire was living his life and moving on. But wait something red approaches, something that will fly red colors – is it a red monster, is it a red wagon, no it is a RED ROBIN.

For 8 years, the mastermind of Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathon gave Batman a new look and took the story to a whole new level. Thank you for teaching us that it is what we do that defines us. Christian Bale – you gave us an icon to live up to, you taught us to live for ourselves. Thank you. From Cillian Murphy to Tom Wilkinson to the late Heath Ledger to Aaron Eckhart to Tom Hardy to Anne Hathaway to Marion Cotillard – you guys defined evil. Thank you.

Batman will live in our hearts for years to come."
"I'll start by saying two things: 1. I am a huge Batman fan, in all shapes and sizes (well, except the Joel Schumacher movies); I read the comics, watched the animated series and movies and the live action movies 2. I am intelligent enough to spot plot holes, unrealistic action scenes and 'forced' plot devices.

With those disclaimers in mind, most people who criticize this film would imagine I must hate it. And, yet, it's quite the opposite.

I've just finished watching this for the 3rd time in 2 years. Yes, it's true that, the more often you watch it, the easier it is to spot things that seem off. To look at the details and to start questioning.

But...I really don't care. None of that makes this movie any less special for me. Because, truly, this movie goes to such emotional depths and gets you so in touch with the heart of what it means to be the Batman, that anything else is overshadowed.

The appeal and curse of Batman as a character is that he is human. He suffers and makes mistakes. He can be broken. He doesn't have super strength or the ability to fly. What he does have, beyond the training and the money and being 'the world's greatest detective', is his determination. His unwavering motivation to fight and win for his cause, to make Gotham safe at any cost. That's his superpower - never giving up.

And, on top of that, he has a lot of pain and trauma; the kind that any human being will experience, at some point in their life, that is now out in the open for anyone to sympathize with.

For capturing those things and putting them on screen so beautifully, I am grateful to Mr. Nolan."
"The Dark Knight Rises (2012) is my third best movie. Anne Hathaway was awesome fantastic as Catwoman she portrayed her by comic books the way she was. Michelle Pfeiffer did not do the job by portraying Catwoman by comic books but she did knew how to hit back. Bane played by Tom Hardy was absolutely fantastic terrorist. The Dark Knight Rises is pretty good awesome movie! The third Christopher Nolan film is very bashed and criticized by fan boys of Burton films saying it isn't good as Burton Batman films were. I love The Dark Knight Rises a little much better than Batman Returns, but those 4. films I reviewed will be my four favorite films. Schumacher films suck and they aren't my favorite films.

Anne Hathaway's performance is a worth of watch in this movie. Selina Kyle was written straight from the comic books the way her origins were. I love her in this movie she was well portrayed by Anne Hathaway, the way she was written in a comic books. Christian Bale still lighten us all up in his performance as Batman/Bruce Wayne. Matthew Modine and Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a wonderful performances in their co starring roles. This movie still has a plot holes like Batman dies in the end but he doesn't, Bruce Wayne survives. Alfred disappears magically during half of this movie and he show's up on the end of the movie. Anne Hathaway did a much, much better job than Michelle Pfeiffer did. Bane was a scary villain but still a good comic book portrayed villain the way he was. Tom Hardy was truly great in his performance as the main villain Bane. Seriously I have enjoyed this movie much better as a I did Batman Begins. Still The Dark Knight is the best one of all Batman Films. A good conclusion to end the trilogy.

The Dark Knight Rises is a 2012 British-American epic superhero film directed by Christopher Nolan, who co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Jonathan Nolan, and the story with David S. Goyer. Featuring the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the final installment in Nolan's Batman film trilogy, and the sequel to Batman Begins (2005) and The Dark Knight (2008).

Taking place eight years after the events of ""The Dark Knight"", the film follows Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) once more as he is forced to come out of self-imposed exile when a new evil rises in Gotham. This time around, the Caped Crusader must face off against his most dangerous enemy yet, a ruthless masked crime lord known as Bane (Tom Hardy), who will stop at nothing to bring chaos to the city. He must also deal with the arrival of a mysterious cat burglar named Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), as well as his inner demons. He may have defeated the Joker, but does Batman even stand a chance against Bane?

Eight years after the Joker's reign of anarchy, the Dark Knight is forced to return from his imposed exile to save Gotham City from the brutal guerrilla terrorist Bane with the help of the enigmatic Catwoman.

It's hard to imagine a time when a Christopher Nolan-helmet Batman film wasn't a sure thing. Yes it does.

Warner Bros. Pictures' and Legendary Pictures' ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is the epic conclusion to filmmaker Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy.

Christopher Nolan's concluding vision of the legendary Caped Crusader may just possibly go down as one of the strongest closing chapters to any franchise in modern cinema. Not only is it one of the most entertaining blockbusters of the year, but it also expands upon the Batman saga in a way that keeps you both emotionally and intellectually invested until the very end. With its top-notch performances, breathless score, solidly engrossing storyline, and action-packed set pieces, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" ends the franchise on a satisfying high note, delivering one of the most powerfully engrossing climaxes in recent memory. Anne Hathaway also deserves major props for her portrayal of the cunning Catwoman, who (in my opinion) is even more striking than Michelle Pfeiffer.

Although ""The Dark Knight Rises"" never truly reaches the same groundbreaking heights as its predecessor, I loved every minute of it. The fantastic storytelling, the gritty visuals, the brilliant character development. There's nothing here that isn't worthy of praise in my book. Nolan truly capped off his one-of-a-kind superhero trilogy in a way that no other director could've accomplished. Sure, the narrative can get a bit messy at times, but when compared to everything else the film does right, it hardly matters. I don't recommend this film , because it isn't for everyone. But for any fan of dark, gritty, action-packed filmmaking it is.

R.I.P. to all the victims of the Theater Massacre in Aurora, Colorado. They will be missed.

"The Dark Knight Rises is a 2012 action film directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Oscar-winning Christian Bale as Batman and Tom Hardy as Bane. It was a box office success with total earnings more than $1 billion.

Eight years after the events of The Dark Knight, Batman seems to have retired. But when a new evil force named Bane arrives in Gotham and intends to destroy the city, Batman has to rise again. His allies are few, but he is willing to do whatever it takes to save his city and its people...

One of the best features of the film is its special effects; also why I enjoyed it so much. They were all amazingly good, with the stadium explosion being one of the top movie scenes this year!

What's more, another point I have to mention is the acting; Bale is as convincing as ever, while Hardy is the perfect villain. The rest of the cast, including Anne Hathaway as Catwoman and Gary Oldman as Comissioner Gordon remains at its finest.

All in all, I found the film more enjoyable than any other this year. So, don't waste time-grab your popcorn, your friends and watch it. In my opinion though, you should already have done so!"
"If you've had enough of Batmen because of the likes of Val Kilmer and George Clooney, then you haven't enjoyed Christian Bale in director Christopher Nolan's trilogy of Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, and now the superior Dark Knight Rises. Bale brings the anguish and triumph of a real human being who suffers and overcomes his sorrows to fight the forces of evil—the American way.

While that way is too often by way of violence in movies, this iteration, where Bruce Wayne returns from self-exile to fight the fearful Bane (Tom Hardy), is more often punctuated by intelligence (in weapon designs and mostly in strategy). In fact, the violence is frequently mundane fist fighting, almost as if to emphasize guile over missile. Sadly, the two battles between Batman and Bane are so dull that I longed for CGI to elevate the sophistication. Body blows hardly satisfy in this high-tech world.

Characteristic of Nolan, the bad guys are memorable and formidable: Bane has a mask to remind us of Darth Vader with his power and darkness, actually coming from a pit of darkness as if from some Poe-like tale of terror; Catwoman (Anne Hathaway) is witty, slippery, and mercurial while sporting a figure Hathaway must have worked hard to fashion; and the surprise villain, well, is more vicious than the others because of the ultimate disguise (not to be disclosed here for fear of my being thrown into the naughty-critic pit).

Then there's Alfred (Michael Caine), Bruce Wayne's faithful servant, whose soul is almost as tortured as Wayne's. Caine is called on to shed a few tears, which are more believable than all the CGI machines. I wouldn't be surprised if Caine gains an Oscar nomination for supporting role (he won two Oscars already). As for Joseph Gordon-Levitt's cop, John Blake, he is subtly effective in gaining our sympathy so that he is guaranteed to return in the next Batman production.

I am unusually effusive about the acting because it is so good, but I should not forget that themes are always prominent in this series. Global financial failure, loyalties, and warfare; and, of course, the ambiguity of human beings, symbolized by masks, keep this comic-book thriller from sinking in its own weight of explosions and bombast.

The Amazing Spider-Man impressed me a few weeks ago because it caught squarely the young person's challenges of self-centered arrogance and growing maturity thorough responsibility. Now The Dark Knight Rises shows the inner struggles of an adult hero racked with doubt, more inclined to forsake responsibility than to save humanity. As for the Avengers, it now looks like a showcase for costumes at a Comic-Con convention.

Nolan and Bale have caught the angst of adults everywhere who, when confronted with financial ruin or the need to defend their turf from alien forces, may bail out rather than face down the evils. Despite the questionably-long 164 minutes, the artists of this film have kept every minute interesting, fast-paced, and highly useful to develop a pride of heroes who should keep us entertained for at least next decade."
"I went to see the Dark Knight Rises last week and I have to say I was impressed. Story-wise it's a lot better than it's predecessors. The plot is coherent and has several interesting twists along the way that I won't spoil for you here. My only complaint is that it is a bit heavy going at some points. 3 hours is a long time, and I wouldn't go so far as to say boring, but it definitely takes a while to pick up the pace. However once it does you are in for a thrill ride.

Nolan did a fantastic job with the Characters, from the troubled Bruce Wayne/Batman to Catwoman to the antagonist Bane, as well as secondary characters such as Alfred and Gordon, they are all fleshed out beautifully and are very believable in respect to the source material. Supplemented by superb acting by the all star cast, I have no complaints here.

The direction is fantastic. As I said above, it takes a while to pick up, but it never ever get's boring. As soon as you start to think that, something happens that pulls you right back in. Nolan deserves to be commended for this. The action scenes are brilliantly done, the special effects are great, Hans Zimmer's score is, as always, superb, the editing and cinematography are crisp. There really is not much to complain about here.

In my personal opinion it is the best installment in the Nolan trilogy, and if you haven't seen it yet I can only recommend you do so as soon as possible."
"Didn't think this film lived up to the hype surrounding it. It was good, don't get me wrong but it didn't compare with the Dark Knight. Seemed too full of action and definitely violence, which obscured the story somewhat.However Christian Bale played a blinder again and he has definitely made the role his and his alone. Nobody would be able to compare to him. The ending was again a bit rushed and didn't really come as any surprise, and again this let down the overall film. Sets up another series, which would have to be exceptional to compare. But overall a let down and not a fitting end to this franchise. Let's hope the Man Of Steel (another DC offering) will strengthen the comic lines takings as the Green Lantern certainly didn't. Sorry, the Avengers will be the box office topper this year!"
"A mediocre comic book film. While decent at times, there are too many patches of poor dialog the bring out poor performances from the actors. While Bruce Wayne is reluctant to put back on the bat suit, Bale seems equally reluctant to put on his Bruce Wayne suit. His performance is entirely uninteresting and he never seems to recover any fire. 

Hathaway does a fair job, but she and Bale lack chemistry. A scene with Levitt is so poorly written and performed it is painful to watch. 

Bane is never menacing. It sounds like he is impersonating Jeremy Irons from Die Hard 3. He also does this ridiculous head shake during his speech, as if to insure the audience that he is speaking. 

The tie in to A Tale of Two Cities is obvious and ham fisted.  There is so little build up to the behavior the citizens quickly adopt that  it just fails to make itself plausible. While the personal sacrifice from A Tale of Two Cities makes that story powerful, the cop out in this film weakens the whole story.  

Some of the action scenes are pretty good. Some are just ridiculous. Batman always seems like some guy in a suit who is fighting a creepy guy with a mask. 

Overall this movie just fails to ever become compelling."
"You just don't watch a Nolan movie. You experience it. Something happens inside you after you're done watching any of his movies.

The Dark Knight Rises is not just a movie, its a baggage of expectations, its a sequel to The Dark Knight, it has been directed by Chris Nolan, it has the Batman and people have already started with their assumptions and speculations.

Does the movie survive all this?

Yes. Definitely yes.

Batman Begins dealt with fear. The Dark Knight dealt with chaos. The Dark Knight Rises deals with pain.

Eight years have been passed since the demise of Harvey Dent. Batman had hung up the boots and started blaming himself for Harvey's Death and everything. With all the injuries he had sustained while fighting under that bat suit and the depression, he is no longer the Bruce Wayne Gotham knows. People have been questioning his sanity. Wayne empire is declining.

In comes Bane. The dark, brutal, masked and monolithic beast who almost destroys Wayne enterprises to seek Batman.

Selina Kyle, a female burglar who teases Bruce Wayne with her attitude and activities.

As a result, Batman is forced to come back. What follows is the series of events that not only blow your mind away but cast a magical spell to last the full life time.

There are a several new players that have been introduced in the film, such as Wayne's love interest and the new age cop John Blake who does the job of being the good side kick of Gordon and plays in an important role in convincing Bruce Wayne to be back as the caped crusader to protect Gotham one last time from the terror of Bane and army.

So is The Dark Knight Rises better than The Dark Knight? If you were one of those fans who prefer Batman Begins to TDK then you'll find much to love about TDKR. And if you weren't then no Batman film will ever match TDK for you.

As both Batman and Bruce Wayne, Christian Bale's work here is master- class, and he gives the character such an inescapable melancholy – a certain perseverance in the face of absolute resignation to his fate – that he becomes a more tragic figure than ever. That said, he's aided enormously by a never-better Michael Caine, who turns with hope and palpable love what might otherwise be expository dialogue into searing, supportive criticisms of Wayne's self-destruction.

On the other hand, after being marketed as heir to the Joker in ""The Dark Knight,"" Tom Hardy's Bane is a different sort of villain – a focused and more ideologically-developed version of Heath Ledger's Joker – but one with equally ruthless charm.

While she doesn't quite steal the show as Heath Ledger's Joker did, Hathaway's Catwoman is a magnetic presence whenever she's on screen and she has great chemistry with Bale. Selina may be the proverbial good bad girl, the thief with a heart of gold, but Hathaway imbues her with a wounded spirit and a survivor's edge that makes her feel genuine and sympathetic even when she's being naughty.

That being said, the acts of good old Gary Oldman and the power house Joseph Gordon Levitt cannot be ignored.

Christopher Nolan is in peak time of his life. Whatever he is touching is turning into gold. He has taken The Batman series to a level which no one in thousand years can reach. The action scenes, the rise and the fall of all the characters along with the climax are just the pieces of the puzzle, which in the end you feel was taking shape since the day Batman Begins released. The first hour ties all the loose ends the first two movies left behind and the climax is so apt that you leave the theater feeling contended and satisfied.

We may never see superhero films quite like these again, and that's fine. Nolan had something special to say with his time in the trenches, and he's ended on his own terms.

I wonder which series Nolan decides to reboot next!"
"Firstly I will say that I loved Batman Begins. Then Christopher Nolan gave us The Dark Knight and I felt it was on a whole other level than Batman Begins. I went into the cinema to The Dark Knight Rises on the day of release with high expectations. These were blown away! I even went to see it at the cinema again and I've never done that before! (I understand other people saw it many more times but still a first for me)

The acting was absolutely superb! Christian Bale was at his very best playing Bruce Wayne/Batman. Michael Caine was brilliant as Alfred despite his short screen time and I feel the performance was Oscar nomination worthy. Anne Hathaway was a better Catwoman than I could have imagined. Joseph Gordon Levitt was really good as Blake. Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman were good as always playing Gordon and Fox. Marion Cotillard was good as Miranda as well. Finally Tom Hardy as Bane. I thought this was good casting from the start but I never imagined something quite this good! Tom Hardy stole the show for me just like Heath Ledger did in The Dark Knight. Bane is one of my favourite baddies of all time now and while it wasn't quite as good as The Joker, it was as close as it was ever going to come. Tom Hardy is worthy of an Oscar nom for his portrayal of Bane especially since he was restricted with the mask and had to convey emotions through eyes, voice and body language. There were a few moments where I couldn't understand his voice but sometimes it just took a few extra seconds to absorb it and his voice sounds too awesome to care anyway.

Wally Pfisters cinematography was incredible once again and I think I see another Oscar nomination for him.

Hans Zimmer's score was his greatest yet in my opinion and it really added to the emotional depth of the film and just got you into the film right from the start. Dare I say it another Oscar nomination?

Finally Christopher Nolan's Direction was incredible as always and I truly believe this to be his finest creation to date and he must get an Oscar nomination if not his first win, he definitely deserves it.

Overall this film was outstanding, one of the greatest films ever made,the finest of Nolan's Batman trilogy and the best superhero movie of all time. An Oscar nomination is deserved and I think any other film coming out this year will struggle to beat it."
"Is it a perfect film? No. It is a great blockbuster? Yes, it is. Tonally, The Dark Knight Rises rises above its predecessor in the trilogy, because it manages to balance the grounded in realism and comic book aspects into a tonally coherent work. In fact, though it still attempts to ground itself in reality, this is the most operatic and most bombastic of the Batman films. And, dear lord, does operatic work with the superhero genre. After all, at its true core, Batman, and the superhero genre, is inherently a ridiculous concept. I loved the ridiculous voice of Bane and Michael Cain's constant hamming it up, crying speeches.

In recent years, the JJ Abraham's school of film-making has gained currency. The film moving so fact to one scene to the next that the audience barely has time to register the illogical steps taken by the characters. This is evident in the 2009, Star Trek film. While Nolan does this, he does it with so much more panache that it transcends the narrative, editing weaknesses associated with this modern form of film- making. The Dark Knight Rises is a pure cinematic experience. It is a film that needs It is a film that needs to be experience in the big screen. Even the hand to hand fighting sequences-- an area that Christopher Nolan has struggled with in the past -- are exemplary; they are reminiscent of the slow light saber fights in the Old Trilogy.

The biggest problem with the film is that it does not developed the relationship between Marion Colitard's character and Bruce Wayne well enough; it feels too force. Another major problem with the film is the Howard Hughes segment, it which it is they only portion of the film that drags."
"First of all, the Dark Knight Rises in the concluding and final chapter in the critically acclaimed Christopher Nolan (Director) Dark knight Trilogy, and due to it being the predecessor to 2008's The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises was already overwhelmed with especially high expectations. However did it meet those expectations?

(Spoilers!)The Dark Knight Rises opens with an overwhelming plane aerial action sequence, an the introduction of Tom Hardy's representation of the character of Bane. Tom hardy's performance as Bane is constantly stimulating, both visually and mentally, possibly as stimulating as Heath ledger's representation of the Joker in The Dark Knight, however I do believe that Hardy's performance is heavily tainted by the way in which the character of Bane was ""removed"" from the film, during the final act of the film. Among the incredible five star performances of the cast from Anne Hathaway in her fitting performance as Catwoman to the emotional performance of Morgan Freeman, the acting was a driving force in the film's outstanding quality. The intense, emotional performances were essential to the film's sharp writing, great pacing throughout the story. Christopher Nolan's incredible flashback technique used to compose an incredible plot twist during the final act of the Film. It has been constantly noted that the film has an extensive amount of plot holes, however after analyzing the story, I do believe that many of the plot holes mentioned are very pedantic methods used by fans of other blockbusters such as The Avengers, to better their personal opinions, rather than explaining what they enjoyed about their own personal favorite, they would rather slander and taint The Dark Knight Rises.

However the film does have some relevant plot holes, which could have been resolved by additional footage, such as a director's cut or a three and a half hour edition of the film, I would have also been satisfied with a two part version of the film in which each part was two hours, or more in length. The film's combination of ""the chase"",and the ""the ticking time bomb"", during the final action sequence was an incredibly powerful sequence which kept me heavily invested in the outcome of the story, which climaxed with the most emotionally gripping moment in comic book film history, in my opinion. The supposed death of the Batman in the nuclear explosion, later denied by his alive appearance as Bruce Wayne, was a symbolic way to express how the death of Batman, allowed Bruce Wayne to Truly ""live"", while also leaving you wondering how he did it? Bruce Wayne's time in the underground prison was incredibly reminiscent of Batman Begins, as Bruce Wayne was forced re build his broken psyche, and truly become the Batman, physically and mentally; this also defined Bane to be both the greatest test for Batman mentally and physically but also the most important factor in Bruce becoming a truly righteous hero that Gotham deserves. And the final gift from Christopher Nolan the audience, was Joseph Gordon Levitt becoming the symbol of hope for Gotham as Wayne did in Batman Begins, leaving the audience understanding that the Batman is immortal in a metaphorical way, anyone with the will to do so can be Batman, in Nolan's cleverly and emotionally investing world. The Dark Knight Rises was a satisfying ending chapter to a greatly weaved masterpiece of a trilogy from start to finish. I would give The Dark Knight Rises 9.5/10, or an A+."
"I loved the Dark Knight. I loved its complexities, I loved its performances and I loved its direction. It was not only a great superhero film but a great film in general. Did they exactly need a conclusion to Batman's story? That's really not for me to decide, but they did it and in my opinion it ended in the best possible way. Not the best way, but the best possible way. This is an excellent film, it is excellent because it demonstrates everything that made the Dark Knight Trilogy complex, and because of Nolan's direction it made it even better. Christian Bale gives a fine performance as Batman, the theatrical voice is still there, but it's toned down. I could barely recognize Tom Hardy as Bane, the voice is a little much but he still does good nevertheless. I really don't get all the hate for Anne Hathaway, she's a good actress, regardless of what her ambitions might be, she did good in Les Miz but did well here. Joseph Gordon- Levitt did good as usual, and Gary Oldman Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman can do this in their sleep. The Dark Knight was what it was because it had a realism to it, this could definitely happen in real life, in regards to the Joker. The realism fades when Bane comes along but that's not a bad thing if the story is told well (and it is). If you've seen the Dark Knight, go see this, and if you're looking for a great movie go see this."
"When I saw the dark knight rises, I expected a villain who would be able to stand up to the acting which Heath Ledger had given in the dark knight. But I was disappointed with Bane's character even though Tom Hardy tried his best it didn't have the charm which the other two villains in the prequels had... Marion Cotillard didn't do what deserved of her role.. Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine had no new form or structure even after 8 years, people change with time.. and u need to show at least some change in their character.... The only people who showed justice to their roles were Anne Hathaway as catwomen and Christian Bale.... The story was nothing exceptional. But I say to the people don't expect anything like the The Dark Knight... Just an ordinary story, with an ordinary villain with no character devlopment like the Joker or Ra al gul... And a batman who can and at no point feels weaker in courage than then villain... Overall I give it a 6 for just Anne Hathaway and Christian Bale's performance with the direction of Nolan."
"""You are in for a show tonight!"" The dark knight rises one last time to save Gotham. This movie portrays batman at his most fragile self. Problems are everywhere while solutions in the abyss. Bruce is down with grief, Wayne empire is at all time low, Bane and his gang is taking over the city brick by brick. Bruce is faced with a choice to let Gotham die or rise to give some hope to its citizens who are interested in only one thing that they do best when threatened: own survival.

This movie is a perfect blend of, pain, struggle, sadness, suspense, action, loss, chaos, triumph, powerful lines, a number of great performances and above all a very good story.

Out of so many good ones if I need to choose a single stand out performance it would be Christian Bale, he has come a long way. This movie gave him a real chance to show what he is capable of as Bruce Wayne. Then comes Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, reviewing their performance would be like holding a candle to the sun so I won't. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ann Hathaway were perfect for their parts, I was a little doubtful of Hathaway but she managed to steal the frames a good number of times. While I missed a mind blowing performance like Heath, Tom Hardy as Bane managed to deliver a handful of terrifying moments and last but not the least what a great music.

A tiny issue I had was that first half took a little while to come to speed, but I guess it was necessary to build the story and to tie up the loose ends from last two parts.

No amount of words would be enough to praise Christopher Nolan for giving us a stellar finale.

My Rating: 9/10"
"I don't normally review movies unless I feel compelled to do so. In this case, I feel I was duped into expecting a very good movie. Isn't that what I should have expected with an 8.5/10 rating?

I won't get into the details, they're well-documented throughout these reviews. And I won't detail the nonsense that is considered a plot for those that may not have had the displeasure of viewing this movie. There are so many times that I was left shaking my head that I sustained a neck injury just watching this.

I like the idea of Bane as a physically powerful foe, I like Anne Hathaway as Catwoman (although her character has serious flaws) and the veterans do their normal commendable job attempting to bring stability to this disaster.

I gave it a 3 because I like Batman and I still want to like him. I will put this movie out of my mind so that I continue to like him."
"The plot is a total nonsense from the beginning to the end. They don't even try to make it believable. I know it's a super hero movie, we're not in the real world, but still. I felt this movie was an insult to the public. It's like saying you don't understand anything of what is happening in the world around you, why would you care to understand what is going on in the movie? We end up with a very childish plot where whatever you want to happen just happens with magic. A nuclear reactor turned into a nuclear bomb with a screwdriver in 2 minutes in a garage, a broken spine healed with a rope and 3 push ups, it's all like this. Just boring and lazy. Even the fights are lame. Bane and Batman are supposed to be the 2 best fighters in the world but they fight like a couple of drunk cowboys. Jackie Chan would kick their butt in no time. Can't believe it's rated 8.7 today."
"I wanted to write ""just see it,"" but IMDb requires 10 lines, so here goes nothing. There's something in this film for everyone, especially Batman fans. That doesn't mean Chris Nolan and team tried to please everyone -- if you've seen any of his films, you know he's got too much integrity and cinematic love for that. There's romance, real drama and feeling, in contrast to the first two movies. Action fans will dig it, wingnut tech-heads will dig it. There's even a hint of the supernatural in this movie. War movie fans will dig it. I think it's fair to say that most Chris Nolan fans will dig it too. I can't even fault the film for it's moment of garbled dialogue, because those moment just fuel my desire to see this movie again. Just see it."
"Nolan has created a Pulp Masterpiece. With Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, Nolan set out to get Batman back to his gritty roots. With Rises, Nolan slowly backs out of the grittiness and enters a pulpier realm. A Bondian realm that begins with a mid-air high-jacking. Has a villain that wears a mask 99% of the film. Batman and Catwoman fighting side by side only to be stopped by gunfire from henchmen so incompetent they can only hit their own comrades rather than hitting their intended targets. And of course a nuclear bomb countdown. Nolan clearly has a love for James Bond films (as he also showed with Inception). As a fellow Bond aficionado, I really appreciate this, and it only adds to my overall enjoyment of the film. Superhero movies generally follow a particular formula. I could predict the plot beats of most of the recent Marvel films (this is not a complaint of Marvel's Cinematic Universe, just an observation). The point is that this film (as its predecessor did) threw me more surprises than most films of this genre typically do. And my expectations were blown away. TDKR has a very intricate structure, and for being 165 minutes long, the movie flies by at a nice pace.

Nolan's film has the feeling of a Coppola-sized epic from the 1970s, with its plot complexity, large cast of characters, intricate dialogue scenes with equal helpings of pain and tragedy. Many scenes in the film are shot in an orange/sepia tone that reminds me of The Godfather Part II. Tom Hardy's Bane is a mythical, Kurtz-like antagonist. The film has subtext and some political satire, one can interpret that how they will.

""The Dark Knight Rises"" could very well be the most polarizing film of Nolan's career thus far, hopefully the debate will continue."
"Wow this brilliant way of ending the trilogy makes me feel that this is just the beginning. I would call the same casting on and on for more adventure.

Bane is not my favorite character by far (really not interesting, just a tough guy) but all participate intensely and have a role and feed the story. The casting is incredible: Batman Begins + Inception + Anne Hathaway (she's such a complete and lovable actress and person)

I just got the 2 DVD collector edition in Switzerland yesterday. I definitely recommend watching the bonus features, they explain a lot about the concept behind this movie and the connection with the beginning of the story.

An amazing production, screenplay, performance !

And yet: The whole experience was so different than on big screen. ""Duh"" you might say and still... let me explain myself:

I recognized that some parts are only effective if you watched the film only once. This doesn't necessarily happen with other masterpieces I can watch on an on.

When I watched all the interesting bonus features on the second DVD, I started noticing that from many multiple shots (shots filmed from many angles at the same time) the choice of those shots used for the movie weren't the clearest, or the most astonishing. So may things are finally not so clearly seen in the movie. There were many other successful angles that could have been used more effectively.

Music soundtrack ? Hans Zimmer did a nice job but I would have preferred James Newton Howard.

The fights weren't that clever, too tough and bulky, not necessary, no intelligence around them, plain fist. Not my port of call.

Thank you Christopher Nolan for being clever enough to participate in the cinema industry and still deliver ART.

Definitely a realistic, surprising and enjoyable film

Thanks to all reviews and commentaries.

A.real"
"THE BEST.

THE GREATEST.

THE ULTIMATE EXPERIENCE.

THE DEFINITION OF AN ENTIRE GENERATION.

Every once in a while, there's that one trilogy that would change the landscape of the film industry forever and would define an entire generation.

There was George Lucas' Star Wars trilogy, which took sci-fi movies to a whole new level (I wasn't born that time but I'm aware of the legacy of course).

Then decades later, it was Peter Jackson's Lord Of The Rings trilogy which raised the bar in fantasy epics so high that even now could never be reached much less equaled (yes, Harry Potter and Game Of Thrones are baby stuff compared to the grandeur LOTR).

And now, Christoper Nolan's The Dark Knight trilogy.

Before, comicbook / superhero movies were too campy, too light-hearted and in every bit sense of the word, unrealistic. Characters were over the top, stories were cliché and predictable, no risk factors and just dull and there's no ""holy **** did you see that?!"" stuff. It's as if they weren't serious efforts, like, studio guys would just say ""hey since everybody's doing it, let's do it!"". Results vary but mostly mediocre stuff and below. Simply, you don't get emotionally-attached to them, which is THE POINT of watching movies.

Enter the Nolan-era of comicbook / superhero movies.

Quite literally, Nolan turned the genre upside-down, flip it and then some. Nolan CHANGED THE GAME and took it to uncharted levels by introducing never before seen elements such as dark tones and themes, gripping plots and scripts, masterclass musical scores, relatable characters which comprises of genuine heroes and likable villains, above all, pulse-pounding moments that would make your jaw drop countless times and say ""HOLY ****! HOLY ****! HOLY ****!!!"". It's a genuine effort and love of the craft that you can see and feel as much as Lucas to Star Wars and Jackson to LOTR.

It started with Batman Begins almost 7 years ago in 2005, continued 3 years later with The Dark Knight and now finally capped off with the monumental conclusion The Dark Knight Rises in 2012 as the motion picture event of the year. The trilogy redefined Batman and Bruce Wayne and everything we know in Gotham City. Right off Batman Begins' origin story, to the emotional torture core of The Dark Knight and to pain, suffering and triumph of The Dark Knight Rises, the legend of The Caped Crusader was flawless and the acting of the cast was impeccable all throughout.

Of course, the guy that's got to be Batman has got to really be THE GUY, and Christian Bale not only meet expectations, he exceeded them in every step of the way.

Bale is the perfect Batman, just was the late great Christopher Reeve was as Superman. I mean, nobody could replicate that connection from Reeve and Superman for decades, maybe ever (though DC and Warner Bros. would try again with Henry Cavill in Man Of Steel, we'll see). Same thing can be said to Spider-Man's Tobey Maguire, that Facebook guy is awful compared to him. As well as Robert Downey Jr. in Iron Man. And I believe the case is the same for Bale; it's gonna be LONG, LONG TIME until somebody could match, much less surpass him as Batman. Most likely, never. In a nutshell, we felt for Batman because of Bale.

And same thing could be said with Nolan's Batrilogy. Right from the opening scenes of Begins and as the credits roll of TDKR, it was a ride like no other comicbook / superhero movie has done ever before. This is the kind of stuff we'd tell our children and grandchildren that defined our generation, that we'll make them watch these things years from now and tell them experiences waiting in line outside theaters and watching DVDs and Blu-rays at midnight, like our parents now do. I mean, I'm not even a comics guy (I don't read any paper stuff honestly), nor a Batman fan or fan of any comicbook or superhero, but when Nolan's trilogy came, I became one. That to me, is something EXTRAORDINARY very few in one's life could experience.

Obviously, Star Wars has it fair share of haters, so does LOTR, so why should we be surprised by the Nolan haters. These guys would scream ""oh that's boring I've seen that before!"" or ""that's predictable I knew it!"" or ""Avengers is the best STFU GTFO LOL LMAO!"" or whatever these guys could come up it. They're clueless anyway. Smart viewers know what's really up.

REMEMBER: These kind of critics are those who failed at art and literature and just about anything and everything in life. And when you're at the top, there'll always be those who'd want to pull you down. Nolan and his Batman is at top, that's why.

Huge props and thanks to Nolan and Bale, to Liam Neeson, to the late great Heath Ledger (I'd almost forget to say that his portrayal of The Joker is in the league of Darth Vader as the greatest villains ever), to Tom Hardy, to Michael Caine, to Gary Oldman, to Morgan Freeman and just about every actor and crew that participated in bringing Batman to life LIKE NO OTHER.

Take a bow ladies and gentlemen."
"Christopher Nolan's ambitious Batman trilogy has come to a close with perhaps one of the greatest superhero films ever made. Both Batman Begins and the Dark Knight were cinematic masterpieces and are complimented nicely with this film, The Dark Knight Rises. Being the longest film in the series, it has incredible set pieces, a sinister villain, excellent acting, a loud and bombastic score by Hans Zimmer, and lots of emotional depth.

Nolan's film takes place eight years after the events of the Dark Knight and Bruce Wayne has moved into seclusion. Regarding Gotham, crime has been suppressed with the Dent laws, but now a new force led by the notorious Bane is threatening to take control over Gotham. So is it time for Bruce to give his cowl and cape another shot?

This film has a plethora of characters so events may be confusing at time(which it wasn't for me.) Christian Bale as always is near perfect as Batman and he adds some emotional depth to his eccentricity. Michael Caine has a bigger role here and has some of the biggest, most emotion-filled dialogue of the film. While different in stature from the Joker, Tom Hardy makes a great Bane and reminds me greatly of Hannibal. Both Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman return and are amazing. I didn't think Anne Hathaway as Catwoman would be effective, but I was proved wrong. Joseph Gordon-Levitt brings his talent as well as a few surprises to the film.

Overall, this is an amazing ending to the greatest superhero trilogy. Some of the set pieces are just amazing and incredible to watch. The football stadium, the opening sequence with the airplanes, and the takeover of the stock exchange were just a few of my favorite sequences. But nothing competes with that amazing, action-packed finale. Some people may not like the ending at all, but I think it's a fair way to end the film. It's unfortunate that the movie shooting in Colorado overshadowed this film, but I want to point out movie violence is not the cause for real-life violence and we shouldn't abandon the theaters because of this heinous act. This film is amazing and I'm pretty sad that the trilogy is over. I rate this film 10/10."
"Excellent writing, excellent acting, excellent directing, etc. The Dark Knight Rises represents Christopher Nolan at his most epic cinematic state. TDKR is more ambitious than the previous two films and takes greater risks which ultimately pay off. although not quite as immersive as The Dark Knight, TDKR is more emotionally wrenching, provides more twists and operates on a much grander scale.

Despite the large new cast, Christopher Nolan manages to breathe life into each character, even the ones so ordinary as Joseph Gorden Levitt's typical cop. He also manages to tie all events in the move to a brilliant thematic climax that will wow just about everyone.

Overall, the movie is incredible and although it doesn't quite meet the standards set by The Dark Knight, it still manages to inspire immense awe from its audience."
"'The Dark Knight Rises' isn't Epic. But its impressive nonetheless. Christopher Nolan delivers a film worth watching, however, he doesn't quiet top himself in here. Its an entertainer!

'The Dark Knight Rises' Synopsis: Eight years on, a new terrorist leader, Bane, overwhelms Gotham's finest, and the Dark Knight resurfaces to protect a city that has branded him an enemy.

'The Dark Knight Rises' is overtly long & dragging. Christopher Nolan & Jonathan Nolan's Screenplay is excellent in parts, but at times, it comes across as dragging & long. For example, the bad-guy, Bane, played by Tom Hardy, why does he hate Gotham so much & why he's being so god-damn heartless. There is proper reason, yet he's creating a chaos. Another flaw, lies in its running time. 168 minutes seems a bit too stretched. Christopher Nolan's Direction is extremely competent. Cinematography is grand. Editing & Art Design, are spectacular. Action-Sequences are huge.

Performance-Wise: Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman, shines. The Oscar-Winning Actor is so believable & natural in his part. Tom Hardy as Bane, is a big letdown. Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle, is quite good. Michael Caine as Alfred, is given the backseat, while Gary Oldman as James Gordon & New-Entry Joseph Gordon-Levitt as John Blake, are terrific. Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate, has a delicious role. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, is dignified.

On the whole, 'The Dark Knight Rises' is an impressive superhero flick, but it isn't half as good as its predecessor 'The Dark Knight'."
"I am a person that just do not believe in a perfect rating, but this movie definitely deserves a full credit. I mean whats not perfect in it? the acting , the music, the story , the action, everything was made in the most perfect way ever and I Like it. I saw this movie may be 3 times now and I believe it is very difficult to do such great work again.

I will never forget the first time i saw it in the movies and the theater was full and at the end of it everyone started applauding like i never saw in my entire life. If for any reason you hadn't seen this movie then you should. You will just love it."
"The Dark Knight Rises Review 3/5

The expectations were high for this film given that it was a direct follow up to The Dark Knight. With a great storyline, memorable characters, groundbreaking action scenes and a perfect performance by Heath Ledger it was easily one of the best comic book adaptations to date. But even that film had its flaws but not as much as this one. At the time of its release a lot of the critics received backlash and even death threats from the rabid fans. The fans were even worse than the Star Wars fans. Anyway The Dark Knight Rises is far from perfect but it does have some enjoyable moments throughout.

Eight years have past since the events of The Dark Knight. Bruce Wayne is retired living his life in isolation, The Joker is locked away and Gotham City's crime rate is at an all time low. But the masked villainous Bane and his army are lurking in the sewers and he has a plan. After hearing about Commissioner Gordon being hospitalised and encountering a mysterious cat burglar Bruce Wayne decides to come back out of retirement. It's a real crowd pleaser when he comes back as Batman but he has to go toe to toe with his toughest opponent yet. He's not as fast as he used to be however that is what gives the film it's edge, we can finally root for Bruce Wayne because he is in a vulnerable state here. Bane is sort of like a 60s Bond villain taking the city hostage threatening to blow it up if anyone leaves.

The opening plane hijack sequence is breathtaking and like the majority of the action sequences it was shot in IMAX using practical effects. From miniatures to daring stunts we see real stuntmen hang off of the dangling plane fuselage. The overall action scenes are intense accompanied by an epic music score by returning composer Hans Zimmer. Although some of them suffer from bad editing they are still enjoyable and look spectacular. It's best to watch it with surround sound speakers as the sound effects make the experience more immersive from Banes heavy breathing, the bone crunching punch ups to the extremely loud gunshots and explosions. It's the most action packed of the trilogy but it suffers from a thin plot.

Christopher Nolan does a fine job directing the film but not much can be said about his screenplay. Unfortunately it's his worst writing yet making this the most implausible chapter. It's full of so many character storylines and it just gets confusing. There are a lot of things that make little to no sense. There isn't much logic to many of the scenes, there are some obvious twists throughout and a lot of things go by unexplained. Using flashbacks it harps back to previous plot lines and characters in an attempt to make it feel more connected to those films. On top of all that it runs at nearly 3 hours which is just too long considering how half baked the plot is.

Aside from all of this Christian Bale gives his best performance as a more weary broken Bruce Wayne. Tom Hardy is really good in the role of Bane and every time he's on screen he is physically imposing, very intimidating and he has some great lines of dialogue. Michael Caine is only in it briefly but he gives an emotional nuanced performance as family butler Alfred. Joseph Gordon Levitt and Anne Hathaway both do serviceable jobs - However with such a big cast the film didn't really need them, they are just there for fan service and to be honest their story arcs are not very interesting. But that being said Hathaways cat suit has a cool realistic look to it which fits well within the continuity of the Nolan franchise. That's one thing you can give them credit for is they make these films as grounded in reality as possible. But with outlandish characters like Bane and Catwoman there are a lot of things they have to compromise like Selina Kyle/Catwomans backstory. She wasn't resurrected by cats like the comics, she is simply just a woman who is very good at sneaking about. Bane isn't a raging hulk who gets pumped on steroid juice he's just a conflicted man who has been through some bad stuff. Overall it's a thourouly enjoyable film but it's let down by lazy writing full and plot-holes."
"This is one of my favorite bad movies ever. So many things in it don't make any sense. It's awfully written and the fact that this movie has an 8.4 shows that many people don't have a single braincell.

FBI guys in plane instead of shooting attackers outside plane decide to start punching their tied-down prisoners so the movie can happen.

Who are Bane's armed men in the first place and why do they blindly follow him?

Gotham sends the entirety of Gotham's cops (3,000 in a city of 12 million compared to New York's 40,000 cops in a city of 8 million) into the sewers instead of smaller teams of Swat troopers or national guard and now they're trapped? And can't they just climb out of the manholes or is Bane's men guarding every manhole in the city?

The cops charge Bane's men armed with machine guns and hardly any of the cops die and the next scene everyone is in a fist-fight?

Why doesn't Bane detonate the bomb immediately? Why wait 6 months? Literally no reason because he intends to just blow it up regardless.

Awful ending twist with Talia Al'Ghul that means nothing to anyone and leads to an unintentionally hilarious death scene.

Batman's broken back fixed by a rope and a punch to it.

All in all, not good."
"The Matrix, Spiderman and Pirates Of The Caribbean, all critically acclaimed and all bringing in a satisfying box office return. Their reputation inspiring movie bosses to produce sequel, which all ended up disappointing... Will The Epic 'Dark Knight' trilogy be reduced to the same fate... The world waited with baited breath.

The Dark Knight Rises, the third and final installment of Christopher Nolan's comic book saga lived up to it's name to rise above other movie trilogies and soar to the thematic and stylistic heights of its predecessors.

In the mid 1990s' the reputation of Warner Bros. Batman franchise was at an all time low with Batman & Robin producing some of the cheesiest one liners in cinema history (such as Mr Freezes ""Ice to see you!"").

In 2005 Nolan resurrected the Caped Crusader in with the critically praised 'Batman Begins'', the grittier and darker origin story of how Bruce Wayne became to be a moonlight masked vigilante standing up against injustice in the city of Gotham. Helped with solid performances from Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes and Cillian Murphy a sequel was inevitable.

In 2008, Nolan and his team returned for the follow-up. The Dark Knight, just as captivating and ingenious as the first but with one exceptional difference. Heath Ledgers Joker, stole the show (and Academy Award) as he bought Gotham City to it's knees by turning Gothams White Knight (DA Harvey Dent) on to a grief driven killing spree that destroys everything that Harvey and Batman had fought so hard to stop.

In The Dark Knight Rises, the story has progressed eight years. Batman has taken blame for Harvey Dents murders and left Gotham to fend for itself. Bruce Wayne is holed up in a rebuilt Wayne Manor and is the most adrift we've seen the character on screen, weakened and even going grey he is considering a return to action against taking a new path. Bruce and Alfred (Michael Caine) debate Batman's future in tense and tender exchanges, that will tug your heart. You're hooked, and the fighting hasn't even started.

In a scene James Bond would kill for, a CIA aircraft transporting terrorists is sensationally hijacked in midair by Bane (Tom Hardy), an intimidating hulk whose nose and mouth are encumbered by a tubular, grill-like metal mask which gives his voice an artificial quality similar to that of Darth Vader. What Bane is up to is not entirely clear, but it can't be good.

Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), A spirited Cat burglar tries to get Bruce Wayne/Batman back into the limelight. But an attempted kidnapping of Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) and a brazen attack on the Stock Exchange from Bane is what catches the Bats attention, the latter catastrophe having the double effect of bankrupting Bruce Wayne.

Commandeering the city's sewers with his fellow mercenaries, Bane begins his first onslaught on the caped crusader which will leave you gasping in disbelief. If the Theme behind Batman Begins was fear and the Dark Knight is chaos then the theme behind this movie is clear Pain! The remaining 90 minutes will keep you on the edge of your seat, the pinnacle moment when Bane destroys well everything, including a masterfully created scene that we've already seen in the trailers when Gotham's Football stadium implodes to the earthy. Depths below.

The real world threats of terrorism, political anarchy and economic instability make The Dark Knight Rises incomparable to this years other superhero blockbusters. While The Avengers may have bigger zings, The Dark Knight Rises has one thing Whedon missed: emotional engagement; a genuine sense of jeopardy and deepening human drama. (OK, three things.)"
"With this film I would say it was quite magical. The affects that took place were spectacular a great increase from The Dark Night. When I saw this film, as a Batman fan I purchased the trilogy ticket starting from the first Batman featuring Christian Bale up to the Dark Night rises.One thing I would have to add is that I feel as if Anne Hathaway didn't live up to the role of Catwoman as I expected also known as Selina. I thought that she could have used some studying from older movies or even comic books to display the attitude of Selina just a little bit more. But overall this was an exciting film and ultimately one of the best Batman movies to come in this day in age. Unfortunately I am not that ecstatic for Ben Afleck to play the new Batman coming out in theaters's in 2015."
"Not being a huge fan of superhero movies, I didn't have much expectations for Batman Begins. However viewing the 2005 Christopher Nolan production, I was pleasantly shocked. Then after my huge expectations for, ""The Dark Knight"", Christopher Nolan blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, ""The Dark Knight Rises""? Quite simply, Yes! My big expectations were once again, blown away. What a production! This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The editing, sound, score, visuals, direction and action are all top notch.

The film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Christian Bale, of course still makes is a great Batman. Michael Cain is fantastic, as he always is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be considered for an Oscar nomination. Tom Hardy as Bane is utterly terrifying, at times, and completely ominous. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman/Selina Kyle is a scene stealer. She is completely engrossing. Everyone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors are so well done, so well written, and so well directed. The Dark Knight Rises is is emotionally riveting and amazing to view.

At a running time of almost 3 hours, the film never becomes dull, which is pretty impressive. The movie's action sequences are spectacularly well created and very intense. The dialogue between the character's are intelligent and highly believable. The movie's soundtrack is terrific and really exemplify's many of the movie's scenes. Extremely well editing and sound use really develop many of the movie's action scenes, so it's not just explosions and visuals like in many other movies. Nolan creates a grand, dirty, engrossing world, and his action sequences just hum.

In conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that great writing and direction can enhance any movie-going experience, even superhero movies, which are usually thought of as mindless entertainment. I am wholly satisfied with Christopher Nolan's vision and thank all who worked on this film for bringing such an intricate interpretation of its very famous literary source. I cannot recommend this film anymore than I have, I just have to say everyone and anyone should see it. 10/10"""
"The Dark Knight trilogy tells us a lot about Nolans understanding of modern cinema, as well as his control over the Batman franchise.

It's not always obvious that Nolan is that interested in the hero genre, more with continuing the journey he started with Inception (along with much of the same cast). But the advantage of this is that the scenes with Batman and Bruce Wayne have no extra gravity to them, giving the chance for characters to develop.

To a degree.

Even approaching 3 hours, Nolan stretches his skill and that of the cast to rush through much of the plot, especially the back-stories that he isn't much interested in. This leads to the usual number of unexplained convergences, plot vacancies and narrative extended death scenes that plague most modern films. Yes, it drives the internet forums and people see the films again but this weakens cinema and strengthens the longer TV serials that attract so many film directors. Nolans exploration of identity (every character has a masked past, present or future) feels compressed here, fitted between the blowing up of the scenery.

Looking through his, er, oeuvre, it is clear that Nolans interest in perception was best met by Christopher Priest with The Prestige. I can see Nolan and Priest combining again, but I can't see him trying another full action film - his disdain for the material is starting to surface."
"This will be a very underrated movie due to the amazingness of The Dark Knight. However, in many ways it is just as groundbreaking, philosophical, profound, and good as its predecessor. It won't necessarily surpass the masterpiece that the Dark Knight is, but it really comes awfully close. It is its own thing, and other than a few sequences midway through and towards the end, it is every bit a masterpiece of action-filmmaking as The Dark Knight. The way Nolan handled the introduction, background, and development of the new characters was a treat and very satisfying. The only difference between this and the Dark Knight really is that the weaknesses of The Dark Knight Rises are just more pronounced. With a few scenes edited out in the middle, it would be just as good. This movie has inspirational components to it, while The Dark Knight has more morality-oriented components to it. But they both contain bits of both."
"The third and final installment in this trilogy is much maligned because of a horrible incident around its release that had nothing to do with the film. While that tragedy is hard to separate from the film, it is unfortunate because the film is very good. The film is as dark and painful to watch as the prior two, but just as good in my opinion. The events of the two prior come together and come full circle as Christian Bale's character has to deal with his past, the events he put in place, and his place in the world. Tom Hardy is excellent as Bane. The supporting cast is terrific. This, like the prior, is an adult film. It is gritty and visceral. The action is chaotic at point but very engaging. I like this story arc. I like these characters. I think the Direction and the visuals are unmatched. While I loved Tim Burton's Batman and respect it immensely nothing compares to this trilogy. It is not just good superhero filmmaking. It is great filmmaking using the superhero story as a vehicle to explore universal themes. See this and see it again."
"What a film! Rarely does one call a superhero flick a cinematic work of art. Well this one certainly is that and much more. It isn't a run-of-the-mill popcorn, action packed, story-less offering that many superhero films are. This one goes above and beyond. It is less about the masked man and more about the man behind the mask, a broken man fighting his own demons. A dark and emotional tale of absolution and revenge, strength and sacrifice. Anne Hathaway is brilliant as Catwoman. Its no wonder she is receiving nominations for her role in this movie and in Les Miserables. Bane i think is the highlight of this movie. His speech may go down in dialogue history. You feel mesmerized and taken aback by the sheer force of this movie. It has everything from the deepest darkest emotions to powerful confrontation scenes and a breathtaking climax. I had no idea so much time had gone by, that is how gripping this film is. Though if you prefer more violence and action, then this may not be for you. Personal opinion: It is the best film of 2012. A must see as it raises the bar for not only superhero flicks but also films in general."
"I love the whole Batman series with Christian Bale. I love the fact his voice was not nearly as annoying in this film. I did not see that twist at the end coming which was a nice surprise. The only thing I didn't like was Bane's character. I think it was just because of the mask thing and not really being able to see him. The actor did a great job portraying the character despite this. This is one of those movies you can watch multiple times and pick up different clues along the way. I do wish Morgan Freeman had a bigger role in this one. Love Lucius! I would like a TV movie of Lucius and Alred having some adventures together. After seeing this one, I think it's time for a Batman marathon."
"The third and final instalment of Christopher Nolan's, Jonathon Nolan's and David S. Goyer's legendary trilogy is my least favourite, but is by no means bad. The problem I have found with 'The Dark Knight Rises' is its loss of realism. 'Batman Begins', the first instalment, was extremely realistic and somehow still faithful to the comics. That was what made the film so amazing, in my opinion. 'The Dark Knight' loses the realism and the faithfulness to a degree, but that wasn't a bad thing. The tension, story, ideas and genuinely scary villains of the second instalment made it not just better than the first instalment, but possibly better than any other superhero film ever made.

The conclusion to this nigh perfect trilogy doesn't come close to the first two, but still satisfies. The realism, possibly the best thing about this trilogy, is gone. There is more than one scene or concept where you may think ""Well that's just plain stupid!"" On realism, it could have been much better. You'll know what scenes and concepts I am speaking of when you see them. Is this film faithful to the comics? No, it's even less faithful than 'The Dark Knight', but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. It means even fans of the comics are in for big, Nolan twists. I believe that it is faithful enough for most fans to enjoy it, but much less faithful than the two previous films.

The writing of this film is much like the last two. It's very Nolan; intelligent but somewhat confusing. I think the problem with this instalment is that the writers tried too hard to make it the biggest and the best. This is part of the reason the film fails to live up to the previous two. The writing is certainly the worst of the three films, but is definitely not bad writing. It still seems dark and mysterious. I think they relied too much on shocks and scary villain scenes than on adding tension and genuinely terrifying, slow scenes. The Joker had many of these scenes in the previous film, seeming unpredictable and adding tension. Due to no more Joker, the humour is gone. This was necessary, but takes away some enjoyment for me.

The directing of this film is much like the previous two. Nolan uses the same style throughout all three instalments. The directing again takes away realism with the action not being realistic. I believe that if the age certificate was bumped up they could have made the film much more terrifying and realistic. The action in the film goes back to relying on fighting usually like in 'Batman Begins', not tension like 'The Dark Knight'. However, there are still tense scenes with Bane (Tom Hardy) that match some of the previous film's Joker scenes. The shots and action scenes are fantastically done, like the previous two, but as I have said, Tim Burton's Gothic look is more preferable to me.

The characters in this are amazing. Hardly any of them seem like their comic book selves, but this can be great, adding a fresh, unique feeling to the film. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is brilliant as Blake, who I do believe adds to the film, unlike others. I also loved the controversial twist with Blake. If it were done any other way it'd probably take away the darker side to the film. The way it was done was very unique and interesting. I loved Cillian Murphy's cameo as Scarecrow again. I always love some Cillian Murphy in a film, and his rather insane Scarecrow adds a lot, in my opinion.

Christian Bale plays a brilliant Batman/Bruce Wayne yet again. I love the dark edge to his character rough voice he uses as Batman. Tom Hardy was terrifying as Bane. He is the opposite of the Joker, thinking out a large scale plan and being calmly menacing. Very different to the comic book Bane in lots of ways, but I do enjoy different takes on characters, instead of the same thing in each remake. Anne Hathaway played an interesting Selina Kyle. She doesn't seem to be into the alter ego thing.. I don't think anyone calls her Catwoman throughout the entire film. Her settling down with Bruce Wayne doesn't appeal to me, as it isn't in character enough.

James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer did an excellent job with the music yet again. All of the tracks are unique and are great additions. The soundtrack is very different to the previous films. The first two instalments use dragged out, slow music to create tension most of the time. This film does that, but to a much lesser degree. What I loved about the series' music in the first two was the tense, slow, metallic music that suits Batman and isn't like the usual exciting, blasting music. This music, while unique, is exciting and blasting usually. It takes the tension away again, which is one of the best things about this trilogy. As a standalone soundtrack, I absolutely love this, but as a part of this trilogy I'm not too fund of it. I much prefer the tense, slow tracks.

Overall, I believe that this is a brilliant last instalment of a genius trilogy. I loved most of it. It is very different from the previous two, which is both good and bad. It felt very exciting and tense at times, and the overall story is excellent, if unrealistic. It is an amazing film, but is not close to as good as the previous two. I find it surprising that this ranks higher than Batman Begins on the Top 250 films. This finale doesn't disappoint. It is a genius conclusion for a genius trilogy. It's not as good as the other two instalments, but beating them would be an absolutely huge achievement. I expected a brilliant film to conclude the series, and that's what I got. Couldn't be happier."
"The best installment of the Batman trilogy, The Dark Knight Rises is involving, gripping, and riveting. The story is on par, as well as a great cast new to the series (Tom Hardy, Anne Hathaway, Marion Cotillard, etc.). The movie never lags, and Tom Hardy's Bane comes across as a testosterone-fueled hunk of a man who knows true pain and wants to do justice in his own twisted ways.

While some may say that the background story of Bane isn't what's in the comics, just stop. Did it fit the movie? Maybe it didn't, because I bet my ass director Christopher Nolan took that into consideration. I bet they did a screen test, and that storyline didn't work. To be honest, it's not that big of a detail and can be easily overlooked, and it didn't do any damage to the story. In fact, it made it *that* much more interesting.

HandHStudios Rating: 10/10"
"Only Christopher Nolan, maybe alongside with the uniqueness of James Cameron and Peter Jackson's ""LOTR"" .. was able to push his own limits to deliver a better film every time .. I mean ..Batman Begins was a staggering reboot for the Batman Franchise.. The Dark Knight was simply a masterpiece ..in between there was Inception.. an incredible cinematic vision.. ! But this , The Dark Knight Rises.. is ABSOLUTE GENIUS ! Easily a once in a lifetime experience if u watch that in IMAX I mean ,people.. a 2:45 minutes movie that would keep you glued to your seat the entire time without a moment of boredom ..the entire time blown away..the entire time thinking what's gonna happen next..and hits the climax with a genius ending .. i don't know ,but ..this one has Oscars written all over it..and Nolan deserves it after such an incredible effort on his timeless trilogy and a movie that will be remembered for decades to come ! Performances..Tom Hardy,awesome job "" but still ,Joker is untouchable""..Chris Bale, amazing.. Anne Hathaway , definitely a highlight in this movie..OMG! Visuals.. i can't even start! Editing.. genius ! Score.. Heart pounding with every frame,gripping ! Directing.. mind blowing ! You expected to be blown away by this movie ? well .. i'm sure you will be , and beyond ! Best movie of the year ,hands down..and maybe for years to come ! There could easily be a fourth and a fifth installment..but who knows ,uptil now this trilogy is by far absolute perfection among all movie genres,if i may say ! Bravo Nolan and chapeau,for you are such an artist to look up to. And as for Batman.. well .. you'll always be my favorite superhero. Cheers everyone ."
"Nolan has got us accustomed to a very high standard of film making, no matter what he tackles as the subject. The Dark Knight trilogy is a very good example of this, when your typical superhero films can also stand as powerful pieces of cinema. Alas ""Dark Knight Rises"", after the exploding success of the brilliantly captured ""Dark Knight"", did fell short in comparison. Arguably, the success of any Batman film and even comic/graphic novel is dynamics between our dark hero and the villain, and in my opinion, Batman vs Bane was not taken to it's full potential. The tactical brilliance of Bane, portrayed by Hardy, was always out-shadowed by his brutality and sheer raw power, with a very dubious choice of voice effects that subtracted the terrifying factor right out of the equation, while Bale's performance was never stellar throughout the trilogy, this script did nothing to develop his character, mostly the opposite happened when you reach the end of this story. The big revelation concerning our villain only made the whole concept of Bane even less powerful, shedding some light into some questionable plot holes in the story, and there is an unwelcome sort of cheesy in all Joseph Gordon-Levitt scenes, unquestionably brought to light in the last minutes of the film. All in all, the film does feel like an ending, further deconstructing the myth of Batman, a vigilante created by a common crime by a faceless criminal, to fight so that someone wouldn't suffer through the same."
"There are not enough words to describe the magnitude of this film, let alone space to even attempt it. So I'll do my best with what I have.

This film is perfect in every way. The synergy of elements, both technical, dramatic, and those supplied by the audience (such as emotional investment in the series, etc.) make it perfect. Writer/Director Chris Nolan understood how invested the audiences were in this series and he hit every single note perfectly.

The picture unfolds like a beautiful nightmare. We ease back into the world of Gotham well enough that we recognize the world we left briefly from the Dark Knight. Instantly we feel that the stakes are higher, and as the film goes on, the stakes are raised even further, seemingly impossibly so. Then, finally, as the picture hits its stride, we find ourselves engrossed in a spectacle the likes of which have not been approached since Lord of the Rings.

The depth of story and character, like so many of Nolan's films, are what bring all the elements to a head. Bane is maniacle, calculating, determined, and above all, undeniably and irrevocably brutally violent. This violence takes all forms, and manifests itself into some of the most brilliantly awe-inspiring action sequences you will EVER see.

Dark Knight Rises gets better with every passing second, between the action, the intrigue, the drama, and the mystery, the final result is nothing short of stunning. And while this may be an opinionated review, I beg every person alive to experience what this film has to offer.

I swear on my life this movie is pure perfection."
"Christopher Nolan has finished up the Batman series in remarkable style. Where Batman Begins was about conquering fears and the Dark Knight was about traversing the fine line between order and madness; the Dark Knight Rises seems to be a movie about compromise and acceptance.

It has been eight years since the death of Harvey Dent and Gotham has settled down into some semblance of peace. The main instigators of this crime-free age, however, have many scars for their trouble. Bruce Wayne ( Christian Bale ) is a reclusive cripple- with shot knees and scar tissue riddling his body. Commissioner Gordon ( Gary Oldman ) has found his career is now burdened by the lie that he and Batman wove to keep Harvey Dent's reputation spotless- so much so that he is separated from his family. Alfred ( Michael Caine ) despairs about Bruce Wayne's welfare- fearing that his master wants little more than a grand death. And Lucius Fox ( Morgan Freeman ) is attempting to stave Wayne Enterprises from bankruptcy thanks to all the money that Wayne has invested into Miranda Tate's ( newcomer Marion Cotillard ) renewable energy source.

However a new threat emerges in the guise of Bane ( Tom Hardy )- a massive masked mercenary who has a connection to Batman's past. He claims to want a new Gotham where the 'have-nots' can rule over the 'haves' and bring true justice to the rich and corrupt. Alongside him is Selina Kyle ( Anne Hathaway ) a cat burglar who motives are enigmatic at best. It is therefore up to the old guard as well as idealistic cop John Blake ( Joseph Gordon-Levitt ) to try and hold Gotham together.

Nolan has gone for bigger is better in his third movie of the trilogy and it certainly comes off as an sweeping, epic movie. Christian Bale probably gives his best performance as Bruce Wayne and Batman and the scenes he has with Caine's Alfred are particularly moving. Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman are both very good also- with the scenes between Oldman and Gordon-Levitt ( probably the best of the newcomers ) nice to watch.

But as good as the film is...it doesn't really seem to cover much more new ground. This isn't really helped by their choice of villain. Hardy does a good job as Bane, but he isn't helped by his breathing mask which makes him, at times, hard to understand. Furthermore, while Bane is shown to be dangerous, Nolan seems to be forcing the viewer to show how dangerous he is. Without the personal and affable menace of Neeson's Ra's Al Ghul or the twisted and frightening charisma of Ledger's Joker, Bane's most menacing moments come before the real action kicks off. Furthermore, it's difficult to see why anyone would want to follow him- utopia or not.

As for Catwoman, Hathaway is very good in the role, but her character seems to be frustrating at times- seeming to just sit on the fence for the heck of it. Cotilliard's Miranda Tate is a fairly bland character that doesn't add much to the proceedings either.

Furthermore, while the movie is indeed epic in scope, it sometimes gets lost in its own arcs in a way that the Dark Knight never did. The twists and turns that would have been seen as remarkable in the Dark Knight in this movie came across as almost unnecessary.

Begins was a tight film that revolved around a single plot arc and holds together well. The Dark Knight was the true noir epic- a sweeping tale about morality and order in a insane city. The Dark Knight Rises is a flawed masterpiece- it's achievements not quite living up to the ambitions that it perhaps had. However, any Batman movie directed by Christopher Nolan is probably a good one. This is no exception."
"Nolan nailed it on the head with this one. Banes awesome voice and tyrant role makes this movie flat out the most epic of the trilogy. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, and as mentioned in previously read reviews, Bane on screen really gets your blood pumping. The late Joker had a great plan for corruption, but Bane's plan is simply to rule - and he plays the part perfect. There will certainly be comparisons of the two, but their characters are so entirely different, there is no comparison. Nolan also nails it again with these surprise character roles in Hathaway and Hardy - Bane is by far the most epic villain the Bat has ever seen and Hathaway is surprisingly a sexy and bad ass Catwoman. I am just so bummed this series is over, and very bummed that Nolan's next work is Superman...

Hopeful Robin spin off anyone????"
"Will this add to TDK's legend? Sure, TDK was good but grew to be THE most overrated film of any genre because of the Ledger and Nolan fanboy InterLove. Now, TDKR delivers one of the most unmemorable and downright disappointing sequels ever put to film. Yes, it ranks right down there with Crystal Skull in terms of huge and head scratching let downs.

TDK was fine entertainment that may have gotten over-inflated and over-praised with the passage of time. Don't get me started about Batman Begins. The fact is that TDKR is another Batman Begins without the intrigue. Frankly, that makes Nolan's Batman trilogy a dull sandwich when you think about it. TDK is the meat and the first and now especially the third films are nothing but gummy Wonder Bread equivalents. I can't believe how shallow TDKR turned out despite them trying to jam everything in to the film. Unlike TDK, word of mouth will hurt TDKR because this mangled and often dumb film is a mess. A genuinely un-fun mess at that.

I know certain Nolan fanboys everywhere are circling the wagons to praise this movie but that in and of itself proves what I'm saying. Fanboys wanted to like it and apparently will look past all of its flaws. Everyone else is saying it's written like a shallow popcorn flick but with dull action sequences. There really is nothing special on display here and it's so much LESS than the second effort. How can a film follow something somewhat good with something this bad? It's not just the high expectations. It really is a bad film all on its own.

Yet, thanks to good trailers and a general fondness for TDK, this thing will take in big money early but leave a majority of the audience disappointed to say the least. If the viewer has at least half a brain, it's guaranteed that the actual movie is going to lead to general disappointment especially if you're not already a fan.

Overcrowded and cheesy fluff usually fizzles at the box office but TDKR is bulletproof at this point. The real judge of this movie will be general reaction and most are going to correctly label it a disappointment of epic proportions."
"I did not like how this was the most sentimental of the three Nolan Batman-movies. I prefer when the emotional aspects are more subtle, letting the audience draw its own conclusions about the characters feeling given their circumstances and back-stories. In The Dark Knight I felt the director trusted his audience more to understand Wayne's reactions after having heavily emphasized his childhood in Batman Begins. Whereas in The Dark Knight Rises it was much dwelled upon and fed to us with sentimental music. This made the first part of the movie a bit dreary, but it quickly became more enthralling and kept getting better as the story progressed. The acting was impeccable as were the visuals. I admit to having prejudices against superhero-movies, but the characters are complex and interesting. So was the plot, though it is clearly made to appeal to a mass-audience. There is nothing wrong with being popular and I did not waste my time watching these three movies."
"The Dark Knight Rises ends the Christopher Nolan trilogy based on the DC Comic superhero. Set eight years after the end of The Dark Knight, Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, Michael Cane, and Gary Oldman are back to fight the crime in Gotham City. This time, though, Batman faces one of his toughest opponents yet: Bane(played by Tom Hardy). Joining him are the unpredictable Catwoman(Anne Hathaway), and the young but passionate policeman John Blake( Joseph Gordan-Levitt).

As expected, Christian Bale gives an excellent portrayal of Batman, although this time he is allowed more time to build on Bruce Wayne. Morgan Freeman and Michael Cane bring their best once again, as they seem to always do in their films. Personally, I was a little weary of Anne Hathaway's performance of Catwoman. I've seen many of her films and generally enjoy her work. However, I was unsure if she could pull off Catwoman/Selina Kyle. Well, I was wrong. Hathaway was spectacular and shined in every moment on screen. I could say the same thing about Joseph Gordan-Levitt's performance, too. Sometimes the greatest asset to an actor is his or her ability to control every facial expression. Gordan-Levitt has perfected it, and proved it in his performance in TDKR.

There are only two negative notes to make about this film, as great as it is: the first being that it felt long. Yes, the film is nearly three hours long. And despite the fact that boredom never set in, I still felt the effects of a three-hour movie. At the same time, I didn't mind because there were several new characters who needed introducing and building, so it worked out for the better than the worst. The second, Bane's voice was a bit too raspy for my taste. There were a few moments where I had a difficult time understanding what he was saying. If they would have cleared his voice up just a wee bit more, it would have been perfect.

Overall, the film was fantastic, and was definitely what I was expecting, especially coming from a beautiful cast and superb director. Also, I can't help but mention the perfection that comes from Hans Zimmer. His film scores are sometimes the only reason I'll watch a movie(although not in this case lol)! The Dark Knight Rises was the best ending to this excellent trilogy. Now I'm looking forward to the next big project of Christopher Nolan!"
"The Dark Knight Rises fails to capture the magic of its predecessors. While it was understandable to suspend disbelief for the Joker's antic because of his volatility, the same doesn't hold true for a cold and calculated Bane. This time the nihilistic philosophical lessons come off as pretentious and worn out. Even the repeated formula of action sequences pale in comparison to the first two films. What's left is a hastily done wrap-up of a film with zero character development for the supporting cast and a shallow narrative painted over a faux black."
"I'm writing this for one purpose and one purpose only. I know it's fashionable to hammer Anne Hathaway for her portrayal. But what do people expect from her exactly? Do they want her to puRRR constantly? Do they really expect her to camp it up? That would run contrary to Christopher Nolan's vision. No, she played it to the level of Nolan's vision. She's not camping it up. She's not playing it big. She injects fragility into the character that is very much in keeping with this iteration of Batman. She injects much needed humanity into this character.

As for the movie, I have the same problem as the other 2. Too much explaining. That's why Heath Ledger's Joker is still the best. He did things just because he's crazy. No more explanation needed."
"The story , screenplay were really good. Worth watching. Non stop Action. If you compare it with the MARVEL - ""The Avengers"", then the ""The Dark Knight Rises"" would be a tough competition to beat. I personally wish that the series just goes on.

The film featured excellent performances, by all the cast. Christian Bale, as always is great as Batman. Anne Hathaway was completely engrossing, she became ""Catwoman"", just like Michele Pfeiffer did, although their interpretations were very different, both were equally effective. Tom Hardy was the main villain ""Bane"" completely shattered my expectations.

On the whole""The Dark Knight Rises"" certainly rises a fire for money in the Box Office."
"The Dark Knight has risen! The storm came, roared thunderously and blew everything away! Watching the film evokes the same kind of ecstasy as that of making love. It starts with an extended foreplay, builds up slowly, escalates wildly and culminates into an explosive, intense and unrelenting orgasm. In fact, it's a thousand times better than an orgasm. It's as close as having that romanticized elevated sense of being numb close on the heels of death. When you go numb and your senses fail you, and you are transported into a world that is beautiful, heart-wrenching, dark, compelling, unreal and majestic - you know that the storm has hit you, the fire that rose has engulfed you.

The best part of Nolan's Batman trilogy is that all the 3 films are distinctly different from each other. It would be unfair to compare The Dark Knight Rises with the previous two installments. Batman Begins was a Renaissance-moment, a triumphant interpretation of the caped crusader. His damaged psyche torn apart by guilt and fear - Nolan nails it with precision. And, the original treatment was so refreshing when Rachel points out that Bruce Wayne was the mask that Batman wore, not the other way round. The Dark Knight was edgier, darker, representing a world where chaos and order co-exist and complete each other; the sadistic sinisternerness of the Joker, blurring the boundaries between being amoral and being diabolical, is evidently portrayed - ""What am I without you? To them, you are just a freak, like me. You complete me."" It dealt more with the psychological, a duel between the Agent of Chaos and the Fallen Knight, whereas The Dark Knight Rises is much more physical. Nolan wanted it to be a spectacle, an extravagant and dazzling finale on epic proportions, and he did achieve it. It's no-holds-barred, outrageous and heart-pounding, gut-wrenching, raw action on one hand and on the other, it captures Batman's emotional vulnerabilities like never before. For the self-appointed critics - please stop comparing. Applaud and acknowledge the genius of Christoper Nolan."
"This review is from one of the biggest Batman fans in the world so I have my own special connection with this film and what it all represents but this doesn't mean that people who are not a particular Batman fan will not like this film (even people who love the Avengers will love this film... Probably more.)

Now, the actors & actresses in this film: -Christian Bale (Just wow) -Michael Caine (you may shed a tear in your eyes because of his performance) -Morgan Freeman (Always amazing.) -Tom Hardy (who was brutal as hell. Just fantastic) -Anne Hathaway (who destroyed Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman) -Marion Cotillard (Really, really good) -Gary Oldman (has officially made another iconic character in his long and amazing career)

So, it's safe to say that all the actors & actresses in this film are beyond fantastic.

This film is the best conclusion in the trilogy I have ever seen. The action scenes are fantastically directed and beautifully executed and the writing is beyond fantastic.

Christopher Nolan really smashed it and it is one of his best films he has ever made in his impeccable track record.

This is one of the best films of the year (not because I am a huge batman fan) but because it has a fantastic storyline and amazing action scenes.

I just love this film and yes. It is joint first with the best superhero films of all time and is just one of the best action films of all time."
"Christopher Nolan has delivered a jaw dropping assault on the senses. From the incredibly choreographed fight scenes to the nuanced subtle moments that should have won an Oscar.

From moment one, right at the very beginning of Batman Begins; Nolan has told a story that is very relatable. He made Batman a story that was believable. A story that if you saw it in the newspaper, you'd almost believe it.

This film delivers the best comic book adaption I've ever seen. The ability to draw from the source material, and make it your own whilst simultaneously staying true to the material is a token to how good a story teller this director is.

Not only did the team behind these movies deliver jaw dropping moments, one after the other, but they also helped to build the foundations of the superhero world we know and love today.

If I could give this film a 11 star rating I would. It lives up to be one of the best films I've ever seen."
"""The Dark Knight Rises"" It's not so much a story about The Batman, as much as a story about Gotham City and the people affected by Bruce Wayne's alter ego. It's a culmination of every action taken by The Batman coming down in the form of some menacing villains. It's the most anticipated movie of 2012 and because the bar has been raised so ridiculously high, it doesn't quite live up to the expectations. That doesn't mean that is a bad movie. DKR has excellent performances, a tense story that will keep you on the edge of your seat, cool additions to the Batman mythology and a compelling villain. The climax is one intense experience and what Tom Hardy does with just his eyes and his voice is unbelievable. He is a truly frightening foe for The Batman. Some of the criticisms I have concern the pacing of the film. I felt like at times it runs slightly too long and some of the slow beginning should have been cut a bit. Once the momentum gets going you won't want to miss a single second. It's a satisfying conclusion to the Christopher Nolan trilogy and aside from a few minor things it's pretty much the perfect third film in one of the best trilogies out there. (Theatrical version in Imax, August 29, 2012)"
"a splendid film. for the performance of each actor - Tom Hardy does an admirable work - , for Chistopher Nolan precision of each level of film, for sound and choreography and for its strange end. because it is not exactly last part of a series but top of a lot of expectations. and this fact makes difference. because it is a form of art who represents more than story of a super hero or one of high performances of Christian Bale but a magnificent puzzle , result of refined - wise science of well- crafted. the big problem can be the end, ideal for many other films, not inspired in this case. but the end is only a window. or a state of wind after tension, action and brilliant show. a trilogy who must see it ! not because it remains the best adaptation of Batman story but because it has deep roots and inspired answers for many of viewers."
"The problems with this mess of a movie are endless. Mainly, it's just boring and completely unbelievable...and way too long. There's not nearly enough Batman and, when he is on screen, he mostly gets his ass kicked. Meanwhile the villains are capable of doing everything successfully. As a result, Batman just comes off as tired and lame. The movie's war scenes smack more of Iron Man than Dark Knight. The movie desperately tries to prove how bad-ass Bane is, but he's just...not. Truly, I expected a scene with Bane loading cancer surviving, crippled grandmas into a bus and blowing them up. It was that silly. All the subplots slow things down: I could care less about the backstory of the chick with the accent, Robin (gee, I didn't see that coming two hours before it happened), the corporate stuff, Alfred's blubbering. Dull, dull, dull. Lastly, the sound is amateur. Everything is pushed up front, so it's often difficult to understand dialogue. Just a disorganized mess."
"SOMETIMES TRUTH IS NOT ENOUGH AND PEOPLE MUST BE REWARDED FOR THEIR FAITH'

It's an action-packed, mind blowing trailer that inspires a viewer to cinematic elevation which causes people to feel motivated to do good and increases their altruism.

Whereas, 'Batman: The Dark Knight' plays out ""with the help of allies Lt. Jim Gordon and DA Harvey Dent, Batman has been able to keep a tight lid on crime in Gotham City. But when a vile young criminal calling himself the Joker suddenly throws the town into chaos, the caped Crusader begins to tread a fine line between heroism and vigilantism"" (ref. Google).

While there were a ton of character strengths and virtues exhibited in this film of the following: wisdom, knowledge, creativity, judgement, love of learning, perspective, courage,bravery, perseverance, honesty, zest, humanity, love, kindness, social intelligence, justice, teamwork, fairness, leadership, temperance, forgiveness, humanity, prudence, self-regulation, transcendence, appreciation of beauty & excellence, hope, gratitude, and spirituality.

Now pertaining to the art of watching film; THE THEMATIC ELEMENTS were mild that showcased violence, crime, and corruption for a PG-13-rated drama.

As it was a FICTIONAL story with DRAMATIC ELEMENTS of crime that had villains who were inspired by infamous, criminals of real life.

The VISUAL DESIGN was imaginative. The CINEMATOGRAPHY was very engaging, allowing the audience to feel and seem like they were apart of the action. The SPECIAL VISUAL EFFECTS were powerful. The EDITING was smooth and exciting at times. The COLOR was rich and in full-resolution.

The SOUND EFFECTS were creative. The MUSICAL SCORE was memorable and compelling. The DIALOGUE was strong and expressive.

Now the ACTING showed glimpses of performances that were full of conviction and confidence, as the actors believe in what they're doing. Gary Oldman as Lt. Jim Gordon, Aaron Eckhart as DA Harvey Dent, Christian Bale as Batman, and Heath Ledger as the Joker were all brilliant. These actors stayed truthful in the moment and emotionally connected, as they fully transformed into their characters; to stay true to the original comic book characters.

Nevertheless, the DIRECTOR'S STYLE of Christopher Nolan was clear and full of vision as a confrontationalist; in this style of directing, the director is in constant dialogue and debate with the cast and the production team about creative decisions and interpretations. The director seeks out and actively engages in such exchanges. Out of these exchanges, which can sometimes be risky, comes a final contested product as we can see through the select choices of shots.

Overall the 'Batman: the Dark Knight' movie was phenomenal, but one thing I didn't agree with was the portrayal of schizophrenia paranoid-type in the joker; Hollywood seemed to have beefed it up. Yet you got to love Batman's heart for people as he loved unconditionally, giving them (even his enemies) a choice, and always seemed to make the right decisions; to reward people for their faith."
"Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends the realm of superhero film to become a profound exploration of human nature and the complexities of heroism. This epic conclusion to Nolan's Batman trilogy is a tour de force of filmmaking, boasting a narrative depth, visual splendor, and emotional resonance that is truly unparalleled.

The film masterfully weaves together themes of rebirth, redemption, and the fragility of hope, creating a tapestry of human experience that is both intimate and universal. Christian Bale delivers a tour-de-force performance as a Batman grappling both physical and psychological demons, while Anne Hathaway's Catwoman is a captivating and complex anti-heroine. Tom Hardy's Bane is a chillingly formidable antagonist, a force of nature that Batman and Gotham to their limits.

Nolan's meticulous attention to detail is evident in every frame, from the breathtaking cinematography to the haunting Hans Zimmer score. The action sequences are visceral and exhilarating, while the quieter moments are imbued with a raw emotional power. The Dark Knight Rises is more than just a blockbuster; it is a cinematic experience that lingers in the mind long credits roll.

It is a film that demands to be seen, and re-seen, to fully appreciate its brilliance."
"Nolan continues with the last chapter of the trilogy dedicated to the Dark Knight and closes the circle of the story. As always, he appears to be an introverted character full of internal conflicts who will find himself having to clash with everything and everyone to deal with the new threat, ""Bane"". As always, the plot is full of interesting ideas and is confirmed to be of the highest level although perhaps not reaching the peaks of the two previous stories, and hence my 9. It certainly brings to completion a saga that will remain immortal and will probably no longer be affected by any another suitor. For all those who love the genre, absolutely unmissable and ""obligatory"" for those who have viewed the two previous chapters."
"WOW, JUST WOW! Nolan has created posible one of the best trilogys of all time.

Look if im being honest this was the batman movie I was less excited to watch, it could never top the dark knigth, and the addition of catwomen just seem like a lacy addition to add something new. But oh was I thankfully wrong.

This movie explored new caracters such as bane and catwomen and they were perfectly introduce.

One of the things I most liked was how it was connected to the series roots, it had many connections with the first movie which was something I liked.

I also really like how depressing it is for batman, this movie takes the suffering more emotionaly which really made me feel bad for batman.

The villan was extrenly decent, it wasent the joker yet it was still good. The performances were nice.

9.5 out of 10 truly one of the best superheroe movie."
"What an end to the Batman trilogy. It's rare for sequels nowadays to be as good as the original but their are exceptions and the Batman trilogy was was one of em.

A solid story with great pacing and a plot that made sense and was engaging from the beginning till the end. The music composition and visuals were fantastic the best out of the trilogy. Bane's character was just awesome, Tom Hardy really did an amazing job. Lastly a brilliant job on the writing.

Overall an enjoyable movie that had a remarkable yet emotional ending Memorable: Yes. Rewatchable: Yes"
"A disappointing movie, Ben's character, despite the wonderful performance from Tom Hardy, that he was a character that was not up to par and the characters in the film made many stupid decisions"
"As time goes by and the hype dies down and the Nolanites either grow up or move on to other agendas, this film will be seen for what it really is; a bloated, stupid, preposterous and dull entry in the cinematic adventures of The Batman. If you are looking for Batman, you will be disappointed as he is scarcely in the film. The first half is particularly dull and could have easily been edited down drastically to ease some of the pain. The pacing picks up in the second half, but unfortunately, so does the absurdity in the plot. The motivation of the villains is never explained in anywhere close to a satisfactory manner and their actions defy all logic. The ending is particularly laughable and even embarrassing to watch. Nolan fans who claim that these Batman films are somehow rooted in the real world aren't really paying attention. This film is every bit as bad as the Schumaker films, worse because this takes itself seriously. THE DARK KNIGHT probably stands as the best Batman film to date despite it's own flaws. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is the worst. I'd rather watch Adam West as Batman than this mess."
Nothing more needs to be said. The trilogy just builds up to this amazing end. I had a small hope that maybe just maybe it would be a continuation with Bale and Nolan doing another one. That hope was destroyed when Affleck got the role..
"As everything this amazing human-being produced, this is an incredible movie. His batman trilogy is truly for everyone, fantasy/sci fi fans or not. You are gonna love this. Thanks Nolan and Christian Bale. to Freeman and Caine aswell."
"In a world inundated with superhero sagas, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" emerges as a triumph of complexity and depth. Director Christopher Nolan's epic conclusion to his Batman trilogy transcends the confines of the genre, elevating it to the realm of modern mythology.

Set in a Gotham City teetering on the brink of anarchy, the film explores the cost of heroism and the intricate dance between light and darkness. Christian Bale, reprising his role as the brooding vigilante, brings a raw and tormented humanity to Bruce Wayne, reminding us that beneath the mask lies a fractured soul seeking redemption.

Tom Hardy's Bane, a menacing force of chaos, proves to be a formidable adversary, and his presence looms large over every frame. His chillingly measured voice and brute strength make him a worthy counterpart to the Caped Crusader.

What truly sets ""The Dark Knight Rises"" apart is its unflinching examination of the human spirit. It delves into themes of fear, pain, sacrifice, and the indomitable will to rise in the face of adversity. The film challenges us to confront our own inner demons and question the nature of heroism.

The technical prowess on display is nothing short of breathtaking. Hans Zimmer's haunting score serves as the heartbeat of the film, and Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grandeur and grit of Gotham City with equal finesse. The practical effects, especially during the mesmerizing aerial sequences, ground the film in a visceral reality that few superhero movies achieve.

While some may find fault in the film's ambitious narrative and its occasional leaps of logic, these imperfections only add to its allure. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" refuses to spoon-feed its audience, instead demanding engagement and contemplation.

In conclusion, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a masterful conclusion to one of the most celebrated trilogies in cinematic history. It's a symphony of chaos and redemption, a testament to the enduring power of storytelling, and a reminder that heroes can rise, even in the darkest of times. This is not merely a superhero movie; it's a cinematic journey that resonates on a profound level, leaving a lasting imprint on the."
"For a while, I maintained that this was the best of the Dark Knight trilogy. Watching it for the first time in a few years, I can certainly see why. The second half is pure spectacle filmmaking at an epic scale with an extended set piece that feels expansive and alive and huge all at once. However, that first hour or so is much messier, and I think that last half of the film, largely got me to ignore some of the niggling issues that frontend the film.

The Batman has been absent from Gotham City for eight years. In that time, Gotham has seen a period of peace and prosperity it has not experienced in a very long time. In order to create that sense of calm, though, Police Commissioner Gordon pumped up the idol of Harvey Dent who had become the psychopathic villain Two-Face, murdered several people, and threatened to kill Gordon's son as the White Knight, blaming all of his crimes on Batman. Together with the Mayor and the City Council, they passed the Dent Act which allowed for aggressive anti-crime actions on the part of the police, resulting in a city without any serious organized crime at all. In this time, Bruce Wayne, Batman's alter ego, has become a recluse, having spent several post-Batman years and half of his fortune pursuing a fusion reactor before suddenly shutting it down and closing himself off from the world.

In enters Bane, a member of the League of Shadows and a former acolyte of Ra's Al Ghul, since excommunicated for his extreme methods. After the death of Ra's Al Ghul, Bane took over the League of Shadows and will continue the man's mission of burning Gotham to the ground, much like the League had done to Rome and London before it. The revolution he ignites is based heavily on the Jacobins of France during the French Revolution, which fits hand in hand with the overall movie's ties to Charles Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities. He speaks of equality, but he rules with an iron fist, establishing a Committee for Public Safety, so to speak, that summarily executes enemies of the revolution. In order to get there, though, Bane must take control of Gotham.

Now, the first half of the film is really setup for the giant spectacle that dominates the second half, and some of it is quite good and other elements end up going a bit too far. From beginning to end, I think Bane is great. He's intimidating physically and he ends up with a great plan to acquire wealth and demean Batman at the same time. Stealing his fingerprints through Catwoman/Selina Kyle to fake reckless options trading that wipes out his position in Wayne Enterprises is wonderful. The chase out of the Stock Exchange, giving Bruce Wayne his first moment as Batman in eight years, is exciting and well filmed. That it leaves Wayne so destitute that he can't pay his own power bill is...curious and a step too far. I get the point. The point is to take Wayne as low as possible both as Batman and as Wayne himself, but having his power shut off because of nonpayment roughly a day after his loses all his money feels weird at best and completely ignorant of how things work in the real world at worst.

Another very good thing that the first hour does is establish the overall thematic thrust of the film, and that's around pain. Bruce is suffering from a leg injury. That's good. He immediately gets cured well enough to fight as Batman again because of a gadget on his leg. That's...less good. And yet, the idea runs through the rest of it very well. Wayne carries the pain of his loss of Rachel Dawes, from The Dark Knight (to the point that people misinterpret his receding from the world due to that loss, but that's not the case). Gordon carries the pain of having to defend the man who tried to kill his son, while losing that son in a divorce at the same time. The city carries the scars of past trauma brought on by the Joker, but it manages to live on, just as Gordon does. And what do these people do with their pain? Well, more pain must come first.

Bane's efforts to take the city end up feeling great. He has an inside man at Wayne Enterprises, also knows that Wayne is Batman because of his connection to the League of Shadows, and he uses the greed of Daggett, a wealthy executive who wants to absorb Wayne Enterprises, to prepare his plan of cutting off the city from the rest of the world. But first, he must take out the Batman. That the ""every police officer"" gets trapped in the sewars is...less good, though. It's another step too far that didn't quite need to be taken. However, this element of the plot is where Selena Kyle is useful.

Anne Hathaway as Selena Kyle is really good. She can switch between woundedly scared and feminine to coyly vicious and feminine in an instant. She steals into Wayne Manor as a servant at a party and shows both sides to Bruce as she steals his mother's pearls and his fingerprints, setting up the plot of the film. She's a survivor with a chip on her shoulder, so she's happy to watch as Bruce loses everything as the result of her actions. However she does still have a certain sense of justice so when Bane completely takes over and Gotham descends into a hellscape reminiscent of the French Terror, she's bothered by it, but being a survivor she does little to stop or escape it.

The movie turns when Batman has his confrontation with Bane. Evoking the famous comics scenario of Bane breaking Batman's back in the Knightfall run (pretty much the only time I was reading comics, by the way), Bane breaks Batman and sends him to a prison with hope, the worst punishment he can imagine. The visual image of Bruce needing to rise from the pit in order to overcome his pain and fear is great. That it takes him so much effort and that he has to essentially return to an earlier form of himself in order to do it is even better. There's such rich imagery here.

The final confrontation between Batman, as a symbol of order, and Bane, as a symbol of chaos and fire, dominates the last half of the movie. The film leaves open some unimportant questions of how Bruce Wayne gets from India to Gotham in about three weeks, but considering the character's history of running in the underworld, including in the Far East, that seems easily filled in by the audience, and once he's there he leads an all out rebellion against the ruling Revolutionary government with an aim towards getting his hands on the nuclear bomb set to go off in twelve hours. Yeah, it's very comic booky, but it's handled with the right balance of seriousness that I think the movie sells the situation well.

And in terms of the final act, the spectacle of Batman leading an army in a war against Bane for control of Gotham and against a Jacobin Revolution is great. Batman the symbol leads those who had cowered away in fear to take to the streets, fulfilling the promise of Batman as a symbol established in the first movie (and re-explained to Blake, the cop who has figured out that Wayne is Batman in...another individual step that feels too far in the first half). The evocation of A Tale of Two Cities also helps provide the film a literary understructure that I appreciate. It's not just random bad guys butting up against a protagonist we all know from pop culture. It's a literary extension of the mythos.

I feel like this was a bit of a ramble, but I'm gonna stick with it. The Dark Knight Rises is not a perfect movie. Its first half ends up taking a few ideas too far, which undermines them slightly, but not the overall story. What ends up carrying it all, though, is Nolan's sheer command of everything outside the script. Performances are very good. The spectacle is great. The use of image and sound creates a large story that carries interesting ideas about pain and the efforts to deal with it. It's an intelligent and rousing film that could have been a bit tighter, but, by the end, I don't really care that much."
"The Dark Knight Rises is so amazing!! Arguably one of the best & most underrated CBM's of all time. Although it is slow at times, the 3rd act is superb and so intriguing. I love all the characters in this film Catwoman, Bane, Natalia and especially Blake as he is such an amazing edition to this movie. It's such an amazing end to this wonderful trilogy. This twist in this film is fantastic and works so well and if I'm gonna be honest, TDKR ending is one of my favourites in any film!! Overall The Dark Knight Rises is so good and I love it a lot."
"The Dark Knight Rises arrived in cinemas on the back of deafening hype. The astronomical expectations seemed insurmountable for even a visionary of Christopher Nolan's caliber. So does Nolan deliver? Absolutely! Bold and unflinching, Nolan's operatic style makes The Dark Knight Rises an art piece of boundless spectacle and an epic of never-seen-before scope and scale. It visually obliterates the modern blockbuster with a story of daring boldness, taking your inner child on a savage ride.

The final chapter of Nolan's trilogy kicks off exactly eight years after the end of The Dark Knight. The streets of Gotham have been cleaned up but as we soon find out, all that means is that the criminals have moved underground. Having taken the fall for the death of Harvey Dent, Bruce Wayne, the tycoon behind the cowl, now lives like a specter hobbling about the recesses of his fancy mansion while his faithful butler Alfred frets over him like a gawking mother goose. But something is stirring deep beneath Gotham's streets, and it is not long before Wayne once again finds himself staring into the heart of human darkness. When a hulking, masked psycho named Bane lays siege to his financial empire and plants a series of strategically placed explosives beneath the city, intending to cut off the isle's citizenry from the outside world, he hauls the bat-suit out of storage.

From there, the movie unfolds with the carefully measured pacing of an epic, that rare sequel that endeavors to deepen and expand upon what has come before rather than merely repackaging it. It returns us to Gotham and its denizens, taking its time, gradually showing us the lay of the land. And once the cogs start whirring and the machine starts to warm up, The Dark Knight Rises takes off like a rocket – with Hans Zimmer's propulsive score as its fuel. And when it fires on all cylinders, it enters classic territory.

The pedigree of the cast imparts automatic gravitas to the movie. Christian Bale gives us a Batman with a haunted quality, showing Wayne broken, rising, and risen in perfect succession. Gary Oldman retains his quiet dignity as Commissioner Gordon. Michael Caine's Alfred continues to class up the joint. Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle, is sexy, confident, and offers a great balance of humor. As Officer John Blake, Joseph Gordon-Levitt musters an interesting blend of earnestness and intensity. Both Marion Cotillard and Morgan Freeman execute their parts with precision. And Hardy is sensational as the diabolical antagonist Bane. He bites into his character's motivations and transcends the movie to a place that is darker and more malicious.

Nolan gives us an intellectual, heart-pounding movie that grips like a vice from minute one and never lets go, capping off the trilogy with passion and dignity and with slam-bang entertainment. The Dark Knight Rises is both the conclusion the franchise needs and the conclusion it deserves!"
"The dark knight rises is a marvelous conclusion to Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. Everything is top notch in this movie. The acting, the writing, the cinematography, the storyline, the visual effects are all perfect in this movie Just Awesome"
"Bale made Batman fearsome and intense, whoever gave the go to make Bale Batman had a good idea"
A perfect conclusion to the Christopher Bale series of The Batman movies
"The best Bruce Wayne we've ever gotten in a movie. Every scene with him and the other characters, especially Alfred, are some of the best of the trilogy. The strongest part of the movie, for me, is the prison sequence with Bruce. I get chills every time he makes the climb.... everything surrounding him is flawless in my eyes.

My main negatives that bring the score down are the eventual arcs of the villains in the movie and honestly Anne Hathaway does not work in these types of roles. Some of the plot elements feel a bit rushed and don't pack nearly as big of a punch as The Dark Knight. Bane's takeover of the city feels far less believable than the Joker's.

Despite those flaws, it's hard to end a trilogy with this good of an entry. I think, thematically, its brilliant and it's also a fantastic story for Bruce Wayne's character.

This ending is also incredible, and I get chills every time I see it. Hans Zimmer's score is legendary."
"The only thing that made me laugh harder at the theater than the ""drama"" foisted upon the audience was the subset of audience members themselves who actually took this seriously. the last batman movie i saw in theaters was 15 years ago. i did enjoy the original films. they were always usually pretty fun and entertaining and i thought maybe this would be similar. i hadnt seen the other 2 movies in this newer set all the way through before seeing this so i didn't get what exactly was going on, but all sequels usually aren't connected with the previous ones all that much, but i guess this one was. In all seriousness, I've never laughed so hard at a film that tried to take itself this seriously. the comic book feel of the other films has vanished completely and instead we are given a very bland, boring, ""average"" movie that really doesn't feel much like anything batman-related. i cant believe the rating for this movie! its utterly ridiculous. my guess is its the hype and hype alone. the movie itself is instantly forgettable and i hope whatever other movies they make go back to the old style of batmans, not this law and order rubbish. my advice is this movie is a total waste of 2 hours and if you want a real good batman movie watch the tim burton movies from the 90's. oh and the val kilmer one too:)"
"I enjoyed the movie, fun, fast paced action as we expected, but there were waaaay too unrealistic exaggerated, and even absurd scenes, in my opinion.The best example of this is when Bruce Wayne escaped from being imprisoned for a long time in a hole that was hundrets, thousands of miles away, being alone and without resources and very wounded to go back to a Gotham City who was completely CLOSED for anyone to enter and exit just in the perfect moment to be in a suit and meet Catwoman and say an 'americanish' catchphrase. This is the ugliest example, but there are more moments when very alert action stops for a kiss between selina and batman or for the villain to tell the story of their life just before killing Batman...These scenes made me facepalm hard... Overall, a fun action packed movie which makes you jump off your seat a lot of times, but fails to meet the Dark Knight expectations."
"This is more than just the conclusion to a trilogy-it's the final chapter of a hero's journey that's as personal as it is epic. From the moment the film begins, you're pulled into a Gotham that's teetering on the edge, and Bruce Wayne, weary and broken, must summon the strength to don the cape once more. Christian Bale brings a raw humanity to Bruce, making his struggle against Bane-a villain unlike any Batman has faced before-feel intensely personal. As Gotham falls into chaos, you feel the weight of every decision, every sacrifice, and every blow that Bruce takes.

What makes The Dark Knight Rises resonate so deeply is its focus on the man behind the mask. It's not just about Batman fighting to save Gotham; it's about Bruce Wayne fighting to find himself again, to reclaim his life after years of pain and loss. The film's action is breathtaking, but it's the quieter moments-the glimpses of Bruce's vulnerability, the loyalty of his allies, the hope for a better tomorrow-that truly stay with you. The ending, filled with both closure and new beginnings, leaves you feeling uplifted, reminding you that even in the darkest times, there's always a reason to rise. The Dark Knight Rises isn't just an action-packed spectacle; it's a deeply human story about redemption, resilience, and the enduring power of hope."
"The Dark Knight Rises had to be stunning and spectacular and brilliant just...because. After a very good start with Batman Begins and a truly magnificent follow-up with The Dark Knight how could Christopher Nolan go wrong? Expectations were off the charts. And those expectations were not quite met. Nolan certainly didn't get it all wrong but he surely didn't get it all right either. There's no way around it, this film is not as good as The Dark Knight. Does that mean it's a total letdown? No, not at all. It just means it is not the glorious triumph everyone expected. It's a satisfying finish to a great trilogy. People were just hoping to be able to use a better word than ""satisfying"".

So why does this film not measure up to the last one? Well there are a few reasons but one stands out above the rest. It's glaring and obvious and there was nothing Nolan could have done about it. This film misses Heath Ledger's Joker. Bane is an ominous presence. But a rather dull one. And what the heck is he saying anyway? The Joker had a manic intensity to him that this film sorely misses. Stretched out to almost three hours, clearly too long for its own good, this film desperately needed some real jolts along the way. Someone had to grab a hold of the story and shake the audience up. The Joker did that, Bane does not. Yes, Bane is frightening and foreboding and clearly very dangerous. But the personality just isn't there. There's no sense of wonder. The Joker always had you on your toes, what would he do next? Bane never intrigues you that way.

If you miss the Joker it could also be said that this film leaves you missing Batman. Christian Bale is solid as ever in the dual role of Bruce and Bat but in this film he spends very little time in that famous costume. We see an awful lot of Bruce Wayne, very little of Batman. The other familiar faces from the first two films are back. Gary Oldman and Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman doing what they do. New characters? Well, there's Anne Hathaway doing a better than expected job playing Selina Kyle, who's kinda sorta maybe but not really Catwoman. Marion Cotillard plays Miranda Tate, investor in a Wayne Enterprises energy project. This character is woefully underdeveloped which proves to be problematic. Tom Hardy does the best he can with Bane, a very challenging villain to portray. Hidden away behind a mask it's hard to infuse the character with any personality. And again, seriously, what the heck is he saying? And there's Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing young police officer John Blake who knows Bruce Wayne is Batman just...because.

The fact this nobody cop knows Batman's identity is not the only disappointing contrivance required to move the plot along. The location of Bane's lair? Convenient. The entire Gotham police force trapping themselves underground? Very, very convenient. And dumb. And let us not even delve into Bruce Wayne's remarkable healing powers. This is a story which at times really struggles for momentum. With the Joker around lack of energy was never going to be a problem in the last film. Here things really get bogged down on more than one occasion. But while the film certainly has its flaws it does ultimately manage to satisfy. The trilogy gets the big sendoff it deserves. The Dark Knight Rises doesn't reach the spectacular heights of Nolan's last Batman effort so maybe you come away a touch disappointed. But taken on its own merits this is a good film. True greatness may elude it but it is a worthy end to a terrific saga."
"A horrible, bloated, clumsy and often surprisingly amateurish mess that constantly reaches for profoundly unearned emotions and falsely pumped-up thrills.

Ann Hathaway's Catwoman is, by miles, the best thing in this overcrowded, misguided concoction (of course she's never called Catwoman, because ultimately Nolan is embarrassed to be doing a super hero movie, as virtually every creative decision he makes here proves). But like anything else that might even be a little bit interesting in this movie, her character and storyline are steamrolled with the rest of the ingredients into a flat, boring cacophony.

The music is relentlessly pounding, probably in the hopes that you wont notice how rickety and poorly crafted the story is.

Christian Bale virtually phones in his performance. He plays Batman as a mouth-breather (he actually never closes his mouth when in the cowl, making Batman look like some poor kid at summer camp with severe allergies) and he's incapable of bringing the slightest touch of character to Bruce Wayne. Where is Batman the master martial artist? The World's Greatest Detective? The unstoppable force of nature? Not here. Not in this movie.

And the amazing Tom Hardy? Completely wasted and mostly unintelligible.

The script is a train wreck. There are more plot holes and leaps of logic in this film than in the Avengers, and that movie had a Norse God fighting alongside a monster of science against giant interdimensional worms. The Avengers, by the way, was twice as fun, which was expected, but shockingly, only half as stupid as this movie.

Here, let me give you a rundown of terrible, terrible logic loops, sustained stupidity, and just flat out disregard the for audience's intelligence. SPOILERS!

1. A massive terrorist raid on the stock exchange to make a single trade that leaves Bruce Wayne Broke. Okay... what the f.u.c.k.? A. Hacking a computer system does not require proximal space violence. It's called hacking. B. You're telling me they didn't shut down the stock exchange in a crises situation? C. No one questioned a massive trade that rendered one of the wealthiest men in the world broke, when that trade was performed in the middle of a destructive high-speed chase that would have been news across the entire country, let alone the entire world?

2. Batman and Bruce Wayne are the least interesting characters to the filmmakers. Batman's time on screen is incidental and his actions boring. It is a Batman film with no interest in Batman at all.

3. The Harvey Dent tough-on-crime bill has ended crime? Have you ever seen, in your lifetime, a city go from total social meltdown to utopia where the cops have nothing to do, because of a single bill that was passed? Later, when Gordon knows Dent didn't die a hero, he doesn't tell anyone, because somehow this will make the law less effective? For all his desire to make a ""real world"" superhero film, Nolan obviously has no idea about how the real world works. Toon Town in the Roger Rabbit movie had a more realistic governing set of laws.

4. Bruce Wayne is in prison forever and we hear the same damn story told over and over and over again, and it's all gender neutral so they can have one last tedious reveal at the end.

5. ""Your spinal vertebrae is sticking out of your back, here let me just punch it in! GHA! There much better. Only a matter of time before you're batman again.""

6. I once saw an episode of Vice Travel where some journalist bought a dirty bomb in Chechnya for a handful of cash. Yeah. But Bane doesn't like doing things the easy way. God forbid he just buy a bomb from a corrupt ex-soviet general. No, instead he elaborately fakes the death of a scientist (apparently the only nuclear physicist in the world, by the way), waits for Wayne to build a fusion generator beneath Gotham so he can then steal its core and use it as an atomic bomb to hold ALL OF GOTHAM hostage. Then kills the scientist.

7. It takes five months for the US to send special ops into Gotham? Really? Let's say Gotham is New York, which it is in this ponderous piece of crap. Let's say a terrorist was holding New York Hostage... for five months. You're telling me that the citizens of New York, that the military of the United States, that the nuclear scientists of the world... are going to let that happen? That the people won't rise up immediately, that the military won't have drones flying around constantly looking for radiation signatures and have infiltrated the whole damn island with special ops, that the scientists won't figure out a way to drop EMP pulse grenades across the island to shut down the mechanical device that triggers the fission explosion? Five months of just sitting on their hands?

8. An atomic explosion off the coast of Gotham, and everything's cool! No worries! Radiation fallout? Na. Poisoned ocean? Forget about it. No big deal.

9. And the worst crime of all, the co-opting of the OCCUPY RHETORIC to disenfranchise the movement. Occupy Wall St. slogans are readily and repeatedly spoken by a monstrous, mad, deceiving, mass murdering terrorist. Do we ever see the plight of the average joe in DK Rises? Never. Which is shocking since there are about 300 characters, each with more screen time than Batman. What we get is a real life political movement used in the fictional service of Kangaroo Courts, martial law, and dictatorship. I don't care if Nolan meant for Bane to be using the language of Occupy for his own corrupt and selfish ends, it's irresponsible filmmaking.

And that's just some of the eye-rolling stupidity packed into this thing.

All and all, DK Rises is tedious, boring crap."
A thrilling epic conclusion to the dark knight film saga. this has to be one of the best ending films of all time Christopher Nolan did an excellent job the effects were great the music was cool the plot was amazing the characters were well thought of and the dark feeling of it make it amazing. people lets give Christopher Nolan a long applause
"The perfect conclusion to the perfect trilogy.

Nolan's third and final installment of this series is one of the most hard hitting, emotional thrill rides I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing. The final resolution is executed in the most beautifully cinematic way possible. I don't have any criticism of this film at all, it's such a carefully crafted film that if I had to list something negative, I would have to nitpick, and in this 2 hour and 40 minute classic, that simply would be an exercise in futility. The film gets so much right with it's themes and characters, that it hits every note perfectly just like it's two predecessors do. 10/10"
"In 2012, director Christopher Nolan delivered the epic conclusion to his groundbreaking Batman trilogy with ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Set against the backdrop of Gotham City's descent into chaos, this gripping tale of redemption, sacrifice, and heroism solidified Nolan's status as a visionary filmmaker and left audiences spellbound from start to finish.

From the jaw-dropping action sequences to the thought-provoking themes woven throughout the narrative, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a cinematic tour de force that transcends the superhero genre. At its core, the film explores the timeless struggle between good and evil, as Batman, portrayed with raw intensity by Christian Bale, grapples with his own inner demons while facing off against the formidable villain Bane, played with chilling menace by Tom Hardy.

What sets ""The Dark Knight Rises"" apart from other superhero films is its depth and complexity. Nolan skillfully crafts a multi-layered narrative that challenges viewers to confront difficult questions about power, justice, and the nature of heroism. As the stakes escalate and Gotham teeters on the brink of destruction, the film forces us to reckon with the consequences of our actions and the choices we make in the pursuit of a better world.

Visually stunning and thematically rich, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a feast for the senses that demands to be experienced on the big screen. From the breathtaking aerial shots of Gotham's skyline to the pulse-pounding showdowns between Batman and his adversaries, every frame is meticulously crafted to immerse viewers in the dark and gritty world of Gotham City.

In addition to its spectacular action sequences, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is anchored by a stellar ensemble cast that delivers powerhouse performances across the board. Anne Hathaway shines as the enigmatic cat burglar Selina Kyle, while Michael Caine delivers a heart-wrenching portrayal of Bruce Wayne's loyal butler, Alfred. Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt round out the ensemble with performances that are both compelling and nuanced.

Overall, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a triumph of storytelling and filmmaking that delivers on every level. With its exhilarating action, thought-provoking themes, and unforgettable performances, it cements Christopher Nolan's legacy as one of the greatest directors of our time and solidifies Batman's status as a cultural icon. Whether you're a die-hard fan of the Caped Crusader or simply a lover of great cinema, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a must-watch that will leave you breathless until the very end."
"Batman has defeated Ras-al-Ghul and his ninjas. He's defeated the Joker, a madman who only wanted to see the world burn. But now he faces Bane, a man who grew up in the world's darkest, cruelest dungeon. A man so dangerous he was excommunicated from the League of Shadows. A man with thousands of followers and millions of dollars at his disposal. And despite what the people closest to him say, Gotham needs Batman more than ever. Because in order to live up to his last Batman movie, Christopher Nolan has upped every stake and pulled every stop.

Looking back, it's obvious that no one could top Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker. None of the other villains in Batman's rouges gallery could be as frightening or disturbing as his Joker. But in Ed Hardy's Bane, Nolan has found a villain more powerful and far more dangerous. Bane is perhaps the ultimate physical combatant; massive, incredibly strong, all but impervious to pain. Comic book fans know him as the man who put Bruce Wayne in a wheelchair, and here he does worse. And he is very smart, and totally insane. The Joker was like a serial killer, a mad dog. Bane's madness is one of megalomania and unfettered hatred. The Joker sought to corrupt; he seeks to dominate and to destroy.

And yet he has the gall to present himself as a hero, a liberator. After entombing the entire police force and taking Gotham hostage, he claims that he is giving the city back to the people, that he is giving them freedom from those in power who have oppressed and exploited them, that he has brought justice and equality. But he lies. His freedom is nothing more than anarchy, the freedom to kill and steal. His justice is a mockery of the word in which having too much wealth or being part of the old order are capital crimes. His equality is the wholesale liquidation of the rich, leaving a world in which everyone is equally poor. In throwing down the old order built on law and the power of wealth, he has built a new one based on fear and the power of the gun. And it's all just preparation for ultimate destruction.

Against this mad warlord Batman's help comes from the unlikeliest of sources; master thief Catwoman (Anne Hathaway). When we meet her she's motivated only by money and self preservation, and like any good thief she convinces herself that t she's only stealing from those who can afford to lose it. She warns Batman that there's a storm coming, and he and his friends had best prepare. But when her storm arrives she realizes the old truth that you should be careful what you wish for. Hathaway's charm and wit make her perfect for this role, and her acrobatic fighting moves are stunning. I think it's safe to say that the last remaining taint of the Halle Berry version has been lifted from the character.

Nolan has outdone himself with the action sequences. The opening scene is every bit as forceful and unsettling as the one in Dark Night, with a coolness factor that rivals the best of James Bond. The climactic battle between Gotham's finest and Bane's thugs is one of the largest and most spectacular scenes of its kind, with hundreds of combatants crowding the city streets.. And the fights between Batman and Bane are everything fanboys could hope for. Eschewing precision and flair, these showdowns are brutally physical, with the effects of every blow being seen and heard. For me, this was one of the most satisfying brawls since Sean Connery took on Robert Shaw nearly fifty years ago.

This final installment in the franchise doesn't have a many twists and turns as its predecessor, but the ones it does have are still impressive. Bane's plans are a bit simpler than the Joker's, but no less genius, and he is equally as adept at predicting his opponents' moves. And although leaked information from an entertainment blog had given me foreknowledge of one major revelation, I was totally unprepared for the manner of this revelation and its effect on the story.

This is also a film rich with subtext. Bane's violent overthrow of Gotham's powers that be and his iron-fisted reign form a microcosm of countless violent revolutions. It could easily be a stand for the French Revolution, the Ayatollah's rise in Iran, or any of the various communist revolutions. In a period of unprecedented bloodshed and chaos, a determined man overthrows the old regime, only to replace it with one far worse. And just like Stalin or Mao, Bane knows that he's not doing any of this for the people. The only difference is that he doesn't even need to win public support, because he already has his mercenaries and thousands of released convicts.

The Dark Knight Rises may not be as scary as the last film, it's not quite as deep, and I will admit that it lacks any performance to equal Heath Ledger's. But it is smart, thrilling, action packed and suspenseful. It's dark and brooding without being overpowering, and it does an excellent job of linking the narrative back to the first film. It is the summer's best movie and a worthy end for the Dark Night Trilogy."
"I have not seen the movie but I read a post on Facebook I really liked. That Christian Bale should visit the kids who were injured by the Aurora killings,in the real Batman suit. Please post this to Facebook, other IMDb reviews, etc. And so he can show the kids that heroes really do exist,not just the evil people Satan has affected. He is working overtime because he knows his time is almost up. Dear Christian Bale, please visit the injured children from the movie massacre as Batman, you have the power to be a hero right now,not a movie hero,a real life flesh and bone one. I did not write this I found it on Facebook, I stole it because it was amazing what this person put on Facebook."
"Great film with some stunning effects and shots, such as the homage to King Kong with a 180 degree pan of Batman on top of Gotham building. Great actors, but what happened to the sound? Seems a lot of the dialogue is unintelligible to native English speakers over 45 years old. My kids could hear fine, but my wife and I and the press at the London screening couldn't decipher the dialogue at times. 'Most of us at the press show couldn't even hear the dialogue' said Nigel Andrews, the Financial Times reviewer on July 19th 2012.

I don't know about you, but I hate missing out on dialogue, especially in a Nolan film where there are bound to be great subtleties at play that will heighten the overall film experience. So the chief sound editor should certainly be up for a Razzie. Trouble is, there doesn't look in the crew list like there was a chief sound editor and perhaps that was the problem."
"This is so great. A great finale to one of the best trilogies of all time. Tom Hardy, Anne Hathaway and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are great additions to the cast and they give an amazing performance. The main characters are all so incredible. And the film is intense and full of breathtaking moments. Including a great plot twist. This gives an amazing ending that leaves the viewer wanting more from it. Overall an excellent film. Score - 10"
"disagreeing with most reviews i've read so far i thought the movie was flat. It just seem to never find it's footing. i found myself bored at times and had no problem getting up to get more popcorn in the middle of the movie. Catwoman was awesome. i really wish there was more of her in the movie. bane was not quite as awesome. he just didn't give me that omg what is he going to do feeling that i got with heath. I also dislike that they reused plot items from previous installments, it would have been better without the connection. The middle of the movie is like a long montage that could have been given some theme music and condensed to about 10 min. dkr had an overall bad flow which brushed over things that could have been flushed out more and dwelled on things that could have done with out.

The movie is worth a watch but don't expect to be blown away like with the dark knight."
"I am a huge fan of batman director Christopher Nolan. He is the genius who brought us such groundbreaking films as Memento and Inception, the very good Batman Begins and the excellent The Dark Night.

That's why my hopes for this third installment were so high. Boy was i disappointed.

This movie is a GRAND MESS. Here are some of the reasons why:

Nolan cuts off batman's balls and holds them hostage the entire movie. He is either hobbling around as Bruce Wayne looking like he belongs in a Senior's Home or in his batman's suit trading punches like an aged boxer with MS. No great fight scenes in the inimitable batman style with the whooshing and swooshing and swooping and gadgets and disappearances/reappearances.

I would conjecture that this is both because of the post modern philosophy adopted that no man is a true hero (including batman) and also more practically because the fight team was actually changed from the first two movies to a new one for this film, a change drastically for the worse. They should have stuck to the Keysi Fighting Method.

Another error is that any movie is only as good as its villain and Bane is a horrible villain. He's really more like a big goon that the main villain usually sends in the eleventh hour to do his bidding like the big Russian guy in the Punisher for example. Don't expect another performance like Ledger's Joker here.

What really gets me though, is how the second film developed the whole origin of Twoface as Harvey Dent (who was a great character) and then just dropped it and brought in a much worse villain????

Extremely irritating was Nolan superimposing the Inception style of for example heavy background music etc on this film where it doesn't belong. Even the dialogue was hard to always pick out, especially when you have two of the main characters growling through masks and the war drums right beneath their voices.

But it didn't stop there. Nolan invited almost the entire Inception cast and stuck them into this film inflating the story by giving them non- essential roles and by constantly taking you out of the illusion of reality a film is supposed to create when it forces another much better film to come to mind. He and his buds must have been having such a good time on set enjoying the Inception reunion that they must have forgot they were filming an entirely different movie.

The cherry on the top of this egregious casting is when in the middle of the film you suddenly have a cameo by none other than Cilian Murphy the scarecrow villain in the first Batman movie as some minor people elected judge. (And yes, you guessed it, he was also in Inception). To me that's tantamount to giving Heath Ledger (Joker) or Aaron Eckhart (Harvey Dent) a role as a cop or a waiter in this film. Seriously man, is there anything else you can do wrong to break the movie spell and keep reminding me i'm only watching a film with actors- something totally fake?

I wish i could stop here but honestly i could go on and on. The movie spends time with characters whose story lines are not that interesting and leads up to a cliché climax that you and i have seen done in previous TV shows like 24 and other films.

I believe the production suffered from the all too common problem of having too large a budget (250 million) that enabled Nolan to create a spectacle of ""Sound and Fury Signifying Nothing"" instead of an interesting film. The film alternates between dragging with boring exposition and blasting your ears off with nonsense. There is a tender moment between Bruce and Alfred that is very brief that was nice though ;)....

Guys, I went into the theatre ready to love this film, willing to try to like it, but it never even gave me the chance.

Unfortunately it does not live up to the hype. Like the Godfather Part 3, there is no reason to watch it even though you enjoyed the great Parts 1 and 2.

Let sleeping dogs lie and let dead films die. For your own sake, do not break the caution tape to watch this wretched bomb of a film."
"A very satisfying ending to a great trilogy that leaves you wanting even more. Not just a good superhero movie, but a great movie overall. This is my favorite movie of all time hands down. Acting is phenomenal and brings one of my childhood idols to light in a cinematic masterpiece that Christopher Nolan created which tailors to a more adult audience. Solid 9.95/10."
"The Dark Knight Rises may not only be my favorite Batman movie of all time (yes I like it more than The Dark Knight), but it may also be my favorite movie of all time. There are no words to describe how much I love this movie. The Dark Knight Rises has one of the best endings in the history of film. Bane is one of the best villains of all time and I wish that he got more attention. 10/10"
"The Dark Knight Rises, helming a rating of 8.4 on IMDB and still a high holder on the top 250 movies list is a prove that despite some people feeling dissatisfied towards this epic conclusion, it is still universally beloved as a movie, and as one might dare to say, a great superhero movie.

Watching this film for the first time in theaters, with no knowledge of filmmaking, not even a movie fan at that time, just a normal audience going in the theatres for a ride, I remember coming out completely satisfied and floored. This film still crowns the most pristine look for an action film. The cinematography, the snow falling in the city of Gotham, everything about the visuals of this film is just screaming awesomeness, and for the longest time I hold this film as the pinnacle of the best looking action film and I still do.

In many ways, the minor flaws in here is so insignificant compare to the memorable bits of the film. This rendition of cat woman is by far the best one ever. Anne Hathaway achieves the perfect balance of sexiness and the feminine wit in this character, the visual design is also perfect. Bane is such an underrated villain, Tom Hardy adds so much on the character's simple motivation, the menace through his voice and his physicality rivals Batman and his energy brought so much to the tension we felt in the film. The opening and ending scene is one of the best in movie cinema.

One of my favourite aspects of this film is how Nolan coins the genre of the superhero saga into a prison break movie. The design of the pit is visually so mesmerizing, every time the camera points up to the light and we see the cave of the prison, the picture just becomes this visceral canvas of beauty in horror. The moment when Bruce Wayne confronts his true fear by foregoing the only security from the rope, it's honestly so badass that it trumps every other character moment in any Marvel movies and DC movies for that matter.

After so many years, there's still not one DCEU movie that achieves this style of epic grounded action thriller where Nolan single-handedly master in Hollywood. It's only until 2016 where Denis Villeneuve finally managed to make something that comes close to that level of authentic grandness.

The Dark Knight Rises also has the best score in the trilogy in my opinion, the best score for any hero movies, the perfect balance of grandness, epicness, the unsung melancholy and the haunting beauty of romantic sacrifice."
"I think the protagonist of this movie isn't BATMAN, but Joseph Gordon, who grew up in the orphanage and played the role of police inspector ""BLAKE"". If Blake wasn't there, Gotham had gone out hand :)"
"Fantastic film. Everything about the film is perfect. The cgi is amazing, acting is prefect, script is effective, plot is quick and exciting. To top the film off, the ending is also enjoyable rather than being boring and generic"
"And Christopher Nolan's genre-changing series of Batman films finally comes to a close with THE DARK KNIGHT RISES. No matter what your opinions are of Nolan's Batman movies, you have to admit that they've had an effect on latest generation of superhero movies to arrive in theaters. With his trilogy finally complete and the all those involved moving on to other projects, I'll be curious to see where the comic book movie genre goes next. When I first saw THE DARK KNIGHT RISES in theaters (a midnight showing, of course, and one of the few I've attended), I admit I was initially disappointed but additional viewings have helped me appreciate it a lot more. The movie is set eight years following the events of THE DARK KNIGHT with Batman going on the run and the true details of Harvey Dent's death buried in hopes of using him as Gotham's shining hero. The city has enjoyed a time of peace as crime is at an all-time low, but this is all about to change. A terrorist named Bane has his sights set on Gotham. He arises under the guise as a freedom fighter with the goal of bringing the upper class to their knees while the lower class are allowed to rise to power, but Bane is no hero. Bruce Wayne returns to don the costume and investigate Bane but his time away from crime fighting has left him weakened. His initial confrontation with Bane leaves him broken, and Wayne must find the strength to return and, with help from a professional cat burglar, save Gotham from total destruction.

To put my views in perspective, I am a Nolan fan and I love his Batman movies. THE DARK KNIGHT is one of my favorite movies and I loved BATMAN BEGINS so much that it was one of the few movies I shelled out cash to see in theaters multiple times. So yes, my views are a little skewed toward the positive side. But my initial impressions of the final movie weren't as generous. It was a fine movie, sure, but it failed to live up to the immense hype I'd built in my own mind prior to seeing the movie. I knew Nolan would have a hard time topping THE DARK KNIGHT and I accepted this. I also reminded myself that Nolan's Batman universe isn't exactly the same as that of the comics and details were going to be fudged to make them fit in the overarching story he was attempting to tell. With a near 3 hour runtime, I was in no mood to humor these factors when I saw it in theaters and I walked away befuddled with my issues with the movie. It was slower paced, Wayne doesn't don the costume enough in the movie, and the finale was anticlimactic. But, over time and two more viewings on my own, I realize that this movie was a lot better than I was giving it credit for. Sure, there are still some plot issues I'm not a fan of but I remind myself that this is Nolan's Batman and any problems I have will probably be retcon'd in the next Batman reboot anyway. Just enjoy the Nolan series for what it is. And I do.

At a second glance, there is a lot about this movie I really like. Tom Hardy as Bane is just awesome. His bizarre voice took a minute to become acclimated with; it reminded me of Sean Connery talking through a tin can. Once I got used to his voice, Bane rose to become one of the best Batman villains that have been put to film yet, though not as remarkable as Heath Ledger's Joker (but, seriously, I don't see anyone topping that anytime soon). He is massive, intimidating presence and a perfect challenge for a Batman who's fallen into disrepair. What better motivation to rise than a madman with an insidious plan and the muscle to pound our hero into dust? On a related note, Anne Hathaway was an excellent choice for Catwoman/Selina Kyle. I was concerned at his casting at the beginning, but then I was just as concerned when Ledger was announced as Joker and my fears were proved unjustified when I saw his final performance. Hathaway does just as well; a cool manipulatorshe's beautiful but her sexiness isn't flaunted as it was in Burton's BATMAN RETURNS. I've also come to appreciate the overall plot of the film as an excellent finish to the series. It touches back on elements introduced in the first two movies and ties everything together nicely; you might almost assume Nolan had this planned from the start. I'm pretty sure he didn't, but it worked out great. The end has been caused for endless debate and complaints but, as long as I view it as an isolated Batman tale set in Nolan's own universe with no long-standing effect on the future Batman movies, I'm cool with it. I actually think it's a perfect end for the story Nolan has been building since 2005."
"well, I saw batman last night and was rather underwhelmed really. despite having a natural dislike of Bales batman, I had high hopes for Nolans direction. I won't give away any spoilers, the trailers pretty much encapsulate the rather two dimensional plot entirely. Anne Hathaway was good, played her role better than any predecessor. I was hoping for a film with batman (after struggling to 'become' batman in the previous two films) would fulfil a more alpha role. tom hardy was better than expected, but I really did struggle to understand him sometimes. his character is supposed to be a tactical genius, as well as a superb fighter, and this didn't really come across. finally, you end up not caring about most of the cast as they are all 'damaged' and selfish. but most of all, batman seems rather desperate, and seemed to have shut down that big brain of his. not a spoiler - but there is also one scene that emulates perfectly all those YouTube Mick takes too, I actually laughed out loud as it were. the film wallows through its three long hours, I would cut it to two and a half. actually, the more I think about it, I realise there wasn't that much I enjoyed in the film! ah well, it didn't measure up to avengers or Prometheus, but it was better than the second bale batman offering (but not as good as the first - which was 'ok')."
"""The dark knight rises"" isn't the perfect film but it is definitely the most emotional of all three. Yeah i said it (but neither were the previous two). But i would be lying if i was telling you that i did not have goosebumps in numerous scenes or wet eyes during some of the most honestly acting (and touching) moments in the history of cinema. This time around, Bruce Wayne is being tested mentally and physically against Bane and his hordes for the salvation (or destruction) of Gotham city. However, what really works here and makes all the way through our heart and emotions are the sharply drawn and fleshed out characters. There will be people claiming that there is an large number of individuals that take lots of screen time, yet they actually feel and act as normal ""humans"" rather than archetypical Hollywood algorithms. Christian Bale should get a nomination for his work as Bruce Wayne. This is his finest Batman. You really root for him simply because like all of us, he has limits (spiritual and physical), limits that will be broken.

On the antagonist part, Tom Hardy as Bane is physically impressive. Make no mistake. This is not a well built body with perfect abs and biceps in order to lure teenage girls to the cinema. Instead Nolan's Bane is a colossal muscle mountain that could snap your spine in a split second without making the slightest of effort. Just like the edgy and twitchy Joker, his unique body language and swaggering mannerisms will certainly leave an impact to the viewer's mind and rightly to do so.

However, do i hear show stealer? Anne Hathaway - she is a fully lethal, sexy ass kicking babe. I cannot believe i am writing this but she was incredible! Of course she cannot fill Michelle Pfeiffer's (iconic) shoes simply because in the Tim Burtonland, Catwoman was a demented, emotionally scarred woman with certain supernatural status at the background and played more like a tragic villain. Here, Hathaway plays Selena Kyle as a sexy, independent, thief that is balancing between good and bad all the way through the film. A fitting antihero and blurred line between Batman's justice and Bane's menace. What i really enjoyed is how similar she looks, sounds, talks and moves like her counterpart in the animated series, comics and videogames. She is even waving that ass with a cat like pose. I absolutely loved this character!

The rest of the (multiple) cast are doing what they are doing best servicing the reliable (and sometimes surprising) story written by Nolan and Goyer. Both have done their homework with Nolan's direction becoming even more confident than before. His camera sweeps and embraces the vast cityscape of Gotham, day and (much more impressively) in the night. His exquisite taste for night time shots is something that deserves the IMAX ticket alone and brings back memories when Michael Mann used to be a cool director. But what about the script? How can a film surpass the heavy expectations of the Oscar worthy ""Dark knight""? Wel, it doesn't, but instead it goes around them. How do you follow that? You can't. Thus Nolan and co-s have done the wise decision of not repeating themselves terminating unwanted comparisons with the previous installments. The first entry was focused to the personal spiritual odyssey of a man and the second evolved into a crime thriller about masked vigilantes and themes of anarchy fused with (in)justice. On the other hand, the third chapter goes back to conclude the journey and the degenerated anarchy, brings back everything (and everyone) together and ties them nicely in the vast present of terrorism and economic prevalence (in a lesser degree). The Joker was full of surprises and meaningless through his performance reflecting the psychotic personality. Bane has a plan - to destroy Gotham city, to live in order to see its ashes. He doesn't want chaos, he wants order through chaos which is an interesting concept. The layout of anger, injustice, blurred morality (chase the Batman the vigilante or the robbers?) and motives is displayed through a complex array of events and almost possible situations (military law anyone?) that can be thought provoking and mind feeding.

Certain twists and turns do exist to maintain our thrilling interest to the sky but if you are a devoted Batman comic book guy, then you know kinda the story. ""The dark knight rises"" reaches superior film level status when it comes to powerful emotional scenes and outstanding sequences that will have your heart filled with grief and your sentiments exploding (for spoiler reasons i cannot mention any of these). The exceptional score by Hans Zimmer underlines and sometimes more than enough enhances the power of the unfolding events on screen into our mind. The A-class acting manages to inject real pathos and drama into the proceedings and this is what lacks from the movies nowdays. A good story, a fantastic cast and a large group of crew members that could make films like these possible. The movie is exceptionally shot, the action is plenty and more epic than before and the fight sequences between Batman and Bane are astonishing, especially their first encounter.

""The dark knight rises"" is an experience and should be seen in IMAX. There is ground here for even more psychological exploration and doubts about moral responsibilities that could reflect into our reality. This is a fitting and satisfying conclusion to the legend of the dark knight. Probably the world's best trilogy?"
"Not a bad movie but very disappointing if your expect a Batmanmovie...

We all know how ridiculous the first Batman movies where. But the where batman all over! Those movies where exactly how you portrait Batman. Yes they where 80's movies, over-acted and in many ways ridiculous... so? I loved them, because they where Batman!

The Dark Night started of great. A storyline what explained missing parts in the Batman legacy. Batman in this century. Great armor, wonderful costumes, perfect mood setting, grain and color...

I alway's thought Ledger was epic, but now we are making more of him than needed. And maybe that's where Nolan is making his first mistake... You simply can not top Ledgers apparency. You also can't top the clever designed toy's. It was good enough. all of it!

So if you make a third AND FINAL Batman movie... go out with a BANG!

That didn't happen.

It didn't even felt like Batman at all...

An empty feeling after leaving the cinema. Mostly because you know it will take 20 years from now somebody will try it again. So this is it. This is Batman 2000."
"Going out with a bang doesn't even begin to describe ""The Dark Knight Rises"", the final installment of Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. The film runs over 2 hours and 30 minutes but keeps you interested at all times (the main problem I had with the otherwise excellent ""The Dark Knight"" was that its pacing felt uneven and it got a little boring at times) and keeps upping the tension every minute leading up to what is indeed an epic conclusion. The film picks up eight years after ""the Dark Knight"", with the city of Gotham almost crime-free due to Batman taking the blame for the death of Harvey Dent. But it turns out to be the calm before the biggest threat Gotham has ever faced  a revolution led by the menacing Bane (Tom Hardy) and his henchmen. Meanwhile Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) has retired from the public eye with only his butler Alfred (Michael Caine) to keep him company. However, a mysterious criminal named Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) and threat of Gotham's destruction makes him rise from the shadows again. Christian Bale, Michael Caine and the other actors (Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and Liam Neeson) who previously appeared in the series reprise their roles with ease and seem to push their acting to the very limit since it's the last installment. Especially Bale and Oldman have never been better in their roles. But it's the new additions to the cast that really lifts this movie to a higher level. Hathaway, whose casting I definitely had some doubts about, plays Selina/Catwoman perfectly  an extraordinary mix of strength and vulnerability. Marion Cotillard in the other ""love interest"" role blows previous Batman paramours Maggie Gyllenhaal and Katie Holmes out of the water. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is also wonderful as John Blake, a policeman with strong beliefs. But it's Tom Hardy as Bane that really made the film for me. Not only is he truly terrifying at times, but he also manages to make the character sympathetic and complex. But the true star of the film is director (and co-screenwriter) Cristopher Nolan. As a previous fan of his work I was looking forward to this film with very high expectations and some fear that it wouldn't live up to the hype. My expectations were not matched  they were exceeded. The depth of the story was immense; it provoked lots of thoughts about society and our values and had a huge emotional impact on me. Credit for the cinematographer, the composer (Hans Zimmer truly is the greatest composer of today) and the special effects team is also due. Never have I ever felt as truly satisfied with every aspect of a film as I did with this one. So to summarize ""The Dark Knight Rises"" it is one of the best films I have ever seen and the absolute best one in the trilogy. It makes almost all other films pale in comparison to its grandeur and even if it won't be the box office winner of the year (which it very well may be) it's going to be a classic for years to come. As I try to describe how great it was I realize that it isn't possible  because it was so much more than great. This is a movie isn't just a movie. It's a future legend."
"I just saw TDKR in IMAX with my Mom, and I have just one word for it... WHOA! I was really impressed with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, but this one... I'm sorry but I'm still in awe of this movie. The best Batman movie I've ever seen, and maybe the best MOVIE I've ever seen. Since the final scene in The Dark Knight when Batman is riding the Bat-Pod and disappears into downtown Gotham, I've been waiting four years to see what direction Christopher Nolan and the rest of the crew and cast would take. Now that we've finally reached the release of ""The Dark Knight Rises"", I'm extremely happy to say that I was completely blown away by this movie. Usually threequels tend not to do so good, but this is one of the few that are outstanding!

Story (No spoilers): 8 years have passed since the Joker's rampage, and Batman has not been seen since he has taken the fall for Harvey Dent/Two-Face's crimes. Bruce Wayne is now a recluse, and is clearly emotionally damaged by his experiences as Batman, and his loss of his childhood sweetheart Rachel Dawes. The crime rate in Gotham City has quieted down, but that peacetime is short lived when a new threat arrives. A threat even worse than what the Joker had in store for Gotham... BANE. Batman is then forced to come out of hiding to stop Bane's reign of terror.

The acting as always is top notch: Christian Bale is an excellent and believable Batman/Bruce Wayne, and accurately shows the complexity of the character. This is probably his best portrayal of Bruce Wayne since we get a really good insight on Bruce Wayne much like the insight we got on Peter Parker in Spider-Man 2, and how Bruce must rise above his personal demons once again and become Batman in his heart and mind. Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle/Catwoman really surprised me. I loved her performances in some of her other movies, but this performance is probably her best yet! She is the best Catwoman ever put on screen! Tom Hardy as Bane, while he may not be as interesting as the Joker he's still an awesome villain. Tom Hardy's performance as Bane is phenomenal, and he is one of the most exciting and most terrifying villain I've ever seen. He's physically superior to Batman which is shown in the first confrontation between the two characters, which was so intense by the way. I like how his physical appearance was changed for this movie because the expressions in his eyes makes him more intimidating. And yes his voice was much more easier to understand this time, even though there are times you may not clearly understand what he said. Plus, Tom Hardy's Bane made me forget all about Joel Schumacher's version of Bane in ""Batman and Robin"", and that's saying something. As for the rest of the cast, Michael Caine (he got me teary eyed a few times in this one), Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Marion Cotilliard and Joseph Gordon-Levitt (awesome as usual, and his character has a surprising story arc at the end) are fantastic in their roles. Heck, anyone who had a small part or anyone who was an extra should be proud that they were even in this movie! Lastly the directing: Christopher Nolan has done such a superb job with telling his story of Batman, and I congratulate him for making a trilogy that is probably the best I've ever seen.

The moment this movie started, I was completely drawn into it from beginning to the end, as was everybody else in the theater. No spoilers, but there were twists and turns that I didn't expect to happen, some scenes with funny lines (especially some of the scenes between Lucius Fox and Bruce Wayne, and between Bruce Wayne/Batman and Selina Kyle/Catwoman) and yes some romance. And the way the film ends (without spoiling anything) was perfect. All the loose ends that were open throughout the trilogy were wrapped up so nicely.

The visual effects once again were amazing and I liked the scene at the football stadium. The music by Hans Zimmer is mind blowing, and I don't think you could come up with a better score for Batman than this! And I also love the look of Gotham City in this one. Unlike the last two films which were filmed in Chicago, most of it this time was filmed in NYC, and some of the shots were filmed in Los Angeles and Pittsburgh. Plus I was able to pick out a few spots obviously since most of this was filmed in NYC, since my family is from NYC.

This trilogy once again is probably the best that I've ever seen, and it's definitely the kind of trilogy we'll be telling our kids about in 20 years time much like our parents told us about Star Wars. These three movies have given me such great experiences and memories that I will remember forever, and I'm absolutely going to miss the hype that comes with waiting for Nolan's next Batman, but I think he's right when he says it's time for the story to come to an end. I'm not kidding when I say this: Check this one out because, you're in for one hell of a ride!

(This is in light of the tragic shooting in Colorado: may God take care of the victims that are now with Him, the families of those who were killed and may He help the family of the shooter get through this terrible ordeal he's put them through.)

Update: I still think this film is great, and I don't really see any problems or plot holes like people keep insisting there is. This was a solid ending to the trilogy and nothing more."
"Questions were asked from this film even before its conception ? Can it match its predecessor? Well the answer is, It has passed its predecessor. Nolan has outdone again this time there was no anarchy in streets of Gotham but a revolution. The fight will always remain between good and bad but the players here were ordinary citizen. Hardy made Bane look like a fanatic catching its essence and its revolt. Hathway was not only sexy but also stellar. This time there was no mighty Batman but Nolan shows the man behind the mask who can fail and also can RISE.You have to see it twice not because there is no sequel for it"
"In 2005 Christopher Nolan gave us Batman Begins, a near-perfect film detailing the story of Bruce Wayne and his journey to becoming Batman. This film brought Batman out from the depths of movie hell, there courtesy of Joel Schumacher's appalling Batman Forever and Batman & Robin, which turned Batman into a joke who no one would want to touch with 10-foot pole. Thankfully Nolan was brave enough to resurrect him in 2005, and in 2008 we got The Dark Knight, a film which turned what we knew about blockbusters and superhero flicks upside-down. With a phenomenal performance by Heath Ledger and an even darker journey into Gotham City this was a perfect film.

Now, after four years, Nolan concludes his epic trilogy with The Dark Knight Rises. There is no denying the hype for this movie is huge, people are bound to be disappointed, fans divided and angry, but when after I finished watching this (after having attended a back-to-back trilogy screening on an IMAX screen) I realised just how fitting this movie was. These aren't simple superhero movies with loud noises and non-stop action, he has imbued each character with true personalities and the story with multiple themes. Bruce Wayne became Batman in the beginning, fell into dark times in the middle and rose to become Gotham's hero in the end. Emotions run high in this final installment as Batman comes out of hiding to face a truly menacing villain along with the people close to him.

Eight years after the events of The Dark Knight Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) is in hiding and his corporation is going broke, but the emergence of Bane (Tom Hardy), a mercenary with a dark past out for trouble, and Selina Kyle/Catwoman (Anne Hathaway) bring Wayne out of retirement. Now Batman, along with up and coming Detective Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman), Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), Alfred (Michael Caine) and newcomer millionaire Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard) must try and save Gotham from Bane and his mercenaries.

Where do I start with reviewing this movie? There is much to say and an unfortunate limit on my word count so I will be brief. The acting is outstanding from each cast member, Bale has been so good as Wayne/Batman and he completes his character arc with raw emotion. Hardy is exceptional as Bane, physically intimidating and always a scene-stealer, most of the film's best scenes involve Bane addressing a large crowd or brutalising anyone in his way. Hathaway does well as Catwoman, neither hero or villain she is a complex character who I wish we saw more of. Of course Oldman, Cotillard and Freeman are excellent, but I must mention Michael Caine who really shone in this film, delivering an award-worthy final turn as everyone's favourite butler. Finally Joseph Gordon-Levitt is proving again and again he is becoming one of the best actors of our time, he does a fantastic job as the optimistic detective who never loses hope.

Nolan's direction is perfect and his script (co-written with his brother Jonathon) is an emotional roller-coaster packed with some truly breathtaking action set-pieces filmed in glorious IMAX. Cities crumble, bridges collapse and civil wars are fought and look fantastic, thank you Nolan for not shooting in 3D! Hans Zimmer's score suits the tone of the film well, the now very well known chant is used to good effect in a pivotal scene towards the end.

This is a truly cinematic experience, expertly blending the action genre with drama, creating a fitting final act to Nolan's Batman trilogy. I may seem to be heaping too much praise on this movie, but really, it deserves it, it is engrossing and quite simply one of the best films I've seen in a long, long time. Nolan's Batman trilogy is possibly one of the greatest conceived and it will be a long time before a superhero movie of this calibre will be made.

10/10"
"Disappointed as a viewer. The worst thing a film can do it to make the viewer step out of the film and say ""Give me a break"" If the film interrupts the viewing, it is flawed.

Give me a break. Detonation of an atomic bomb off the coast of Gotham? The aftermath: Huge waves, devastation to the city. Radiation fall out for years. The suggestion that Batman is alive is also absurd. He had 5 seconds to detonation and had not dropped the bomb. NO WAY he could have reached any kind of escape velocity. And if his BAT vehicle submerged, which I doubt it did. He could not have survived the radioactivity and heat generated by the blast. This is just stupid writing. The film makers should have resorted to another scenario.

Next, the entire police force crowded together in a massive mob heading toward city hall. That is just stupid. It may have worked in an old 1930s movie where UNION workers confronted private police and then fought it out with CLUBS, but to walk into a direct assault of canons? Have we learned nothing since the CIVIL WAR. Battles are not fought that way anymore. The police would have spread out, infiltrated the city hall via underground passages, used ropes to repel from buildings, and overwhelmed the bad guys, not walk in to certain death. The entire attack on city hall was plain stupid. Another example of pulling the viewer out of the film and making him say ""What the Hell?"".

In fact, the movie should have been called BATMAN and CATWOMAN. Ann Hathaway was an equal to the Dark Knight and I might say did more to save the city that he did.

BANE was a bad dude, psychotic and menacing, but his mask was his Achilles heel. It was much too vulnerable and as such was a stupid idea. If the mask was controlling his pain, he needed to have it protected. All of the punches to his face would have been more than enough to disable this Darth Vader Wannabe. I did like the use of the Sean Connery voice. It added a bit of class the the maniac's demeanor.

Also, having a Mideastern villain wanting revenge on Gotham? Old news since 911. Not very original.

The film does show how vulnerable modern cities are to terrorism, but DUH! that Old news as well.

Bottom Line. Too many flaws in logic and writing for me to really enjoy the film."
"Well, let's be honest. Heath Ledger played the Joker in the Dark Knight and we all know that he could not be topped. But Tom Hardy did a great job as the villain and the special effects helped. I personally think the Dark Knight was better than this one but not by much. Out of a scaled of 10, Dark knight was 20/10, it was better than perfect, and this new movie is a 10/10, still perfect. When I say that the dark knight is better that doesn't mean that I am saying the dark knight rises was worse.

The way the story develops, and the way it comes together is amazing. Christopher Nolan cannot disappoint, and if you are thinking about watching this movie, you are making a mistake. Don't think, just do (like the joker).

I also would like to spread out my condolences to the families of the victims of the shooting in Aurora. Please remember that the shooting has nothing to deal directly with the movie, so do not be scared. Enjoy the time you have. :)"
"As the film starts, it goes to the six minute prologue. You are left sitting there thinking you are in for a treat. And you would be right, for the last hour and 15 minutes. The next scene is at Wayne manor with Gordon saying his speech, and you think, this is just a boring scene, and will get better, but not for at least an hour and a half. The film is very enjoyably, and does not feel overlong, but starts of bad. It is a brilliant film, which was to be expected from the brilliant director, Christopher Nolan, just not as good as the dark knight, which no one expected it to be. I still highly recommend this film, just don't expect it to be the new shawshank redemption."
"This movie is deceptively amazing... the beginning starts off slow (so you think), then it get amazing... then better... then EVEN better. until the end where EVERYTHING comes together and you mind is blown into tiny batman shaped pieces. it leaves you speechless. Its beautiful, stunning, shocking, amazing. and props to the guy who wrote the music... cause that is some VERY good music right there. :) Christian Bale is the best Batman and you get too peer into Bruce Waynes ideals and what he is truly made of. not batman... but Bruce Wayne. Anne Hathoway is perfect Catwoman who is sly, sexy, and utterly awesome. Lastly, Tom Hardy is a perfect evil mastermind with a twist. he gives Bane life and emotions and an overall shockingly good portrayal of bane. And what a great twist in the movie. i NEVER saw it coming. go see the Dark Knight Rises NOW."
"The Dark Knight Rises is one of those rare films that you want to continue longer than its run time. The film is mind-blowingly awesome and I feel that the movie is immensely better than its predecessors. Why?

Well, for one, it has outstanding performances by each and every cast member and not once did I feel the acting to be corny or lame. The real standouts were, of course, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, and Tom Hardy. Bale returns to take up the mantle of Batman once again and he doesn't disappoint in any way. His butler Alfred also made this movie great because Michael Caine is such a fine actor who can really evoke your emotions. Tom Hardy's performance as Bane is indescribable. It is just so good. We all expect Bane to be ruthless,and he is, but he is also very smart and sophisticated. He is no shape or form similar in any way to the piece of sh*t Bane from Batman and Robin. That Bane was just a vomit-inducing dumbass. I consider Hardy to give the finest performance in the film. You just have to see him on screen. Anne Hathaway, Morgan Freeman, and the rest were also great in the film.

Secondly, the action along with the score make TDKR a film to watch. Batman is back after 8 years and he has a new vehicle at his disposal. The Bat-copter accounts for some action scenes in the film and it plays a crucial part in the story. Bane's physique, strength, and fighting skills are better than Batman's and the fighting scenes between them two makes you want to stand up and cheer. The score and soundtrack also alleviate the action and give the fight scenes a sense of epicness. We have Hans Zimmer to thank for that. Overall, the film's score makes every scene more better.

Finally, the story is very interesting and never becomes boring or makes you want the film to skip to the fighting already. Batman has to come out of his hiatus and take on Bane who is terrorizing Gotham City. The film cleverly explores Bane's background in order to give the reader a reason as to what causes him to become the madman that he is. Not everything is what it seems. I won't go into too much because I don't want to spoil anything.

I did have one issue with the film though. Bane's mask makes it hard to clearly understand what he is saying and a couple of times I had to ask my brother next to me what Bane just said. Even my brother didn't have a clue.

Anyway, I really enjoyed the film and I consider it to be one of the best superhero films made, even better than the Avengers - which I really liked.

'Over and Out.' 22nd of July, 2012."
"Watched it first day, first show. I'm a huge fan of the series so was going to watch it anyway, whether it was good or bad because generally the conclusion of any epic series isn't that satisfying. But....we forget it's Christopher Nolan who has directed this. I was actually speechless for a long time after the movie finished. It's PHENOMENAL!!!

It's worth every dime of your money and time spent (it's a long movie). It's full of stupefying, yet sensible, action, with an addition to Batman's armada of stunning vehicles. There are many twists and turns which keeps even the most seasoned of the audience guessing till a long time. All the acting is genuine (no question there!), the cinematography is bold and raw. Catwoman steals the hearts. And Bane, oh.. He is so bad and so tough! The direction is, as always, brilliant. In fact, Christopher Nolan has given everything he's got to this finale. It's dark, we can emotionally attach to, and feel, every situation and along with all this I would like to make the special mention of the music, the background score, by Hans Zimmer. I wouldn't be wrong in saying that this film wouldn't have got this legendary aura to it without the background music!

So, in short, whether you've watched earlier parts or not, it's an at least a must watch movie, three times!"
"This is my first review I want it to be simple TDKR is an epic conclusion to any superhero movie ever seen its lengthy and dark because of pressure of previous blockbuster TDK it builds up its story slowly n deserves multiple viewings to clarify every aspect its not fast paced as TDK but it is just like begins in terms of story telling and it is superior to every other super hero movies because it delivers what it promises and this is satisfying ending it doesn't leaves you frustrated TDKR completes on the great trilogies in movie history. Finally, I would like to thank Christopher Nolan for portraying Batman in a way no one ever thought was possible and for making one the best trilogy of all time."
"When Batman begins first came out I wasn't sure how you could do any better than the first Michael Keaton film. How wrong I was! Nolan has done a fantastic job reinventing the series, The sequel was almost as good as the first and gave us an outstanding performance from Heath Ledger which will always be remembered. So he had to get it right again and once again he does not disappoint.

There was always a worry for me that putting Catwoman into a comic book film that Nolan has really tried to keep as realistic as possible would add a camp over the top element to it but Anne Hathaway played it brilliantly and looked stunning in the tight leather outfit, I would have said cat suit but it's only hinted as one with a clever use of glasses for ears.

Tom Hardy was great as ever, he even managed to show his emotions through a thick mask. Once again another incredibly memorable bad guy has been brought to us. My only criticisms would be that occasionally it was difficult to understand what he was saying, I found myself having to really concentrate hard to follow the dialogue. Also without giving anything away he goes from a menacing, very intelligent force to be reckoned with that was always one step ahead of everyone, to a basic vulnerable thug quite quickly and I feel such a great character deserved a better finale.

I also found that if I thought too hard about what the overall logic behind the city destruction plan was there were several plot holes.....but this is not based on a true story and there was nothing too obvious to take you out of the action so it really didn't matter too much.

The film is quite long but moves at a relentless pace, with Hanz Zimmers pounding soundtrack to keep us gripped along with some incredible action scenes, sit back, switch off and let Bane and Batmans clash unfold in a nicely wrapped up ending to a fantastic trilogy, it's just a shame it's all over."
"I have always been a massive fan of the Batman comics, ever since I was a child I was asking for the Batmobile for Christmas, and even though it's terrible I'm still a fan of the Tim Burton reboot. (Now you really know I'm a die-hard fan) But with all that said, there was something about The Dark Knight Rises that didn't feel right to me.

Having seen it 4 times now I feel like I have a strong grasp on the entire film, and there are definitely some flaws that need pointing out, even though the majority of the film did leave me in awe. First of all I want to say that out of the trilogy; Batman Begins is my favourite. I love The Dark Knight, but it almost feels like 'filler' between Batman Begins and Dark Knight Rises, in that there's no real story to it, it's just what Batman did for about a month that lead to Rachel dying. I loved Batman Begins because although it showed Bruce over a long period of time, it didn't really miss out any details. There were no stones left unturned, every story arc had an ending, every Christopher Nolan placed cheesy joke had it's minute, and even the ending wasn't as clichéd as it sounds on paper, even if I do hate it for making me wait 3 years to meet the Joker. But with all the hype leading up to 'Rises, I feel like an unobtainable greatness was expected by me and a lot of other fans, and so it would always seem worse than the previous two. That's nothing against Nolan though, 'Rises is a fantastic film that I thoroughly enjoyed, but the only ending to a trilogy I have ever fully appreciated was Return of the King, but that's because it's such a masterpiece that the earlier films were dwarfed in comparison. So based on that 'Rises was destined to fail in my eyes.

That said, there were still parts of 'Rises that are truly awesome. Bane, for instance, is one of the best villains I have seen in any film, game, book, TV show, advert, comic or dental commercial ever. He's just so bad-ass, even with the ridiculous voice and perfectly smooth head; Tom Hardy manages to present this 'don' of a character that even Samurai-flipping-Jack would be frightened of, and he does it all with the majority of his face covered up. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman also deserves much credit. The 'Halle Berry Catwoman' was bitter sweet for me and much of the DC fan base, it no-doubt was a very, very poor film, but it was sexy as hell, and this is where I saw Anne Hathaway going wrong; I thought she'd try too hard to make a better character than Berry and end up making a Catwoman that pasty teenagers around the globe couldn't ""enjoy"". But rest assured universe; she ticked both boxes. Hathaway ended up creating a character with such a sense of mystique around her that I think we all ended up wanting her to have more screen time, just so we could work her out, well that and her uh..'delectable posterior' (to put it nicely). On top of that, there are so many moments in this film that have you on the edge of your seat, making involuntary ""phwwoaaaaarrr""-like noises. The bat-pods, for instance, are so much cooler than ever before, with the rolling-sideways-wheels and smashing into and through buildings. The collection of all 5 tumblers also had me giggling like a little girl, and even the small references to 'Killer Croc' made me grin uncontrollably.

There are, however, some faults with The Dark Knight Rises that I feel need to be covered. A couple of them are just nit-picking; such as how in hell didn't the football player realise the ground had collapsed behind him? and how did Batman survive the nuclear blast if two seconds from detonation we saw him pushing the throttle forward?! Even if he had ejected immediately after he would have been able to avoid the blast radius. Some of the faults are more substantial though. For example I feel like bringing Ra's Al Ghul back into the picture with his daughter ruined things a tad, having Bane, the man exiled from the league of shadows for being too extreme is enough I think, as they don't really deal with Talia after she escapes, they just kill Bane and dispose of the bomb. Secondly, I feel there were a few too many plot twists for the story to flow properly, I mean come on Nolan; It's the end of the best Batman trilogy ever made; you don't have to keep throwing in changes to make sure we don't get bored. Hell, the majority of us are going to love it even if it's awful.

Overall though it's extremely important to remember that this movie is the 'cat's pyjamas', and will probably go in for an Oscar or two if the academy don't act like idiots (again). Bane is one of the best written, most quotable character's of any film I've ever seen, and Bale really comes into his own as both Batman and Bruce in this third and final instalment (he tones down the Batman grumble, and doesn't make Bruce look like such a pansy anymore). So really disregard what I've said above, it's a fantastic film and I'm sure it will be a lot of people's favourite of the trilogy, just not mine. Go out and make your own opinion on it, because it's another of these films that come around once in a while where a review or general rating isn't able to truly determine how great it really is. (9/10)"
"I was really excited to see this movie, more so than any other movie this summer. After watching it this afternoon, I have to say I was underwhelmed. While I thought the cinematography was quite dramatic, with Pittsburgh and Jodhpur, India providing dramatic scenery, some of the story lines fell flat. Comparing this film the Nolan's last two films, the Dark Knight and Inception, it feels like the story just wasn't as well written. The twists we're OK, nothing mindblowing, and there were a few holes in the plot. But I think it really just came down to the Villains in the movie. What made Dark Knight so great was that The Joker was such a great character. Bane? Not so much. He was strong and punched hard, but wasn't quite evil enough. I expected more."
"I'm from the Netherlands and we Dutch people are quite down-to-earth. If we watch a comedy we nod approvingly if a joke is funny, if we're watching a drama we nod disapprovingly if something bad happens. In short, Dutch people aren't generally very enthusiastic. At the end of the Dark Knight Rises, however, there was applause. No kidding, actual applause. I had never seen this happen, ever. And it's not undeserved, because this is one amazing piece of cinema.

There might be some minor flaws in this film. Bane's voice sounded a bit odd at times, for instance. But then, no good movie is without mistakes. There's Pterodactyls in Citizen Kane, for god's sake! Look over the movies slight flaws and there's an amazing film underneath.

The story is compelling and much less ""superhero"" than the other two. Sure, you still have the typical comic-book characters. But the story's focus on the people behind those masks creates a much more realistic and emotionally compelling movie. And the movie achieves this without going too far away from the Batman's comic-book roots.

But there's another reason why this movie is such a great film. It complete's the trilogy. It rarely happens that movies based on comic-books contain an actual ending. This movie does, taking all the threads from the three movies and wrapping them up in a neat bundle.

In conclusion, it might be an unpopular opinion, but I find this to be the best Batman movie, ever."
"I have just seen this movie and was deeply disappointed. I think this is the worst movie I have seen in years. I really liked the previous film ""The dark knight"" with Heath Ledger in a fantastic role as the joker, but this film !? Why not rename it ""The dark knight s"". The messy plot, all the logical faults, the soft comments where to sacrifice oneself for the city of Gotham, the tears, the worn out wisdom of the wise-man in the cave. I suspect a ""we're only in it for the money"" attitude for the creators of this film, but then again it looks as if they tried but failed, and an expensive film to make it must have been. Why not use some of that money on an intelligent plot. Instead of this mess. Just forget this movie and save your money, and your time."
"I went to see the midnight showing that had the longest line for a film I've ever seen, and The Dark Knight Rises was beyond well worth the time I waited in line which was nearly three hours. The Dark Knight Rises is an achievement of film that hasn't been done in well in film in years and you will be reminded of great films like back to films like Lawrence of Arabia, Ben-Hur and Seven Samurai in their story, message, grandeur and scope. It's a rarity to see a film attempt it now days let alone be successful, and The Dark Knight Rises it that kind of film that everyone should see. The film is more than an event film or summer movie. The Dark Knight Rises is simply one of the best movies of all time.

I've never been a big fan of DC comics never really getting into or finding a connection with their characters, but Batman was the exception. I loved the dark tone of the comic and the villains along with the more adult story lines it became one of my favorite comics outside of Spiderman, and the X-Men. Since Batman's conception in 1939 Batman has become one of the oldest comic book characters and one of the most popular, and there have been many TV and film adaptations, and most of them I've seen have been surprisingly good. From Adam West's fun but campy late 1960's version to Super Friends, to the best television Batman in Batman: The Animated Series, to Batman and Batman Begins and Batman: Mask of the Phantasm. There have been many different takes on Batman, but Christopher Nolan's is the best surpassing my favorite Batman film Mask of the Phantasm. What Nolan has achieved here with the Dark Knight Rises and his trilogy of films is truly something special, but I get to that and the director later.

As for The Dark Knight Rises let me get to what I like first, which was everything. I'll address some of the issues some of the critics had later. The story I can't go into too much detail, because it will give away some plot points and there are a few brilliant twists in the movie including the amazing and satisfying ending. The Dark Knight Rises takes place eight years after the end of The Dark Knight. The crime in Gotham has gone way done, because of the Dent Act, which gave more power to the police. Bruce Wayne has disappeared from the public eye hiding in his mansion as a recluse living in his self-pity. He's brought out of his hiding by Selina Kyle and a mysterious Bane who brings death and destruction everywhere he goes. There really isn't much mention to The Dark Knight in the plot of the film or the Joker, and you won't notice that. The Dark Knight Rises does have many connections to Batman begins as Batman's story comes full circle. I'll stop here before I give anything away. I will say that the plot written by Christopher and Jonathan Nolan is well written in story, pace and tone.

Michael Caine is truly a superb actor and he truly wait he had better get a supporting Oscar for this film and he should win it. He is superb as Alfred and has been in the previous two films. Bring such emotion and humor as Bruce's butler, father figure and friend. He wants the best for Bruce just like any parent wants the best for their children. Another old timer who steals many of the scenes of the film is the great Gary Oldman as James Gordon. I again think he should at very least be nominated for supporting actor. Christian Bale again does great job as Bruce Wayne and a good job as Batman. Unlike the other actors who've taken on the role I think he's done the best job getting into the mind of Bruce Wayne and totally embodying the character. There are many new comers to the film. I like I think many people were a little worried about Bain played by Tom Hardy. Tom did a great job. I know people want to compare Bane to the Joker and Heath Ledger, so I will. Tom Hardy made a more vicious bad guy, but is less charismatic, which Ledger embodied in the Joker. They are two different types of villains. I wasn't as upset like most after seeing the Catwoman suit months ago. I was more upset that Anne Hathaway was cast for the part. I thought she was an overrated actress, plus I was honestly hoping for a hotter actress. My doubts were alleviated as the film drew closer and I saw that she could fill out a cat suit. Out of all the new comers to this film series I think she might have done the best job. She brought sexiness and emotion to the character and to be honest I thought she's a better Catwoman then Michelle Pheiffer. Next is Joseph Gordon-Levitt as John Blake.

I don't know why IMDb doesn't let you post reviews with more then a thousand words. Anyway you can see the rest of my review at Movieweb.com under Huntsman."
"If there was anyone who could top 'The Dark Knight', it would have to be Christopher Nolan himself. It's no small feat even for the masterful director - not least for the fact that it would have been difficult to construct a villain as perfect as the late Heath Ledger's Joker – but fans who ever doubted if Nolan would be able to pull it off can now rest easy. Not only is the answer to that question an affirmative yes, Nolan closes quite possibly the very best comic-book adaptation ever with a heart-stopping bang, once and for all putting his stamp on the Batman legend with a viscerally thrilling and emotionally gripping conclusion.

Familiarity with the Gotham universe and the Bruce Wayne/ Batman character that Nolan had built over the course of 'Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight' is a must if one were to truly appreciate and admire the subtleties, nuances and brilliance of this trilogy capper.

Opening eight years after Batman disappeared into the shadows carrying the burden of District Attorney Harvey Dent's murder, Nolan and his co- screenwriter Johnathan Nolan paint a Gotham still living a lie. While Dent's legacy has assisted the city to lock up its criminals without trial, the seeds of criminalism are evident- after all, Gotham has once again been divided by class, with the wealthy controlling the institutions of power and the poor forced to grovel in the sewers. Those who recall 'Batman Begins' will certainly draw the parallels with Gotham before Batman's appearance, the very societal malaise perfect fodder for Ra's al Ghul and his League of Shadows' plan of destruction then.

Of course, the similarities are no coincidence- Batman's adversary here is the vicious mercenary Bane (Tom Hardy), who was a student of the League of Shadows before he was ex-communicated from the organisation for being even too extremist for them. Sure, Bane may not be as familiar a villain within the Batman universe as the Joker, but a sensationally exhilarating mid-air hijack sequence will soon demonstrate that Bane isn't kidding when he proclaims himself as 'Gotham's reckoning'. Not only an intellectual equal to Batman, Bane is also physically superior, especially given Bruce's poor state of health following his self-imposed seclusion in the eight years that have followed.

Bane's strategy of upending the class inequality will intrigue and delight the more cerebral viewers, while his physicality will excite the adrenaline-driven (and predominantly male) viewer looking for some good- old mano-a-mano action goodness. Herein lies the genius of Nolan's films- built as they may be for blockbuster spectacle, they have always had an intellectual slant. The realities of our capitalist societies have been distilled and crystallised into that of Gotham, and the triggers of class warfare laid bare for our reflection.

Even as it feels expansive in scope, Nolan never loses sight of his titular character. This is by far his most intimate take on Bruce Wayne/ Batman, returning full circle to examine Wayne's motivations for adopting the alter-ego in the first place as well as his inner demons. In particular, Nolan reinforces the relationship between Batman and his two guardians- the loyal Wayne family butler Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Caine) and the equally loyal Wayne Enterprises employee Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman).

Besides casting light on Wayne's troubled soul, Nolan also delves once again into the core of the Batman legend. He established Batman as a symbol of hope and justice before, and here he powerfully reaffirms that notion of the caped crusader as a beacon of promise and perseverance amidst a fallen world. 'The Batman can be anyone', says Bruce Wayne in the movie- and Nolan leaves that statement ringing in your mind with a franchise feeder of an ending and a nifty twist to one of the key new characters he adds.

Whether returning or new characters, all but Anne Hathaway have worked with Nolan previously, and every one of these fine actors are in top form here. Hathaway's zestful performance brings some welcome levity into the otherwise grim and brooding proceedings, and Levitt perfectly embodies the balance of optimism and pragmatism of his character. As Bane, Tom Hardy is unfortunately saddled with the bane (pun intended) of following in the shoes of Heath Ledger- and though he never manages to make his character quite as iconic, he is nevertheless a fearsome and formidable physical presence on screen. Veteran actors Gary Oldman (as Commissioner Gordon), Freeman and Caine are excellent as always, but it is Bale who carries the show with a thoroughly committed, haunting and hypnotic portrayal of Bruce Wayne.

Mesmerising too is Nolan's handling of the action scenes in the movie, most of which are filmed with IMAX cameras and look absolutely stunning in the format. From the opening skyjacking to blowing up a football field in the middle of a packed stadium to a daring mid-day raid on the Stock Exchange, Nolan spares nothing in ensuring that the action is consistently riveting. It is also never less than realistic, a quality that Nolan has managed to sustain through every one of his Batman films. And together with his regular d.p. Wally Pfister, Nolan creates a scarily authentic portrait of urban warfare complete with the collapse of physical and social structures.

Indeed, as one looks back at Nolan's trilogy, one can only marvel at how he has managed to make the Batman universe so relevant and prescient to our real world. Unlike the Marvel movies which has kept the comic book universe intact while injecting real-world elements, Nolan has so beautifully integrated the twin universes together, sacrificing neither the legend from the books nor the realities of today's society. 'The Dark Knight Rises' is an epic conclusion all right, packed with action, emotion, depth and symbolism, and a must-see simply because it is one of the very best films of the year."
"I saw ""The Dark Knight Rises"" yesterday evening and it completely exceeded my every expectation. When i first saw ""Begins"" i thought that it took the comic book films to a different level thanks to the believability and sincerity of the characters it portrayed. ""Rises"" continues this line which was set by the first movie and followed by ""The Dark Knight"".

The cast couldn't have been more perfect. Bale as Batman is able to give genuine emotion and bitterness following the losses he has suffered. He is not just another hero, he has been scarred by the events come to pass and knows that just putting up the mask again is not going to be enough.

Bane, played by Tom Hardy, stole the show for me. I was pleased that a new kind of villain was introduced. In the first movie, Scarecrow and Ra's Al Ghul relied on the terror of fear implanted in peoples minds, in the second one, Joker unleashed uncontrollable chaos and in the third one Bane is a brutal menace, who breaks down Batman and, by his words ""liberates people from the oppressive corruption Gotham endures"". Tom Hardy did remarkably well by creating Bane as someone terrifying simply by using his voice and eyes.

I was also glad to see that Joseph Gordon-Levitt had a great role following his ""Inception"" one. He plays a different kind of hero and this performance definitely feels like he will have a lot that comes in his way in next years. Anne Hathaway was also phenomenal as Selina Kyle. She had the main female part and did an excellent and believable job.

The rest of the supporting cast consisted of great actors and actresses too. Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Marion Cotillard and Gary Oldman were all marvelous in their respective roles. The chemistry between the whole cast was amazing, maybe it's the main reason why Nolan has included them in most of his films too.

Other aspects of the film were completely mind-blowing. Hans Zimmer wrote score of immense atmosphere, the scale of action scenes was extraordinary and cinematography beyond ones imagination. Dialogue was smart and really gave life to the characters.

In conclusion, i have to say that the Batman trilogy Nolan has created is one of my favorites and ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a worthy final chapter to it. Everything about this movie is shear perfect."
"This, in a word, was a masterpiece. It completely wrapped up the loose ends of Nolan's Batman movies in an extremely satisfying and epic way, while still leaving it open in a way. The acting was top notch, Tom Hardy did a phenomenal job as Bane.Bane was an excellent villain. He was hard and menacing yet much more human than the Joker, and one scene in particular you see Bane is still has a little bit of a soft side. The effects and cinematography were just what you'd expect, perfect. I honestly don't have any complaints with this film. It was everything I hoped for, and made this, in my mind, on of the greatest trilogy of all time. The movie was paced just write slowly building to a edge of the seat peak, and the end left a smile on your face. It was perfect 10/10."
"There were a lot of batman movies, but none of them could meet the expectations created by the comics, with ""batman & Robin"" being one of the most horrible movies I've ever seen! Then Nolan came along with a bunch of masterpieces behind him, and then created two astounding batman films within a span of 3 years! And now, he has concluded, which to me is one of the best trilogies ever, in an epic and a heart-stopping way! As they say 'THE LEGEND ENDS, BUT THE LEGACY CONTINUES'............!!!

Its hard to compare this and TDK, both of them are amusing in their own prospective. TDK was run mainly by joker, aka heath ledger, and this was clearly batman's show. I can't imagine a perfect way to end the trilogy. And Nolan did an amazing job in maintaining the fire created by TDK, clearly stating that he is one of the best in his genre.

The action sequences were pretty amazing so was the background music. There is a reason why Nolan retained the same cast for all the movies, and they did it professionally.

It was one hell of a ride for me, and gave me goosebumps throughout. Being a batman fan, I loved all the 3 movies, and just like the other two movies, I rate it 10/10. Don't miss it guys, besides you have got to see the 'legend end'."
"This movie is AMAZING! I am planning on watching it on the opening day again after I watched the Premiere. The conclusion of the Dark Night sequel is perfect. The acting was also Terrific and this got to be the number one movie of 2012 so far for me. It is definitely worth to watch and I promise it is not going to waste the 3 hours of your life! There is a perfect balance of story line, theme, action, romance, and drama in the film though I've got to admit I cried a couple of times in some scenes of the movie. There is definitely not going to be a sequel of this movie but there is going to be another story from it. Again, this movie (and of course its sequel) has got to be the best Superhero movie of all time! Bat Man is a human and superhero role model. Great job on this movie Dark Night team!"
"Luckily for me, I got to see the premiere of this masterpiece around 3 days before the rest of the world. I had been looking forward to Rises ever since I heard the last words in The Dark Knight and let me tell you, it was well worth the wait. The plot was well thought out and the acting was superb, however with that said the acting was not close to that of Heath Ledger's spectacular performance in The Dark Knight. It was the perfect end to an incredible trilogy, Nolan has well earned a spot on my list of favorite directors. The only reason I gave this movie a 9/10 is because I do not believe that any film to date is ""perfect"", but the Dark Knight trilogy comes pretty damn close to it."
"As ""The Dark Knight Rises"" opens - picking up eight years after the events chronicled in ""The Dark Knight"" - we find eccentric billionaire Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) in a rather depressed state of mind. He has essentially withdrawn from the world, given up his crime-fighting ways and hung up his Batman cape, having largely fallen out of favor with the citizens of Gotham City who see him less as a hero and more as an out-of-control killer. Only his loyal servant/father-figure, Albert (the venerable Michael Caine), cares enough to give him a swift kick in the rear-end every now and again to try to get him to move on with his life. All this changes, however, when the fascistic Bane comes to town, a figure so consummate in his villainy that he is willing to blow up the whole blasted metropolis with an atomic bomb if he doesn't get what he wants.

Though Christopher Nolan's latest entry in the series is nowhere near as engaging or as gripping as the previous two (especially the second), the movie attains a certain historical and contemporary significance with its echoes of both the French Revolution and Occupy Wall Street, though, oddly, the movie seems intent on putting us on the wrong side of history in both cases (rooting for a corrupt status quo and against a grass-roots uprising against that corruption).

And, let's face it, Heath Ledger's Joker - one of the richest villains in all of movie history - would be a hard act for anyone to follow, and Tom Hardy's Bane, even with his mask and amplified voice, seems a mite tame in comparison. On his own terms, however, Bane is reasonably effective, if only because of the implacable nature of his evil, which manifests itself in his willingness to sacrifice masses of innocent people to enrich his own power.

Thanks partly to the muddled politics and partly to the overstuffed nature of the storytelling, the movie never finds a way to fully engage its audience in the world it's created. In fact, in comparison to the narrative sturdiness of its two predecessors, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" comes across as a bit of a messy affair overall, with subplots spinning off in all directions, with little gravity at the core to bind it all together. A case in point: while Anne Hathaway brings a degree of flirtatious charm to the role of cat burglar-turned-Cat Woman, the character as a whole seems like an afterthought, tacked onto the story to provide some counter-balancing romantic interludes for the sullen, all but monastic Wayne.

The cast is rounded out by Gary Oldman, Marion Cotillard, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Aaron Eckhart and others, but, more so than in the two previous entries in the series, the real stars of ""The Dark Night Rises"" turn out to be the visual pyrotechnics and special effects."
"So is The Dark Knight Rises better than The Dark Knight? If you were one of those fans who prefer Batman Begins to TDK then you'll find much to love about TDKR. And if you weren't then no Batman film will ever match TDK for you. (SPOLIER ALERT)And yes, it is The End, a resounding resolution for what Batman Begins begun. Threads from that film are picked up, lengthened and strengthened, bringing a staunch integrity – in every sense – to the overall arc. Is it perfect? Factor in some clunky catch-up exposition near the start, a cringey log-fire love scene and moments where Hans Zimmer's score nearly foghorns the actors off the screen and the answer's no. An even bigger question: is it up there with The Dark Knight? Not quite."
"This has, honestly, got to be one of the best films of all time. Whereas Batman Begins was a David and Goliath story, The Dark Knight was a duel, then TDKR is war. This film is a brutal, deep, thoughtful,touching, tale of redemption and destruction. The cast is superb but the standout is Joseph Gordon Levitt as a rookie cop who is ahead of the game. Although Tom Hardy gives him a run for his money as a re-imagined Bane, a terrorist that truly believes in a cause, rather than just anarchy, and that makes him truly terrifying. Even Anne Hathaway brought her game as Selina Kyle who acts whatever part she needs to. Everyone should see this film, although I will warn you that the violence in it is extreme for the rating and really pushes what you can do in a film of this classification"
"First things first, don't watch the Rises without watching the Begins. You will surely miss the heart and soul of the movie.

This movie is not about the action, the conflict, the villain or the hero. Nolan returns to the roots of this series by making Bruce learn more about fear. Bruce must learn the power of fear yet again, see it in a new way and learn to use it in a different way.

The expected things are all there, the villain winning the first battle, hero returning stronger, nice twists, action and fist fights, new gadgets, effects. But don't let them blind you, look deeper and you would find the crowning jewel of this series.

Another thing worth mentioning, the soundtrack is amazing!!"
"Christopher Nolan is becoming a modern day Stanley Kubrick. However Nolan needs to do more films for that to be seen more fully and of course Kubrick was Kubrick, he was untouchable with his films. Nonetheless, Nolan is very detailed/meticulous/precise with everything in his films, from the smallest thing to the most important thing in the film, just like Kubrick.

Nolan knows how important good sound, good sound editing and a great music score can be in bringing the film from good to great. I would say 8 times out of 10 if a film has everything going for it, but has a lousy music score, it will be a good film, but not great. And same goes if the film has a great music score, but it's missing good directing or good acting, just some element. The opening scenes in The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises are great and fun scenes to watch over and over again because of the great music score that's going along with the scene. Plus the music score in those opening scenes makes the stakes that much more important. The music score goes with a film like peanut butter and jelly, like a cigarette with an adult beverage.

I'm not sure, but it looks as if Nolan doesn't use any CGI in the Batman films either, which makes it more of a long film process for Nolan but at the same time it makes for a better movie too because Nolan is not sloppy or lazy with his action sequences, again, he's very meticulous with everything.

CGI in ways has made the process quicker for filmmakers, but at the same time it's made it easy for the filmmakers to get sloppy and lazy and mass produce crap like the Transformer Movies or The Avengers. And yes, I did not like The Avengers, it's like every other mass produced action film, it's sloppy. But Nolan with his Batman movies, the action is very detailed and there's nothing sloppy about the action or the movie as a whole, and that's because Nolan isn't concerned with mass producing something for monetary value, he's concerned with making a quality film.

Another thing Nolan does, if you ever notice, each main character from all the Batman movies has their own theme music. The Scarecrow had his, the Joker had his, and Bane has his. Batman has his of course as well. But for a director to give each bad guy their own theme music, that takes careful planning and a lot of patience. Most directors don't have that kind of patience these days, except for the greats such as Spielberg and Scorsese.

A big theme from all the Batman movies by Nolan, is 'rising'. From Bruce Wayne having memories of his Dad saying ""Why do we fall, so we can learn to pick ourselves up again."" to the Rising out of the prison in The Dark Knight Rises, it's a continuing theme about rising. Nolan is brilliant in his writing in this sense.

Bruce Wayne learns(in all the Batman movies by Nolan) what a recovering addict of alcohol or drugs learns, which is everything in life isn't an all or nothing thing, it's not an event, it's an on-going process and it truly is a journey. You need help from people as you can't do it all by yourself. Bruce Wayne as Batman may get all the glory, but he always gets and has help to get there.

Bane at one point in the movie says to Batman ""Victory has defeated you."" Meaning, everything has become an event for Batman now, unimportant, and Batman is kind of like how Rocky Balboa was in Rocky 3 at this point against his first meeting with Bane, which is he's not careful or afraid anymore, he doesn't look at all the factors or variables anymore, he's cocky in his apathy.

Bruce Wayne has to learn again that it's a process, that it's always been a process and to truly be happy with what he wants and needs in life he needs to be aware of this fact again. Which he eventually becomes aware of again, and ultimately finds happiness because of this fact.

Just an all around great movie though, terrific action, great directing and writing, Tom Hardy as Bane is spectacular, what a great and fun actor he is to watch as well as Christian Bale as Batman and Gary Oldman as the Commissioner. A very fun movie to watch over and over with some deep meaning behind everything that is going on from beginning to end. Also a terrific performance from Anne Hathaway as Catwoman, she really pulls this part off well, very well in fact, I was very impressed with her. See this movie if you haven't yet!"
"I would describe this movie as a great production with great directing and a terrific cast where in my opinion everyone put in great work. I am not gonna spoil anything specific from the movie but just say that its obviously a huge production with great talent behind it and a very worthy third movie by the today legendary Christopher Nolan. It is in my opinion a great movie and lives up to the huge hype witch in itself is an amazing achievement. The movie will be seen by all previous fans and you should see it but I can not agree that this is The Dark Nights finest movie even after all the great work put in and with all the great scenes combined with the best of effects with this huge budget. I consider this movie a great one but far from my top five and even this great movie in the Batman category would be behind ""The Dark Knight"" but as u know, that certainly doesn't mean it couldn't be great. Go and see it!"
"In the long build-up to this film, I started to believe it would surpass The Dark Knight. But it did not. However, it was a fulfilling ending. The fact that Nolan's reboot of the Batman franchise had an official ending was fulfilling enough itself, simply because it gave the Batman a purpose.

Bale was once again a great Bruce Wayne/Batman. Sadly, Michael Caine as Alfred played a much smaller role than he has done in the last two films. However, we saw Alfred Pennyworth at his most profound in this film which was, despite being very emotional, a great feature.

Tom Hardy was the perfect actor for the role of Bane. And Bane was he perfect villain for the final instalment of Nolan's trilogy. We finally see someone who can match Batman both mentally and, more importantly, physically. A couple of lines of his were a bit muffled and hard to hear, but that has no effect on the film and its plot. The inclusion of Selina Kyle, or unofficially ""Catwoman"" was also great feature. While characters such as that do run the risk of bringing a more 'comic-book feel' to the film (something which the absence of has made Nolan's films much better), her character worked well with the story and Anne Hathaway was great in the role.

Now, onto the film itself. If you go into this film expecting it to blow the Dark Knight out of the water, you're going to be disappointed. TDK managed to feature so many great scenes and all with so much depth within the same time frame as TDKR. This film, however, seemed to be a bit rushed. Not in the sense that it lacks quality in aspects such as acting or directing, but mainly due to the film trying to cover too much time in too little film time. Emotional parts of the film are over too quickly. A few aspects are also left unanswered in the film, too.

On a more positive note, though, the film is packed with great action, special effects, twists, and emotion throughout, with bits of humour in between. Nolan does not disappoint. Nor do any of the actors in their roles.

All in all, TDKR was a fulfilling end to Nolan's Batman trilogy. However, a lot of the film seemed rushed and some, perhaps trivial, parts of the film are left to assumption. While the acting was by no means bad, it is unlikely that it will sweep any awards shows. The special effects, on the other hand, will be where the film competes with the other blockbusters this year in terms of awards.

Regardless of how this film compares to the previous two films in your opinion, The Dark Knight Rises is a film you will certainly be able to watch over and over again."
"The Dark Knight Rises is an exceptional film without a shadow of a doubt. The acting, plot, direction, score and story telling are all top notch. Now I want to get this out of the way as soon as possible, a lot of people are comparing Bane to the Joker but you cannot do this, simply on the soul fact... they are completely different characters. The Joker was dark, cunning and knew how to manipulate those we all thought couldn't be, however Bane is without a doubt Batman's strongest opponent physically and mentally, he pushes Bruce Wayne/Batman to the brink of destruction throughout the movie, his physical presence in itself is extremely intimidating not to mention his distinctive voice. There are a lot of plot twists also throughout the movie which fit brilliantly within the story telling and the last 40 minutes are one of the greatest in cinematic history. I don't want to say much more because words simply can't describe how brilliant this movie is and in my opinion beats TDK and I never thought I would say that because TDK is a cinematic triumph across the board. All that's left to say now is thank you Mr. Nolan for a truly wonderful trilogy that concluded in epic style."
"I know most people did not like how bane was played or portrayed, but I loved him as a villain. I actually loved the voice that Nolan gave him. To me he was a menacing and impactful villain in the movie. I also thought the plot by Miranda Tate was exceptional. It was devious and deceiving, while deceptively cunning. Sure there was things that Nolan could have done without (the kiss scene between batman and catwoman), but the overall vision for Batman was exceptional. I also like that he left the possibility open for future movies featuring Robin! I loved the original batman with Michael Keaton, but the following batman movies left a sour taste in my mouth."
"Batman (Christian Bale) comes out of self-imposed retirement to defeat terrorist Bane (Tom Hardy) who has taken over Gotham City.

The CGI and other stunts were nothing short of fantastic and almost unbelievable. Kudos. The acting performances all around are good, although there are times the dialogues were difficult to hear clearly. The music was very good, yet haunting.

I like this but it was too long. I liked this but was made to feel very uncomfortable when Bane takes over Gotham. I felt I was part of the Gotham citizenry living in total anarchy, and I couldn't see any way out. Bane imprisons most of the police force in the sewers of Gotham and closes the openings via explosions; he also creates, via explosions, deep holes in the football field and takes over Gotham in the guise of giving the people their freedoms.

I liked this but Batman is in a deep prison cell after Bane defeats him and the only way out is to rock-climb a long circular wall to freedom. I liked this, but I don't like to see my superheroes become too human. I liked this but it was too dark.

But mostly, I liked this knowing the Dark Knight would make things right. Isn't that why we go to the movies and stay to the end? In most cases staying to the end resolves many questions we have during the show, but here at THIS end, we still have questions.

Is the Dark Knight dead and that ends the trilogy? Do we see the emergence of Robin to fight crime? Will Robin fight alone? Does everyone now know Bruce Wayne is or was Batman? At the end, does Alfred (Michael Caine) really see what we see him seeing or is it just wishful thinking? Is Batman really dead?

Stay tuned to this Bat Channel to see what Christopher Nolen, the Director, comes up with next (9/10)

Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No."
"Careful as I have been over the past few days to avoid all contact with outside world, should someone/thing reveal plot points in the movie and spoil the experience, I still ended up looking at a few news articles that mentioned that ""critics"" found the movie as an ""epic letdown"". Well, I've now seen the movie and I just don't see what those guys are talking about. The movie's awesome, more so when you watch it in IMAX. The story, locales, the special effects, background score, dialogues, acting - everything comes together perfectly and the almost-3-hours go past in a whiz. We get to see more of Bruce Wayne than Batman (though not as much as in ""Batman Begins"") and Christian Bale does give a nice performance. Same goes for the others too (though as charming as Anne Hathaway appeared in all her scenes, I'd have preferred seeing the gorgeous self of Selina Kyle in non-black-dresses too).

One sore point was Bane's voice. The garbled-speech pattern in his ""voice"" was little unsettling and at times the background score would drown his dialogues out. Just like Batman's voice in ""The Dark Knight"", this was disappointing. The dialogues, at certain times, would appear a little contrived and not ""fit"" the scene. In all honesty, the movie wasn't as good as TDK, but it was close. And a part of the reason behind it is that in TDKR, the villain is not as enigmatic as The Joker. Tom Hardy does give a good performance as Bane, but there is only so much you can act with just your eyes and half your face in a mask.

Many have felt that the ending could've been better. I, on the contrary, felt that the ending was the most appropriate end that the trilogy could've had. All said and done, there is no doubt that the movie is right up there with the rest of Chris Nolan's movies and he continues to dazzle the viewers with his brilliance."
"It was never really a question of whether the third and final act in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy would be good. Nolan doesn't make lousy films – and even at their most critically divisive (Inception comes to mind), he uses filmier techniques and spectacle that leave most Hollywood epics in the dust, heads spinning. So, no – 'The Dark Knight Rises' was always assured some degree of quality. But just how much are we talking here? A brief word on the story – spoiler- free as always. You'll want to go back and re-watch Batman Begins before heading to The Dark Knight Rises. It, arguably more than the Joker-focused sequel, has more to do with the unfolding events in the closing chapter than you might expect. Nolan sets this entry up to really validate his Batman films as a true trilogy, linking together characters and excerpts from the first two films, recapping the key points with well-edited care, and managing to land this character- heavy, expository behemoth with a steady hand. This is an achievement on par with the greatest film trilogies of the 20 and 21 centuries – no exaggeration"
"After the Dark Knight was released I couldn't avoid the hype that surrounded it and decided to give the two first movies a watch. I thought both movies were okay but not spectacular, apart from the memorable Joker. The thing is, i can't just name exactly what caused it but both movies just bored me a bit. I think this feeling is caused mainly because the world of Gotham doesn't get a lot of attention. Sure, we see skyscrapers, Batman's mansion and an occasional location for a fighting scene but it isn't enough, it makes the city feel like a cardboard background, which for me just kills the atmosphere and chance to immerse myself in this fictional world. Besides this, i like Christian Bale in most movies but as Batman...he just can't convince me! The fact that he changes his voice when being Batman doesn't help, it just sounds silly.

But okay, I was entertained enough to watch the close of the trilogy and i must say, it was the best movie of the three. Bane is an awesome bad guy and the movies has some 'big moments' (that collapsing stadium!) that shocked me. My biggest complaint is that the pace of the movie slows down considerably after the stadium scene. It seems that after Bane conquers Gotham he just does NOTHING! Then it is just a matter of time before Batman saves the day. The ending was cool though but again...this trilogy just isn't for me. In most cases i can understand/share the love for a movie/trilogy but here it seems i am living in a different dimension, a dimension in where i think Gotham should be portrayed as a vivid but grimy city, with things like crazy nightlife filled with shady characters and a Batman who talks like Batman..even when he is off duty."
"In 2005, Christopher Nolan took it upon his shoulders to completely erase the horror that was Batman & Robin.

Today, as his trilogy is complete, heads are bowed before the man who not only redeemed the Legend, but took him to new heights.

To compare TDKR to any of the previous parts is as wrong as it is to compare it with Tim Burton's run on Batman, as wrong as trying to compare it with Knightfall, as wrong as comparing it with anything in this world! TDKR towers and triumphs as a fitting finale to the Gotham City that was personally created by the Nolan Brothers.

Yes, it does have its flaws, most notably being that Batman is and always will be the ""World's Greatest Detective"" and TDKR pays little heed to that aspect.

Yes, as a stand-alone film, the plot line does become too heavy to carry its own weight towards the latter half.

And Yes, it does leave a myriad of questions unanswered.

But, does it create an all-new tale of the Caped Crusader? One that will be devoured by fans over and over again? HELL YES! Each frame is packed with powerhouse performance pieces, be it Christian Bale's vulnerable Bruce Wayne or Anne Hathway's sexually charged Selina Kyle. Tom Hardy creates a truly menacing Bane – using only his eyes to convey so much. Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate plays her character to the hilt and the real surprise of the film is Joseph-Gordon Levitt as Officer Blake, who storms through the film, portraying an officer of Gotham PD with true aplomb.

Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine have been superb since the first part and they only push themselves further in TDKR, as does Hans Zimmerman with his outstanding score.

But the true stars of this film, as well as the entire trilogy are the Nolan Brothers who lovingly created this realistic Gotham, who took us on a journey from a young and angry Bruce Wayne to an aging and suicidal one, who pushed each building block of the foundations they had created in 2005 and who lulled the viewers into a false sense of victory and then brought them down like a house of cards, who hoisted them up one moment and broke their backs the other.

In TDKR, the Nolan Brothers bring forth the vulnerability of Bruce Wayne to the forefront, pitting him against Bane, a mercenary with no fear, trying to break the spirit of Bruce and to an extent, succeeding even.

It's a tale of good v/s evil, of might v/s right, of conscience v/s external influences.

It's a tale that is multi-layered, multi-faceted and a delight at multiple levels.

It's a tale, that shall soon not be forgot."
"I expected a technological and moral extravaganza, evil Bane, mighty Bruce and sexy women. I got all of that and more. However, the extra I got from the quality of the special effects, the design of the weird flying or road machines and the actors play I lost on the plot.

They have tried so hard to make it more that they made something different. Yes, Batman is a workaholic in disguise, obsessed of saving the city of Gotham, yes, Morgan Freeman knows all and, yes, in the end good prevails in a dark world. We already knew that when we started watching the film. All the extra stuff they've put in was just spam. The legend of the Pit, the megalomaniac threat to the city, the people that just stay put because they have no bridge, the ridiculous fighting scenes when Batman is either too weak or too strong and he doesn't use any of the tech to actually help him win the fight, all of these made it feel like I was watching a bad movie blown up to gigantic proportions.

The actors. I liked Tom Hardy in the fighter and he made this film, as well. He is clearly a talented actor and this is his rise (see what I did there?). Christian Bale was almost not present in the film. He smiled a little, then cried a little, did some pushups and got screwed by every woman he met. Anne Hathaway has a rather hard to buy role, but she was more than OK and helped make the film seem more complex than it actually was. Gary Oldman was useful, but not really doing anything complicated. As for the others in the full cast of the film, they barely registered.

Bottom line: the entire plot is based on characters from the previous movies by Nolan. You should refresh your memory on those before you watch it. The feeling of the film is impressive because they tried very hard to make it so, but all the cool scenes you can watch in the trailer and the rest is a convoluted plot that doesn't make a lot of sense. The film is redeemed by the great quality of its making, meaning well spent big budget, and of the actors play. All in all, an average movie, but fun nevertheless. Oh, and Robin doesn't suck."
"After reading so many good reviews I was expecting a lot more from this movie. The time line is completely screwed, events even more impossible than any other super hero or even science fiction movie I've seen lately and I can't count the number of times I thought ""Oh come on!.. that's just ridiculous"".

Certainly there are nice images and interesting characters but the story sucks so much it made the movie absolutely boring and ridiculous to me.

I was not a fan of the previous Batman movies but at least I found something interesting the first 2 movies of this trilogy. This is more like a science fiction movie and nothing like the other movies which were a lot more realistic and close to my idea of what Batman should be like."
"I won't even compare 'The Dark Knight Rises' with 'The Dark Knight', simply because there's no need to compare them.

Instead I'd like to focus on the greatness achieved with this movie. I have to admit, there are some flaws. But every movie has them. Every. And even though it has its flaws, this movie, in its entirety with its message and amazingly realistic trilogy-storyline, is without doubt a masterpiece we will all talk about years after.

It's just unbelievably beautiful to see that there are still movies that make people watch them in theaters. Even though very bad, shocking things happened that are associated with it, even though people lost their lives making the movie and watching the movie. Even though many things did not turn out how you could've thought they would turn out, this trilogy has found its way in our culture, making people want to see it no matter what happened, by taking us on a very emotional travel in which we all can find our consolation, our will, our bravery."
"Look, don't sit here reading this. Go out and watch it. Now. You won't be disappointed, I promise. As IMDb requires ten lines, I have to make an effort to at least recommend it. It's electrifying. Hardy and Hatheway are amazing. Everything leads up to this climatic ending which is stunning. Although not as amazing as The Dark Knight, this comes off feeling almost as strong because of its visually astonishing set pieces and deafening score by the dependable Hans Zimmer. The lack of CGI only adds to the believability. I'm excited to be growing up in a day and age where a movie about a costumed bat running around beating up bad guys can be considered as one of the most influential films of all time. And it is. It truly is. Look, you know you're going to see it. Leave Avengers lying in the dust with a mere 1 billion and lets see this movie make several billions. P.S Australia rules, we get it a day early :)"
"The Dark Knight Rises is not only the greatest third entry into The Dark Knight trilogy but its the greatest third outing for any trilogy. The director went all out on this one and it payed off. The film introduces us to a 'rusty' Batman who goes into hiding but as the mysterious Catwoman and the terrifying Bane, so Batman must 'rise' up and protect Gotham City. The directing in this film is the 'best' i have seen ever. The writing is absolutely perfect, the story rounds out the trilogy like a masterpiece, the characters are so well written and invested into the story, they are played by some of the greatest actors of all time and they did an awesome job some of them need Oscar nods. The ending is so powerful and so emotional that i was bawling, this is a war film but at the very heart of the story is an emotional, powerful, action, drama film, which has been done to perfection. I saw this at the midnight release and it was worth it! Amazing in every aspect, the film does not feel like t goes for 2 45 minutes, it goes so fast but thats what a good movie should do and i am not just saying this because i am a 'batman' fan or a 'christopher Nolan' fan but seriously, everyone needs to see this. You will love it!! It was worth the wait and now Christopher Nolan is now one of my favorite writers and directors, the film deserves best picture!!! Loved every second of it!! 5/5"
"WOW strap yourself in this is going to be remembered long after you leave the cinema. Without giving you any spoilers let me just say from the opening sky high scene that rivals the best of any James Bond scenario the pace is set for a bleak, but thrilling 'so called' conclusion mastermind Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight series. Soon to be the new Mad-Max, Tom Hardy (seen but not forgotten in Sucker Punch) plays ultra bad guy Bane with amazing confrontation. Challenging Batman mentally and physically you will not soon forget his chaotic reign. Anne Hathaway albeit an alarming choice as Selina/Catwoman will surprise the die-hards while the amazing cast is listless, Michael Caine has some tender moments amongst the mayhem and new addition Joseph Gordon-Levitt challenges to further his history with and legacy of the Wayne foundation. Spiderman will spin off into the distance the minute the caped crusader appears in cinemas. Must see."
"The Dark Knight Rises has an epic scale and grandeur unlike any other modern film and rivals the scope of such classic films as The Godfather, Gone with the Wind, and Lawrence of Arabia. What Christopher Nolan has done here is achieve a rare feat matched only by Peter Jackson, Sergio Leone, and Ingmar Bergman. He has crafted a near perfect film trilogy, where each film can stand on its own as well as against its counterparts, and the Nolan Batman trilogy is, beyond a doubt, the greatest comic book trilogy in film history.

That being said, The Dark Knight Rises is not without flaws. The main issue lies within the first 30 minutes of the film, which jumps around quite a bit and reveals a couple of the logical fallacies that prevent the film from being Nolan's masterpiece, a title I would still give to Inception. These fallacies are small enough that they in no way inhibit the enjoyment of the picture (with one exception, which doesn't inhibit enjoyment so much as it puts into question a critical plot point of the film), and, due to the volume of fresh characters we are introduced to, a certain jumpiness is necessary in order to get the plot moving. However, there is a moment about an hour and a half into the film, that propels the film onto another level, where all previous issues are cast aside and you are swept up in the sheer scale of what is occurring on screen, and from this point on I have no hesitation in calling the final half of this film a masterwork.

From top to bottom the cast of The Dark Knight Rises excels. Michael Caine in particular shines in just a few scenes, providing the emotional backbone needed for a film of this nature, and Christian Bale continues to be great in his underrated performance as Bruce Wayne. Joseph Gordon-Levitt also excels in a more reserved performance as Officer John Blake, and Anne Hathaway is better than anyone could have imagined as Selina Kyle. While Tom Hardy wasn't given much opportunity to flex his acting skills, his performance did provide the necessary physicality to buy Bane as a very potent opponent of Batman. Not Tom Hardy's fault, but I should note that Bane's voice may be difficult to discern initially, creating more confusion in the opening sequence than need be, but after a couple scenes his dialogue is much more easily discernible. If there is one complaint to have with the cast it's that Marion Cotillard, perhaps the greatest actress of her generation, is underused in her supporting role as Miranda Tate.

I would like to make one note on the cinematography of the film. Christopher Nolan is perhaps second only to Martin Scorsese and Paul Thomas Anderson in his use of the camera as a storytelling tool, and this skill becomes clear during the spectacularly shot action sequences, almost all of which were shot on 70mm IMAX film. If you can see this film on an IMAX screen, and not an AMC IMAX screen but a real IMAX screen, this is the one film that positively begs to be viewed on a screen as large as possible.

In the end, the sheer scale of The Dark Knight Rises blows away the logical fallacies that inevitably accompany a film of this nature. It takes the best elements of its predecessors, the epic scale of The Dark Knight combined with the psychology of Batman Begins (which must be viewed before watching TDKR), to craft one of the most satisfying third acts in motion picture history. If there is one last complement to be given to Christopher Nolan, it is that he has created the end all Batman trilogy. There will inevitably be more Batman films made in the future, but nothing will ever come close to what Nolan has accomplished with his three films. He revolutionized the industry, brought a sense of realism back to both Batman and the superhero genre as a whole, and forever raised the standard to which blockbuster films must be held.

Grade: 8.5/10 (A-)"
"Christopher Nolan's Batman films have both surprised & disappointed me. On one-hand, Nolan has strived to ground the mythos into as realistic and relatable setting as possible. Given the suspension of disbelief needed for most of these comic book adaptations, the change was risky and admirable. However, along the way, specifically with the second film 'The Dark Knight', Nolan's realistic setting is at odds with increasingly implausible and fantastical happenings. This sense of imbalance carries over to the bloated & meandering final film.

'Rises' spends the greater part of its nearly three-hour runtime in escalation, introducing plot lines & characters that serve too embellish a sense of importance & complexity too the proceedings. The main issue with the film is that the majority of the multiple plot lines are poorly executed and unnecessary. For example, while the character played by Anne Hathaway adds a touch of much needed sarcasm & sensuality to the overtly serious proceedings, her motivations & actions are never explained.

On the other hand, the characters of Bane & John Blake were well-etched and save the film from outright mediocrity. Bane is equal parts fascinating & menacing, with a convincingly crafted back story that forms the emotional core of the film. Whereas the Joker is the titular villain in the Batman mythos, he is ultimately an absurd character that lacked development & conviction in the previous film. While I never viewed Joker as a legitimate threat in the previous film, Bane's actions are well-plotted & he challenges Batman accordingly. However, both characters actions are ultimately unrealistic, resulting in a film that is neither crime drama nor superhero fantasy.

John Blake is the only other character in the film that is well-etched. Unlike Lt. Gordon, Lucius Fox, & Alfred, Blake rises above being mere plot device & garners genuine emotion through a well-developed back story, realistic staging, & strong motivations/actions. As it stands, I found Gordon-Levitt's Blake a far more convincing & interesting character than anything Nolan has written for Bruce Wayne since the end of the first film.

Thus lies the main problem with 'Rises', Bruce Wayne & his Batman alter-ego come off as emotionally stilted & reactionary rather than mature & intelligent. This is most likely based on the poor narrative in the previous film, where I had trouble buying into Wayne's relationships & Batman's fall from grace. The character has simply failed to develop since the first film.

It's not helping that the films script & technical aspects are also poorly manipulated. While Nolan's script for Begins was generally competent, it's still hard to digest moments of thought-provoking dialog intermixed with sophomoric dramatization, & cheesy one-liners.

While a few scenes stood out in this film, particularly in the beginning sequence & Bane's prison, the cinematography on display lacked any sort of flourish, reveling in gritty skylines & explosions over any sort of interesting composition. The action sequences are admirable, if not poorly shot. Sound editing & mixing are first-rate. The score by Hans Zimmer is abysmal.

Overall, The Dark Knight Rises is a film that falters due to a weak foundation. 'Rises' ambition & scope are grand, however, it's setting and characters lack development and conviction, ultimately rendering much of the proceedings hollow & self-important. As summer entertainment, Dark Knight rises is the best of the bunch, a gem amongst a sea of nameless sequels, testosterone driven action films, regressive family fare, & tasteless comedies. As a film, however, 'Rises' has no reason to exist, it stands tall amongst such relevant masterworks as 'Avatar' & 'The Matrix'.

Stay for the taut & thrilling opening sequence that introduces Bane's character, than fast-forward through the rest."
"you disappointed me Nolan, what the f? -cheesy way of ending conflicts -uninteresting characters. -deus ex machine in its cheap form. -sleepy time in action sequences (not in the ""more hardcore action, images that balance content"" persuasion). -destroyed the image of a passionately followed character (not talking about batman). -are you going to slack in next project? -more preproduction man, think stuff trough. -where you in contract debt to finish the movie or something? -you know you are better than writing stuff for the ridiculous ""10 line in comment"" rule last night i proved my girlfriend its a hassle to take care of one another while drunk"
"The Dark Knight definitely is a great conclusion of the Batman trilogy. Nolan has once again captured the essence of how the Batman universe should be like. He has established the right balance of action, suspense, drama and a bit of humor in the film.

Also, adding Bane and Catwoman to the roster of characters is brilliant. Bane (Tom Hardy) induces the right image and feeling of fear, and dominance, added by his sheer display of intellect. His brute physique is matched by his wit, Brains and brawn I might say. While Catwoman (Anne Hathaway) is simply a sight for me to see. Though I was a bit surprised by the idea of Hathaway as Selina Kyle, turns out, she's the perfect and had the done the best performance ever as the feline femme fatale.

Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine are seriously veterans in their craft. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's role as a policeman turned detective gave an awesome performance. Christian Bale definitely pulled the Batman role, this movie had the character at its weakest but still made a strong impression for us.

The effects, I give it a 10, the musical score, definitely a 10++++ thanks Hans Zimmer.

Christopher Nolan, you have portrayed Batman and its characters that are unimaginably the best there is. And I would love to watch it again and again.

:)

*cheers"
"Caught this at the Majestic 10 in Williston, VT on Sunday July 15th. It was a special benefit sponsored by Senator Patrick Leahy. Christopher Nolan demanded that it must be shown in 35mm, so that was an added bonus! A fitting end to the Nolan trilogy. It's hard to pick a favorite of the 3 films, although Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker in The Dark Knight probably makes that film the standout in the trilogy.

As always, ingenious camera-work, sound, visual effects and great acting performances from Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, etc. Anne Hathaway was GREAT as Catwoman. Not as psycho and unpredictable as past portrayals. That's what's great about the Nolan take on this series - making all this plausible through acting, script and casting choices.

Tom Hardy's Bane was a bit of a letdown for me. No fault of Hardy, but Bane is kind of a boring, muscle head type villain. He's got this face mask covering him, making it harder to connect emotionally, and his back-story wasn't really explored in depth. Not nearly as interesting as the villains we've seen.

overall, definitely worth seeing, even if you aren't a Batman fan."
"The Batman is a worshiped character throughout the world of movie goers as well as comic book fans specially after 'The Dark Knight' where the makers achieved the impossible and made you question your ways of thought about the day to day world. The more you plan and scheme, the more things can go NOT according to plan, rather why not embrace chaos? The world isn't fair so why follow moral codes and ethics? Why make friends and why follow the rules set out by someone else? Only a movie like The Dark Knight could have made anyone feel like that.

Christopher Nolan studied literature in college for a reason and that reason is apparent in his films. He brings a sense of great storytelling with the massive scale and canvas for his audiences. He doesn't make movies just for intelligent and spectacular entertainment but forces the viewer to think a lot after one has witnessed his product. He makes the hero more human than anyone else can and tells you how everyone can be a hero in their own universe.

The Dark Knight Rises hovers a lot lower than The Dark Knight simply because it is more of the same. It feels more of a sequel to 'Batman Begins' than anything else. It doesn't blow your mind off. It doesn't show or give you a feeling that you've never had before because the theme of the film revolves around fear and disparity, lies and betrayals and how you choose to rise above that. However it treats the fictional characters as best as possible. There are fantastic elements for the promised epic conclusion but somewhere it lacks a little bit in the tight and nerve jangling screenplays we are used to from the Nolan Brothers. There is a release of pressure in places at times so the audience gets at the edge of the seat then slides back and then comes back up. This one ties all loose ends, the story comes full circle with a promise and hope for a better future without which peace cannot be sustained. The legend ends in style nevertheless.

You do tend to expect more from the man who gave us the Joker's epic lines, which is unfair. In its own right, The Dark Knight Rises Rose well above most films of the Action/Adventure/Crime genre.

These films are beyond actors, beyond technicalities, beyond film makers themselves. If you've ever laughed or cried or cheered at any projected moving image, you cannot afford to miss this trilogy."
The Dark Night Rises is one of mine's favorite movie. Christan Bale and Tom Hardy are classy and they show great commitment to they roles. Fascineting scenes. Just brilliant. After Joker is hard to find a true rival for Batman. But Bane was great and I really enjoyed. I watched this movie two or three time. And I'm gonna watch it again. Such a great story and I'm sad because it can't be minimum ten Batman movies. Who wasn't see this must see it. Now. I really hope this review helped someone who was undecided about this movie. The women in movie was great and I love them. Marion Cotillard and Anna Hathaway are beautiful and really good actresses. They merged they two very good.
"The movie repeatedly refers to events that happened in past movies as though viewers are intimately familiar with those details. If you don't really remember what happened there, be prepared for an eternity (2:45) of asking what's going on. Thankfully though, there is still enough new material to keep the movie reasonably interesting on its own.

I was left feeling unclear about Bane's motives for wanting control of Gotham City and I didn't understand the financial arrangements that Bane invoked to inflict pain.

Plenty of the police elements were ridiculous, for example, how could the sewer gang grow so large without the police knowing about it? Furthermore, Bane not only pre-empts, but relies upon some of the police's actions even though those actions are only triggered by what's presented as genius breakthroughs.

Batman's habit of refusing to use guns is childishly naïve, inconsistent and it occasionally causes the deaths of police. This is a movie that gave me a strong urge to yell at the screen and give advice to the main character."
"I had the privilege of watching ""The Dark Knight Rises"" on IMAX screen and the 70 odd minutes footage shot with IMAX camera.

The movie opens with the introduction of the most talked about villain of the movie, Bane who abducts a Russian nuclear physicist while Bruce Wayne spends his days crippled and low in morale. The cop John Blake brings the need for Batman to Bruce Wayne amidst the mysterious deaths happening at the city sewage outlet and the murder attempt on Commissioner Gordon conducted by Bane's mob. These events ignite the desire in Bruce Wayne to return to Gotham city and remove the peril cast upon Gotham City. In the due course, it is learned that the Bane is a rep. from The League Of Shadows whose interest lies in destroying the crime stricken Gotham city to restore balance in the human civilization. The arrival of the Batman is when Bane attacks the GSE(Gotham Stock Exchange) and tantalizes the taste of Bane's intellect. The cat-woman/Seline is employed by Bane's mob to steal Wayne's fingerprints to manipulate his stock holdings where Bruce is forced to be out of the Wayne Enterprises, depriving him of the support to/from the Applied Sciences department. Lucis Fox, as always, comes back with his latest innovation, The Bat, which is put to most use towards the climax. Miranda, who eventually romances with Bruce, saves the interests of Wayne Enterprise in the nuclear head which is part of a nuclear fusion project along with Lucis Fox, on the request of Bruce Wayne himself.

Catwoman cheats again on the Batman and sells him to Bane, who brutally beats down Batman and locks him up to get hold of his state of art artillery along with the nuclear war head. John Blake, made a detective by Commissioner Gordon, rambles around on the search for Bruce Wayne and finds that a large scale explosive deployment has been done by Bane while the Deputy Commissioner takes all the police force through the maintenance system to smoke up Bane. There comes the rugby match which gets affected by the serial bombing conducted by Bane alongside other city's bridges and places of prominence. This locks up the police under ground and further, the nuclear bomb threat limits the military action.

During his stay at the prison, Batman realizes that Ra's Al Ghul is behind the motive of Bane's to destroy Gotham and also learns about his past.

The Batman returns to action after enough hardship to escape from the prison on the advice of a doctor and finds Gotham in utter chaos after Bane manages to release all the criminals locked up due to Dent's act. With the help of the realized cat-woman and Det. Blake, he releases the police to action and fight the criminals. Batman now has the win over Bane in a fight, who finally gets killed by the cat-woman. 'The Bat' helps the batman to pull over the nuclear bomb to the distant seas and save Gotham finally.

The continuation on TDKR seems most likely after the reappearance of Bruce Wayne, united with Seline and Alfred and the inclusion of the Det. Blake as 'Robin'

Christopher Nolan brought in enough drama into the movie to make it a fitting end)may not be an end as such) to the trilogy, but few instances in the script put the TDKR a line behind the TDK."
"The first thing I have noticed is,,we got a situation in the movie,,and again and again we struct in it. its beyond a movie,,beyond a story. Its about a hope,,about a regular prayer for the man with a mask for the last 4 years when he was running and dogs and cops were chasing him. After watching the dark knight in 2008,,I became the disciple of Batman. after watching the dark knight rises,,I realized he is god. sometimes when your excitement level cross the limits,,,u cant explain much. Same happens to me. Batman is a normal human being, who inspired us to ask Jesus Christ not to take our sins. He is among and within us showing the way of perfection and purification."
"I would give this 8.5/10. It's very, very good.

First and foremost this movie is more about Bruce Wayne than Batman. It's about Bruce learning to live in a world where he feels he has nothing to live for. It's about the demons of the past coming forward to haunt and exact vengeance for those wrongs, and how Bruce must learn to overcome them, and finally learn to live in the present and not the past.

Michael Cain gives an outstanding performance - heartbreaking, even. He has cared for Bruce since the day he was born, and he's seen the pain and suffering he has endured. It's clear Alfred cannot take much more of Bruce living in misery, and the tension between them is palpable.

When Bane arrives and they do their research to find out more about him, Alfred genuinely becomes concerned that Bruce is about to set out on a suicide mission. Worse still, Alfred believes Bruce wants to die in this way.

The rest of the movie is what you'd expect - lots of amazing action, typical, subtle Nolan humor is written throughout. Anne Hathaway provides some much needed distraction and is good eye candy. She also represents the counterpart Bruce needs to move on with his life, or end it.

Bane is an intense and charismatic villain. I hate to say it, but it will take reading the script or watching it a dozen times to understand everything he said. And for anyone that didn't think Tom Hardy was big enough? Well, there's certainly a shot early on that shows his impressive physicality. He's much bulkier and more ripped than Bruce ever was.

The fights between Batman/Bane are what most hardcore fans are looking forward to and they were done well. I won't spoil things too much, but I think they did a good job of showing that Batman is not the fighter he once used to be - age and injury have slowed him down a bit. He really is in a fight for his life when he encounters Bane.

The last 1/2 hour of this movie is brilliant, stunning, and has more twists and emotional resonance than most will have anticipated. It's gripping, heart wrenching, and bittersweet - all at the same time. A stirring conclusion."
"whoa!!! yep.. thats the first word that came to my mind after watching "" THE DARK KNIGHT RISES"" first day first show. And yes the dark knight does rise to the occasion along with its director Christopher Nolan. Finally we have a super hero movie franchise which wont be remembered just for its action and special effects but for the acting prowess of all the actors and the director. I personally didn't have much expectation from the movie,because, lets be honest, the dark knight and late heath ledger as legendary joker gave us everything. thats what i thought to be honest. But the series needed an ending, and what an ending it was.

Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne is as reliable as ever and delivers a flawless performance. our beloved Legends Michael Caine,Morgan Freeman and Garry Oldman( Alfred, Mr.Fox, Commissioner Gordon) once again show in this movie that no matter how big or small a role they have in the movie, the scenes which involved them were truly amazing. But what surprised me the most were the performances of Anne Hathway as Catwoman and Joseph-Gordon Levit as John Blake. They played their parts with amazing perfection and you cant help but to fall in love with the ever so cunning and mysterious Anne Hathaway as the cat-woman. Which leaves us with Tom Hardy as Bane. To be honest i was a bit disappointed when it came to him, not because he didn't do justice to the role( which he totally did) but because Heath Leader as Joker set the standards so high that you cant help but noticing that bane will all his physical presence, strength and the mysterious mask doest quite attract you the same way as joker did.

But in totality, The Dark Knight rises with all its twists and turns and suspense( and trust me there is quite a lot of suspense in it ) totally lives up to its expectations despite being too predictable at times, this movie is a classic and a MUST WATCH. As all good things must come to an end this was the end of the franchise and our beloved superhero, but wait, was it really the end ?? THE LENGEND Doesn't END, BUT INDEED RISES AGAIN!!!"
"After it's prequel ""The Dark Knight"" did not live up to my high expectations due to a confusing, overladen plot, I was positively surprised by Christopher Nolan's conclusion of his Batman trilogy ""The Dark Knight Rises"".

While it's not my personal best comic book (graphic novel!) adaptation ever, since masterpieces like ""Watchmen"" or ""V for Vendetta"", ""Spider-Man 2"" and, I have to admit, even ""Marvel's: The Avengers"" simply thrilled me a great deal more, TDKR is certainly a great action film to enjoy, and as far as I'm concerned, better than the previous one. The nearly three hours it took quickly passed by which is always a good sign and I never had the feeling that the story had no real direction as with TDK. What I liked the most was the villain: Bane

Bane just got me. He's dangerous and he's evil. Even The Joker would have payed him respect if he had done such things at all. A lot of critics compared Bane to Hannibal Lecter because of the martial mouth mask he's wearing, but I'd like to compare him to Darth Vader and Darth Vader is cool. There is a scene near the end of TDKR (those who saw will know) that could have been directly derived from a similar scene in ""Star Wars: Episode 6"", and of course there is this heavily breathing, electronically enhanced voice of his that reminded me the most of the dark lord. Above that, Bane is also a tragic figure who has a heart somewhere beneath all the bull-like muscle mass.The melee between him and Batman belonged to my personal highlights of the entire film although I was somewhat surprised that Batman somehow seemed to have forgotten how to use his utility belt and only relied on the power of his fists which did not really pay off. As a mercenary, Bane commands a huge army of heavily armed mercenary soldiers. Why they're following him and even willing to die for him, unfortunately is left for guessing. Nolan, as often is the case, fails to give a deeper meaning, a deeper understanding to the motivations of his characters, some reason beyond the sheer urge to simply create chaos and destruction. The same goes with Selina Kyle/Catwoman.

Catwoman is an attractive, professional thief with some martial arts skills who is looking for a way out of the criminal milieu and thus comes in touch with Batman. Where she is from, how she has become Catwoman,why she is steeling and the reason for her change of mind remains again unclear. Apart from this, I liked the way she interacted with Batman. Her dialogues were very witty and teasing, you could feel a certain sizzling between them. I find it interesting to draw a comparison to Tim Burton's version of Catwoman and I come to the conclusion that, to me, Michelle Pfeiffer's performance is much more fascinating, much darker and grittier than that of Anne Hathaway who is certainly a very good actress.

Then there is another new character: Joseph Gordon-Levitt as police officer John Blake. Blake is seemingly the most intelligent, most righteous policeman of all the other ones including commissioner James Gordon who is put to shadow by Blake's investigative skills even outshining Batman formerly known as the world's greatest detective who always needed someone to explain him what's going on which does not do him justice. Blake was the driving force while Bruce wallowed in self-pity.

By the way, where was Batman all the time? It's quite remarkable how little screen time the actual main figure had in his own film apart from some fist fights and a few minor action scenes where he was making some cool stunts on his bike or flying around in an aircraft that looked rather like an iron turtle. Instead, Nolan focused on his true identity: Bruce Wayne, an, in the meantime, tired and decrepit shadow of a former glamorous billionaire who is living isolated in his manor like a hermit still mourning the loss of his love Rachel and seemingly deprived of any purpose in life since his initiated ""Dent-law"" freed the city from organized crime. Even his butler and father substitute Alfred sees no good in this inaction and loneliness. What's his proposed cure? Yes, of course, it's a woman. A fact leading to a somewhat clichéd Hollywood-friendly ending.

Nolan is an undoubtedly great director whose approach to present Batman in a more realistic setting and thus being able to address (or rather broach) subjects like the economical crisis, the gab between the rich and poor, environmental issues etc. at the latest, stands on no solid ground as soon as words as ""League of Shadows"" come into play. The circumstance that The Dark Knight is a comic hero after all firstly cannot be ignored and secondly always leads to a tension with the ambitious epic seriousness of the plot which Nolan does not consequently solve. The film is sometimes to serious to be taken seriously, an epos with flaws."
"It has been eight years since Batman vanished into the night, turning, in that instant, from hero to fugitive. Assuming the blame for the death of D.A. Harvey Dent, the Dark Knight sacrificed everything for what he and Commissioner Gordon both hoped was the greater good. For a time the lie worked, as criminal activity in Gotham City was crushed under the weight of the anti-crime Dent Act. But everything will change with the arrival of a cunning cat burglar with a mysterious agenda. Far more dangerous, however, is the emergence of Bane, a masked terrorist whose ruthless plans for Gotham drive Bruce out of his self-imposed exile. But even if he dons the cape and cowl again, Batman may be no match for Bane...."
"well before entering the theater like most of u guys i had 3 questions in mind... 1:would it b worth the 4 year gap? 2:can it outdo the last one (pretty tough one)? and finally would this be the end of the Nolan- batman saga? one thing more i didn't watch a single trailer of this movie on purpose which was pretty hard though....so the excitement was sky high . so after watching the movie ....its not as good as the dark knight ...reasons : heath ledger was too good , the story of this part is not as complex as last one ...this is the kind of story which builds up to a magnificent climax but offers little before ...plus this part deals with more characters than last one so less time to build them up... the MOST INTERESTING and exciting part is the ending which gives a definite hint of a new series!!"

"Whilst I enjoyed the first two Nolan Batman efforts, I cannot understand why the IMDb rating is so high for this film. Many other reviewers are gushing over a film that is

1. Far too long and bloated 2. Contains many embarrassingly clichéd one liners 3. Dilutes the aura surrounding the Batman character

I applaud the fact that this film was shot and finished on film, not digitally, so it LOOKS great, but it is nowhere near Nolan's best work. It had some clever and huge set pieces, but failed to shown any heart. The second movie had set it up for a stunning return of the Bat, but instead tried to be too smart. The ending in particular, was not emotive at all, just sugar coated.

I was squirming in my seat at much of the twee dialogue. And, Batman, get yourself a new voice coach - you sound hilarious, are you supposed to be?"
"A satisfying and beautiful ending to such a significant trilogy with not one flaw. story and character development wise , everything fit perfectly into place in the end and i don't think there's a single thing i would change apart from wanting ANOTHER MOVIE. definitely lives up to the hype 110% and honestly deserved more award attention due to the production and excellence of the film itself - aside from the actors incredible performances (i see u christian 😏). never underestimate the power of christopher nolan."
"After seeing what are arguably two of the best films in cinematic history in Inception and The Dark Knight I had very high hopes for this film. I have followed the Batman films and the TV shows from an early age and I think that Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director, however after paying through the nose to see this conclusion to his trilogy on the opening day I felt he could have done so much more with this film.

I'll start with the good things about this film.

1) Anne Hathaway was surprisingly very good in the film. She offered something new and fresh not seen before and the on screen chemistry with Bale was exceptional. Her character is also a lot more intriguing than that of Tom Hardy's Bane whose muffled, almost in inaudible voice nearly ruins the film by itself.

2) John Blake played by JGL is a strong addition to the cast and his performance as Blake does not go unnoticed.

3) The production values and cinematography are second to none and that is to be expected from a Nolan film.

4) Michael Caine is nothing short of brilliant. He offers raw emotion and substance.Two things which are otherwise lacking in the film.

And sadly that is about all the plus points from this clunky, pretentious, overlong mess of a film. I have the feeling that Nolan's heart just wasn't in this one unlike its predecessors. The script is poor, the pacing is terrible, Tom Hardy is completely wasted in his role and worst of all it doesn't feel like a Batman film. There is no tension or suspense and the story lacks flow and direction. The film offers short glimpses of excellence such as the chase scene between batman and the police and the scene between Alfred and Bruce where Alfred tries desperately to try and convince Bruce to hang up his cape for good. The second fight scene between Batman and Bane is also pretty entertaining as is the last ten minutes. But for a film that clocks in at nearly three hours these scenes are not enough to save it.

Another annoying thing about the film is the action or lack of. Most of the action scenes are given away in the trailers and none of which are that original apart from the scene at the start. Big explosions and lots of guns and that's about it. Batman doesn't even get that much screen time. But the most disappointing thing is the weak script and cheesy dialogue both of which are not something that Nolan usually gives us. Way too many things going on and every character for some reason feels the need to give their own Harvey Dent style declaration along the lines of ''you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain''.

It is so disappointing for me to be writing a bad review for this film and as for everyone saying it's brilliant or it's just as good as the others they are simply in denial or they're flat out lying. It is neither terrible or brilliant. I will of course buy it when it comes out on DVD as it is a good film and deserves a 7 out of 10 and should be viewed more than once and I expect my mind to wander on second viewing as some parts are boring. Just don't go into this movie with high hopes or expecting to see a masterpiece because it simply isn't.

Massive Disappointment."
"One star for Joseph Gordon-Levitt's fresh and believable take on the rookie cop with street smarts, ideals and courage.

One star for Anne Hathaway's purr-fect performance as the Catwoman.

One star for an aging Michael Caine, in memory of the man who was a king.

Beyond that, it's all a murky sea of meaningless explosions, sodden speeches, missed opportunities, and plot holes you could drive the Batmobile through.

Some lowlights include . . .

A super villain who mumbles so much he might just as well have a sock in his mouth. And speaking of laundry, why can't Bane afford an undershirt?

A doctor who explains in clinical detail, with X-rays, exactly why Bruce Wayne can't fight anymore. Just so his fight scenes will feel even more fake than they already did.

A pointless half hour in a phony-looking prison in some make believe foreign country where guys walk around all day clapping and chanting. Cool Hand Luke, this ain't. I really didn't care if Bruce Wayne climbed out of that stupid hole with a rope -- but then, the guards didn't seem to care much either. (""Climbin' out of here, boss!"" ""Yeah, Bruce, climb on out of there."") All I wanted was for Bruce to ""prove"" himself by eating fifty eggs, like in the Paul Newman classic. And at the end he could send the boys a postcard of him back in Gotham City, wearing a custom-made suit, with his arms around Miranda and Selena Kyle. And the card could just say, ""Boys, playing it cool -- Bruce.""

A staggering total of 3000 cops trapped in a sewer for three months -- yet they all emerge in clean uniforms, in good health, ready to beat Bane's minions in a good old-fashioned street brawl. And even that was more exciting than watching Bane and Batman go one-on-one.

This movie could have been twice as good and half as long, with one tenth of the money spent. All it takes is imagination, courage, and respect for the audience."
Very good Film to watch with family. Lots of Action Suspense and Drama. Lots of really good talent. The movie is one to add to your collection if you have any of the others. Always looking forward for more to come from the Actors. The story line is great and is always different with each film. They use different Men to play the part but they always choose the right men to play the parts. Would love to act in a future film of the movie or meet the actors in person. The movie can become so real for kids they pretend to be the actor on the movie. Love how it keeps kids looking forward to want to be the action hero. By wearing capes even little girls get involved in the action as well.
"Jan 6, 2022 While everyone can agree that Batman Begins is the worst of the Nolan trilogy I think people severely underrate this movie while focusing on the Dark Knight. The Dark Knight is a great movie with Ledger's performance being iconic but personally The Dark Knight Rises is all around a better movie. It is very well shot (as most of Nolan's movies are) and it's a really great storyline personally. A great cast to surround Bale with actors like Tom Hardy, Anne Hathaway, Joseph Gordon Levitt along with the usuals who were around from the last 2 films. The movie is full of iconic moments from me and a great way to end the trilogy one of the best payoffs that the character could get. The only criticism I have is the lack of development for certain characters and the reveals being mildly sudden and often unnecessary but otherwise a great movie all around and it gets a light 4 from me."
"With beautiful cinematography, top tier acting, powerful score, a solid plot, perfect ending, perfect pacing, great balance, nice CGI, amazing dialogues... The Dark Knight Rises is a greatly satisfying and epic conclusion to the trilogy.

""A hero can be anyone, even a man doing something as simple and reassuring as putting Aa coat around a young boy's shoulders to let him know the world hadn't ended."""
"I love heath ledger and his joker in the dark knight, but this movie has the perfect cat woman and an amazing bane. It's one of the most motivational movies as well. Christopher Nolan is the best director of all time."
"This had the polar opposite expectations that Begin had because it followed up one of the best movies ever made while begins followed by one of the worst movies ever made. It's not to say this is flawless because there are a couple of nitpicks I personally have but this is a fantastic way to wrap up the entire trilogy. It has one of the best villains to be ever put on film and I mean it. Bane's voice, his demeanor, and Tom Hardy's performance are intimidating but he is also similar to Batman because he is doing it for someone he loves. People are mad about the twist, calling him a henchman. He is no henchman, he is an ally. We even see that after Talia left, he attempted to kill Batman which is smart as hell because he didn't want things to go sideways, but they did. The way he dies acts karma because Bane killed people like pawns and it went full circle because Selina Kyle made a joke which treated him like it was nothing. Also, if he died slower, it would just waste time. And Bruce's journey is one of the best things because people point out that it's repetitive, and it's not. The first time, he puts the cape and cowl on, he becomes a suicide bomber, he is certain he will die and he can't stop Bane from burning Gotham to ashes, he is doing it for selfish desires because he believes there is nothing there for him, and when he climbs out of the pit, he returns to the symbol he was. Also, Bruce climbing out of the prison is fantastic and him getting into the city isn't a plothole because he used the 23 days he had and you know BB told us that he knew to steal, and someone forgot about being invisible. Also, the neighboring city isn't on lockdown, so he can get in there just to go to the city. Seriously, it's so bloody apparent. Also, this is the most thematic of the entire trilogy, with the theme of love, redemption, corruption, and vengeance"
"There're so many negative aspects of this movie it's hard to point out all of them. The title of this writing might be weird, but that is what I felt about this movie - an empty tin can!

The first impression that I had after watching this movie is it's all made up, like a clichéd dialog in the movie ""It's all part of a plan!"" The director already decided what ""AWE FACTOR""s he is going to cover. I used the term from an official documentary of the Dark Knight Rises, most likely from Tom Hardy.

It looks like the director and the producers thought that ""Oh! It's the finale, it must have these and these elements."" Then they fabricated a story to tie up the lose ends, and this story was also made up rather hastily.

What this produces is a completely predictable, unintelligent and repetitive movie. There is no intense drama, thrills, or intense action, no feel, and no philosophical or psychological dilemma that conjured up the first two movies of the trilogy. In other words, things that made Batman Begins and Dark Knight special are completely absent from this movie.

What is more depressing to see is that people are fooled by the deception and the movie gets a high rating round about 9.0

If I trust the rating system and there has been no anomaly there then only possible explanation can be due to wide media-hype, the movie gained a huge audience who are not even familiar with the depth and strength of the first two movies and got baffled by the ""AWE FACTOR""s and came out of the theater satisfied.

The character development in this movie is very weak to say for the least and their attitude and behavior is rather cheesy and unnecessarily replicating that of the Dark Knight. Has anyone actually noticed the opening scene of hijacking Dr. Pavel from the aircraft? The scene is enthralling to watch in IMAX, but the reason behind this adventurous (suicidal in real-life scenario!) attempt is really trivial. And the acting, dialogue, finger-pointing of the CIA officer who is in command of the plane is more like the joker in the Dark Knight. Well it's 8 years later. But the mood still bears the flavor of Dark Knight, which is rather out of place.

The only plus the movie has is Bane, his voice in the Blu-ray release is OK, but in theatrical release it is hardly understandable. And why the movie sheds no light on Bane's personal life, why he carries a grudge against Gotham, but not against Ducard (Ra's Al Ghul) who excommunicated him from the League of Shadows, and why why Nolan converts him from a gruesome killer to a weakened lover and a mercenary are pathetically unresolved.

The basic flaw with any superhero movie is its end is always predictable, the bad guys lose the good guys win. What make it special are not the visuals or effects, rather its story-line, emotional aspects and the message it carries. The Dark Knight Rises fails in all these categories and I don't know whether the dark knight has risen or not but Nolan has certainly fallen to the level of ordinary.

The Dark Knight Rises is certainly the most awaited disappointment I've faced after Star Wars: The Phantom Menace..."
"Where the last two films in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy played more or less like fairly intimate stories in the Batman universe, this one feels like it's going for the biggest scale it possibly could, with as much destruction and as many thugs as you can fit on screen. The problem here is the unrelentingness of everything that settles in at about the halfway mark. It grows tiring long before the climax kicks in because it's just too much of everything.

Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) has become a recluse and ""Batman"" has gone into hiding for the past 8 years since Harvey Dent's death. After an encounter with a cat burglar, Selena Kyle (Anne Hathaway) and an inspiring speech from his butler Alfred (Michael Caine), Bruce decides he needs to go back out to social events, and begin fighting crime as Batman again. Meanwhile, masked terrorist Bane (Tom Hardy), and a large group of followers take over Gotham city, destroying all ways of leaving or coming in, with the threat of setting off a nuclear bomb located on the island. Meanwhile (yet again), Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) is severely injured by Bane and stuck in the hospital, a new hot head cop John Blake (Joseph Gordon Levitt) is trying to stop Bane through detective work, and Wayne board member Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard) is given control of Wayne Enterprises. Bane massacres Bruce Wayne and throws him into a prison located elsewhere, and it's up to Bruce to summon his strength to try and escape. Meanwhile the criminals take over Gotham and anarchy ensues.

There are a lot of characters here, but they are balanced in their sub-plots quite well. Anne Hathaway gives a really good performance as ""Catwoman"", both hamming it up at times, and also remaining quite subtle when appropriate. Levitt is also a good addition to the cast, as we have a character to care about that is fighting crime, but through detective work and not through being placed in the action like ol' Batman. Having so many main characters was nice to try and avoid repetition, though from the last hour plus, it doesn't work well enough.

The film grows somewhat boring by about the halfway mark. The pace becomes unrelenting, and it's just somewhat of a sensory overload. The editing is quick, the shots are quick, and while stuff is happening and Gotham is about to become a smoldering pit, too much is happening too quickly. And when the villains take over Gotham, you begin thinking of scenarios that would happen with the people of Gotham, and how they would react, but nothing does. They pretty much just go into hiding. Unrealistically, no vigilantes even try to take some of the villains out, but whatever, that's not what the movie is about.

This movie is not above running on many action movie clichés that feel like they belong in lesser pictures. People saving others at the last minute after seemingly coming out of nowhere, and the old everybody else gets killed but the main characters (for no real reason), and then of course many coincidences that happen to effect the outcome of the picture. The same clichés you'd see in a movie like ""Sahara"" from a few years back are prominently used here. Character motives also seem to be slightly off. Why does Batman turn to Catwoman for help exactly? No real logical reason except to pair the two up.

Hans Zimmer's score is effective in driving the action, in that his music here mainly consists of low strings acting almost as drums to move everything along. It drives the action, but at the same time is extremely generic and not very interesting, but it does keep a rhythm going in the action. And unlike Inception, the generic weepy Zimmer music doesn't intrude on scenes that are trying to be emotional. It's a step up from Inception's score in that regard, but is still quite mediocre.

The climax of the film is nice. After all the twists and turns are introduced, it gets down to the heart of the story, and the last ten minutes or so, minus some coincidental and corny moments, are really good and satisfying. For the most part, the conclusion to the film is satisfying and works on an emotional level.

This film concludes the Dark Knight trilogy quite well. It's an imperfect film, with a lot of drag time in the middle of the picture, and just a few too many clichés thrown in, but the ending is mostly very nice, and as a whole, the picture is entertaining, full of action, and enough happens to justify it's nearly three hour length.

My rating: *** out of ****. 165 mins. PG-13 for nonstop action violence."
"Must be something about the bat-signal that causes people to up-rate blindly. This is over-produced, over-storied, and over-acted. Bale is wooden, the Bane character is stupid, the all-fists action is lame... it goes on.

I watched this followed by ""Bloodshot"" (2020). The latter, at a 5.7 rating, is a much better film. Choose it instead."
"In a season filled with big movies that somehow ask even bigger questions, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" feels like the superego to its competition's id. An action opus that manages at to be both viscerally and intellectually engaging, Christopher Nolan's highly anticipated third Batman film comes full circle, examining both the Dark Knight and the society that produced him without sacrificing any of the sweeping thrills for which the series is known. A literate, thoughtful and invigorating finale, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" delivers everything audiences ask for and then some, albeit in fewer of the ways that they might expect."
"No one can deny the unprecedented level of expectation that this film was pressured to live up to. Its predecessor - The Dark Knight not only topped most top movie 10 polls of 2008, but became widely recognised as possibly one of the best films of all time. Notwithstanding that was of course Nolan's interlude movie Inception, which again achieved spectacular feats not only at the box office but critically as well. To say the least, the pressure was on.

But fear not, I assure you this feature will be no disappointment. Set 8 years after the events of The Dark Knight, batman has hung up his cape, took the fall for Harvey Dent's crimes and now lives a solitary life as a recluse - that is until Tom Hardy's Bane causes havoc and promotes anarchy and chaos across Gotham.

One thing is for certain, Nolan has taken no chances with this movie; his script is every bit as clever and well thought out as all the films he has written. Unlike so many of today's superhero movies he doesn't rely on explosions and special effects to move his story from one scene to the other. Also, despite its large cast it doesn't feel as though the big names are fighting for screen time and story-lines unlike the last time Bane was disastrously placed on the big screen in 1997s Batman and Robin. What this movie manages to do which so many blockbusters don't, is balance an edge-of-your-seat action extravaganza with sustaining a level of intelligence that makes it more accessible for those not just looking for a few cheap thrills.

This does not go to say, however, that it does not have its faults. One thing I can honestly say is that while it may just match The Dark Knight, it does by no means beat it. Ledger's Joker was an adversary unrivalled by Hardy's Bane, although praise to in-keeping with the comic's perception of Bane must be noted for not overlooking his intellect or immense strength.

Overall The Dark Knight Rises somehow manages to live up to the high expectations placed on its shoulders. Nolan manages to deliver a film that ticks every box and yet still maintains a distance from the cliché blockbusters Hollywood rolls out every year. The only real question is what will he do next?"
"Seriously, I would put 11 stars if possible. Nolan delivers."
"The defining final chapter in Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy is easily the most ambitious in the trilogy too - an epic, larger than life conclusion to Batman and the city of Gotham, as he rises to the occasion (joke intended *ba dum tst*) to save the city from the menacing reach of Bane and the legacy of the League of Shadows he carries on.

It is somewhat one of the most epic films I've seen. It's a large scale blockbuster, similar to he previous two Nolan Batman films, but with THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, Nolan amps up the scale to an 11, with sets so massive and so viscerally immersive, that it makes the previous two films seem much more smaller. The story still feels very singular and personal despite the amped stakes, but it's such a massive piece of a film.

Where Batman Begins focuses on conquering fear and turning it into a strength, and The Dark Knight focuses on the morality of our actions, The Dark Knight Rises focuses on fallen figures, failed systems and rising from our falls, tying back to Batman Begins' theme of conquering fear and rising from that fall into fear.

For me, this is one of Nolan's best, only behind Interstellar and Inception for me. It's the best comic book film for me, and simply watching it again on a 15/70mm IMAX film print is a totally legendary and unbelievable experience. Seeing the projection on-screen expand onto the full 15/70mm IMAX format, taking on the entirety of the screen is simply swing and with the sound system of the BFI IMAX, it's a truly unparalleled experience; there's really no other experience like watching a Chris Nolan film at the IMAX.

This one is no exception either, being the most epic, massive conclusion to quite literally the best trilogy out there. Christopher Nolan crafted some magical blockbuster, superhero cinema with The Dark Knight Trilogy. It's truly an astoundingly original, inspired and creative vision and direction from Nolan; one that's unprecedented in the realm of superhero films"
This film does not disappoint and it is up to the previous two movies
"And so, after fours years since Batman went on sabbatical after the demise/incarceration of Harvey Dent and The Joker, respectively, Gotham is at one and at peace with itself. Will this peace last? Of course not as the people of Gotham City face their biggest threat yet in the form of thuggish heavy, Bane (Tom Hardy) and his entourage of equally destructive goons. Firstly this movie suffers slightly in cramming too many plot strands into it and the movie is too long as a result. The movie is thoroughly entertaining, nonetheless and Ann Hathaway, as the Catwoman is a surprise in that she's good. Where the film is not as good as the others is that the characterisation so present in the first two, is not there and so actors are wasted (Marion Coutillard and Morgan Freeman). The plot twists may surprise and the effects are jaw dropping but whilst this movie is entertaining, will not last long in the mind."
"He Dark Knight Rises is truly AMAZING

Nolan delivers an incredible conclusion to the greatest trilogy of all time. Great characters and performances, especially by Bale and Hathaway. Also, amazing final battle with an ending which leaves you wondering what really happened"
Best movie ever pretty damn great. Bane is a badass and cool action
Ok well wait...this is the best movie ever. So many plot twists and the ending....THE ENDING... i 100% recommend this movie. RYAN I LOVE THESE MOVIES
"The Dark Knight Rises is what I think the best of Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, where Gotham City faced a new nemesis, a ruthless mercenary called Bane, and learn the truth of Batman after what took place in the events of the previous film, The Dark Knight.

It is a pretty long movie clocking in at 165 minutes; however, the great direction and intriguing screenplay/story made this a very captivating movie, which I believe grasps the audience's attention from beginning to end.

The action sequences were very well choreographed - powerful and realistic. Tom Hardy as Bane's menacing character was given the perfect amount of coldness, generating no sympathy from the audience. Just the part of him and his henchmen attacking a football stadium full of people following a young boy's rendition of A Star-Bangled Banner gave us a very teeth-chattering and chilling feeling.

Anne Hathaway as Catwoman provided much-needed comic relief in this dark film. I loved all her one-liners and acid wit as she dealt with her opponents. She emphasized the ""cat burglar"" role as intended by the comics for Catwoman.

Christian Bale gave a solid performance of Batman. The plot line of him bowing to defeat and then rising to the occasion to save Gotham City was very powerful and moving, reminding people to never give in to his/her adversaries.

In addition, Gary Oldman (Commissioner Gordon), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Blake), Morgan Freeman (Fox) and Michael Caine (Alfred) all shine in their respective roles, giving their own unique approaches in helping Gotham defeat Bane and his mercenaries.

Some of the characters were a little wooden and some of the villains weren't, in my opinion, dealt with properly at the end. Other than those minor downsides, all the elements of drama, action, mystery and humor blended in very well to deliver us what is a very satisfying and entertaining movie to close out the Dark Knight Trilogy.

Grade A-"
"Jan 2022 Although it seemed impossible to follow The Dark Knight this didn't get over shadowed by it but instead gave such a great Finale to a classic series. Again the intro is strong & badass & really builds anticipation for what you're about to watch. Tom Hardy as Bane was perfect & although it seemed impossible to follow The Joker, he did so & definitely is one of the strongest & best villains in any Batman movie. His first fight with Batman was just badass to watch. Michael Caine as Alfred is one of the most underrated performances from the series. Again this has amazing cinematography & plenty of exciting action. I also loved the story of seeing a hero fall then rise. There's a lot of great scenes, one of my favorites is when Gordon realized the Batman is Bruce Wayne."
"This film sorely lacks the depth that The Dark Knight had, but why? Is it because Heath Ledge is no longer in the mix? Maybe. But Nolan seems to have changed the style from its predecessor considerably. It's still dark and gritty, but it has a much greater comic book feel to it than the previous film did.

I'm not bashing comic book movies as they can be entertaining, but the fact that Chris Nolan set out to have a Batman revival that stood apart from other comic book movies, only to have many comic book aspects in his final film detracted from the experience.

The directing is really good, but not Nolan's best, despite some fantastic shots here and there. The acting remains at good as it needs to be, with a pleasant surprise from the charming Anne Hathaway.

What really held this film back for me was how unrealistic and flashy it became. There were too many plot holes to count, with characters seemingly acting without much motivation, some arcs that were less than satisfying, and reveals that could have been handled much better. There's one ""big"" plot twist near the end that, while interesting, did not hold up as well as it should have.

All in all, a good action film in its own right, but one that feels like a let down after the fantastic predecessor."
"The Dark Knight Rises is a pretty good film, though not particularly special. Action was well directed, the new toys are impressive and the storyline is fairly easy to follow.

Bane seemed somewhat overdone - more like a caricature than a deep menacing villain. There was also a noticeable ""dip"" in the middle of the film where I found myself losing interest, mainly due to the plot failing to progress meaningfully. I thought it also drew on connections to the previous films extensively, which doesn't work well and certainly for those who have not seen the first two films.

That doesn't necessarily make it a bad film, but prevents it from being great in its own right. Ultimately it seemed like this installment lacked depth and personality that others had.

It didn't surpass The Dark Knight. Funny to see how many of the actors in Inception turned up in this film."
"I don't understand why all these people are complaining about. It was a really good and well made movie. Some people say that there wasn't enough batman.

there were some technical parts that weren't perfect, yes.

But the whole point of a film Is that it tells a message or puts an idea into your head not just action with nothing but fighting. This film has both elements laid out very well. It wraps the batman trilogy up very nicely. If you haven't seen it I highly recommend it,one of the best movies made. I do sort of wish they made one more follow on to this movie though because coming out of the theaters I kept thinking about the ending and what would happen next."
A magnificent conclusion to round off the trilogy.Christian Bale is arguably the best actor to have become the caped crusader and is brilliant in this must watch.A great story to keep you interested throughout as Bane terrorizes Gotham with Tom Hardy also showing an example of great acting.Other directors should take notes because this is one of the best superhero movies of all time.
"I'm literately speechless, I've never cared that much for superhero movies, seen few of them, but these two movies are definitely worth it, I can see why Nolan took 4 years to release the second one part."
"What a load of rubbish! I can't believe I actually went to see this tripe. It was only because I went with friends (and they all wanted to see it), that I went.

Nearly three hours of utter clap-trap. I didn't understand the story-line, I couldn't tell what the guy with the ""Alien type"" mask over his faced was saying? I couldn't care less about ANY of the characters.. There was no story to it... All of the actors (such as Christian Bale and Michael Caine and Anne Hathaway were obviously just doing it for the money).. Christian Bale should be ashamed as he has done such fine work in his time such as ""The Machinist"" etc.

All that money and THIS is what Hollywood gives us these days!!!! Where are all the GOOD films these days? Where are the ""Schindlers List's""... Where are the ""Empire Of The Sun's"" or ""Eyes Wide Shut"", where are all the arty films such as last years ""The Artist""?? This film was utter rubbish!"
"TDKR was worth the wait and it met my ridiculously high standards. For starters, The Dark Knight is my favorite movie and what I consider to be an instant classic just four years after it's release. Also, Chris Nolan is my favorite director and he never disappoints me. That said, this delivers. The acting, action, cinematography, set designs, costumes, and music are all top notch, and will lead to at least 8 academy nominations come february. There are about 4 or 5 set pieces that are jaw-dropping. Bale and Caine give their best performances of the series and are the heart of the movie. New additions Hardy, Levitt, Hathaway, and Cortillard are all spectacular as you would expect. The main complaint this film has and will continue to receive is that it is ""long"" and ""bloated"". However, the long length and large number of characters gives it an epic and book-like feel. The film really takes its time in telling it's story, whereas some long movies start to rush to the end around the 2 hour mark. While there are a lot of things going on, the story is relatively simple and all of the characters have a good story arc that concludes in a great way. Ending a series is so hard because of the expectations fans build up, whether it is film, television, or books. But this film really does have an ending that should satisfy the majority of fans. This successfully earns the title of best trilogy of all time in my opinion with LOTR close behind. It is that good from beginning to end. Most of all, Nolan decided to take chances with this film when he could have played it too safe. Job well done by Nolan and company. Best Picture and Best Director nomination please."
"It's one of my favorite movies in the trilogy. After years of watching it in the cinema, it's really shocking. It's an exciting moment. There are many times of applause in the audience. The classic movie is still classic."
"i went to this movie with great anticipation....oh mann,for the first time in my life i feel something that cannot be expressed by words...a movie which fulfills my all-time high expectation and provides a maximum. i went to this movie with my friends,we all know that we can expect something different when we go for Christopher Nolans movies because he is among one of the directors who really knows what to do and what the viewer's need,but when he joins with Christian bale,tom hardy,Morgan freeman,Michael Caine & Gary oldman we know how good this film can be... i don't want to spoil anything because this is a movie that you want SEE and not to HEAR.This Batman trilogy shown us how great superhero movies can be.If you really liked the begins and TDK then don't miss it...because later you are gonna regret it....now i am also thinking to see it again...!!"
"With the massacre in Colorado, accompanied by the usual brawls between fans of Marvel and DC on the internet, even with Batman: The Dark Knight Rises (The Dark Knight Rises) debuting a week later in Brazil, little has been seen talking in the film itself.

So here we go: the final installment of director Christopher Nolan trilogy, like its predecessors, is a different kind of comic book adaptation. Yes, comic elements are there, but how they emerge in the plot, watching every sensation, connecting us emotionally to events is more common to dramas and the like.

This time we have a Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) more sentimental, more demanding interpretation of the actor. For years retired from his heroic identity, is forced to wear his uniform again when Gotham City begins to be attacked by thief Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) and the resourceful and dangerous Bane (Tom Hardy).

The scope of all, as one would expect from a conclusion, is greater. For more realistic that the franchise has tried to be, this film comes much closer to the comics with a greater threat, more action, more epic all. It is not uncommon to note elements of famous comic character, as, of course, The Fall of the Bat, but also the Messiah, No Man's Land, The Legacy of Demon and even the classic Batman: The Dark Knight by Frank Miller.

With a somewhat slow start, the movie takes to pick up pace, but when caught, their almost three hours did not seem so much, even more considering the amount of exploited elements. All characters gain their space, some being detailed for the first time, the case of Alfred Michael Caine.

Gary Oldman remains great, stealing the scene whenever possible in the skin of Commissioner Gordon. Lucius Fox Morgan Freeman continues his tirades fun, but this time with much greater participation, including some more serious scenes.

The Bane Tom Hardy recovers the original tone of the character: not just a brute, but someone who plans every move carefully. But it is a point that is being criticized: the voice of the villain, which was unintelligible in the trailers was re-dubbed. Thus, in addition to clearer, became more threatening, but the dubbing was not successful at all times - sometimes there is no sound, even though we realize that the character is speaking and gesturing.

Anne Hathaway gives life to a Catwoman (although she is clearly not called by that nickname) perfect. The character is provocative, entertaining and ambiguous in some extent. The essence of Selina Kyle was found: nothing too tragic origin, special powers or sheer villainy, that's the nicer version of the character in the flesh, one that Catwoman has fun with what he does and transiting between good and evil.

The cop John Blake, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, stands out a lot. The character offers a new perspective on Gotham and its problems at times looking like a middle ground between Batman and Gordon. It until it becomes something even greater.

Being the last film in the series, it is expected that Rises tie the ends. And does it very well. Basically all aspects of mythology are addressed and find some kind of conclusion. And there is room for many surprises along the way. Indeed, the proof that a movie is engaging is when, despite having prior knowledge of rumors and elements already shown in the comics, so busy that we forget all that, surprising us anyway.

Another point that deserves a little criticism is action. When the choice of Bane, it was explained that the idea was to create a physical threat to Batman. But it goes down in combat scenes between the two, who can not afford the epic tone needed thanks to the limitations of movement of the armature of the hero. However, this failure is compensated in many other points, as the agility of Catwoman, this is the movie with more action in the franchise.

The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer remains impressive. Themes that, in isolation, might sound strange and meaningless, placed in certain scenes make everything more epic, and most exciting, contributing to the identity of the characters, without ever leaving aside the issues of the previous films, cleverly ""embedded"" in new compositions.

Batman: The Dark Knight Rises is a remarkable conclusion. The outcome may result in estrangement fans of the characters, but it's always good to remember that this is indeed an end, something that rarely happens for real in comics, or take different paths is only natural in this case. After three great movies, as much as the story has found an end, there is no way deviate from our thoughts more sequels after all the Gotham City created this trilogy still has much to offer, and the outcome leaves us with even more desire to know what might come after."
"""The Dark Knight Rises"" leaves the early days of the superhero genre far behind, and moves into a doom-shrouded, apocalyptic future that seems uncomfortably close to today's headlines. As urban terrorism and class warfare envelop Gotham and its infrastructure is ripped apart, Bruce Wayne emerges reluctantly from years of seclusion in Wayne Manor and faces a soulless villain as powerful as he is. The film begins with many new characters, but it builds to a sensational climax.

Even though The Joker was more of a performance oriented character, that's what he is known for but Bane is more of strength, and Tom Hardy did an amazing job of getting into the shape. Also, I really think this movie had the emotional chord that struck well like Batman Begins. All of these characters and their activities produce a movie that is well acted and thought out.

This is a dark and heavy film; it tests the weight a superhero movie can bear. Christopher Nolan is able to combine civil anarchy, mass destruction and a Batcycle with exercise-ball tires that is remarkable. He does it without using 3D, which is admirable. That much of it was shot in the 70mm IMAX format allows it to make that giant screen its own. It lacks the near-perfection of ""The Dark Knight"" (2008),but it's an honorable finale nonetheless."
"I can say that about one hour into this movie, I was wondering when a superhero movie was going to start or if I had accidentally walked into the wrong theater. I was very disappointed by the lack of action sequences that probably only totaled around 15 minutes out of an almost three hour movie. The Dark Knight was one of my all time favorite movies because it balanced action with great dialog and acting where you never felt ""when is something going to happen?"" The Dark Knight Rises had me feeling that way most of the time. This is supposed to be a superhero movie, not a drama, but that is what this movie is for 80% of the running time. I felt that the action sequences were also anti-climatic and quite boring. If I want to see a movie with loads of great dialog, I'll stick with Tarentino. Lots of dialog isn't always bad, but in this case it became very repetitive and did little to move the story forward. It appeared to me that this movie had the opposite problem that Prometheus had. Way to long for what should've been a 2 hour movie. It just seemed like Nolan wanted to make an epic ending to his trilogy and thought all epic movies MUST be 3 hours long, no matter how much filler there is.

The other disappointment for me was the generic ""bomb in the city"" plot that has been used ad nauseum in action movies for decades. The Dark Knight came up with a very clever plot of turning citizens on each other as the terrorist plot. I was expecting much better from Nolan than this old cliché'. And speaking of cliché's, the hero no longer being able, or wanting to do the job has also been done too many times now as well.

I know many people loved this movie and I'll probably get blasted for this review, but I can honestly say I can't see how anyone thought this installment even compared to The Dark Knight. I took my 14 year old nephew to see it and he felt the exact same way I did. All I'm saying is that if I want to watch a good drama, then I'll go to watch one, but don't try to give me a weak drama wrapped in a superhero movie. When I go see a movie about a comic book hero, there are certain expectations that I have, one of them being there to be at least a good mix of action with dialog. If I knew what this movie was like before hand, I would've waited for it to come out on blu-ray and had skipped this yapfest."
"The Dark Knight Rises

I enjoyed The Dark Knight Rises and believe there were some great things in it. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, (who previously worked with Nolan in 2010's Inception) was a new addition to the franchise and gave a terrific performance as Detective Blake. Marion Cotillard and Anne Hathaway also surprised me with their ability to be action performers. Bane was a bit of a letdown for me. The movie trailers promised so much for his character that just didn't deliver the same showdown we saw with Batman and the Joker. I keep reading about the ""political agenda"" this movie supposedly had, and how it's ""almost impossible for The Dark Knight Rises to meet the level of expectation it had facing it"", but the bottom line is Christopher Nolan redefined the possibilities of the comic book/superhero movie. Even it fell way below fans and critics expectations following the Colorado shooting, it still performed very well and will continue to end on a note that will keep everyone happy. Reviewed by AN/NR 07-20-12"
"Let's face it, the Joker was always the best villain, and it is difficult for any other villain to fill those shoes. I had high expectations for this movie that I think never could be met. There might be other issues I have with this movie that may have been more my mood than how good the story was. There was a sense of too much layering on perhaps a story with too many plot points. Then there is long second act, where Batman takes a leave of absence, where we are required to spend time with our other new characters. Sadly, Michael Caine is missing for most of the film this time around, but at least he handles the heavy stuff really well when he's on screen. Anne Hathaway did not seem like an obvious choice for Catwoman, and frankly I still believe some other actresses could have been more catlike. I have always recognised Hathaway as a capable actress, and find her quite attractive. I just can't buy her being tough, sorry. I thought Commissioner Gordon's character was underwritten in this film. The newcomer that had a lot of stuff to do, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, seemed to be written as a way to connect the dots as the big spectacle is slowly pieced together.

As I patiently waded through all the details of the big city takeover, I was thinking that this feels like a Tom Clancy novel, which spends a great deal of time, sometimes an agonisingly long time, building up to the big spectacle. I felt as long as the details they are throwing at me are plausible, I will go along with it. The thing that was nagging me throughout was Tom Hardy playing the type of villain that looks like a wrestler from WWF. Maybe the Rock. Hardy is just not menacing enough. A big component of The Dark Knight has always been the Hans Zimmer bombastic score, which had some amazing finesse for the 2nd film. Here, there really wasn't any signature theme I could latch on to. In fact, as the third act continued on with a lot of running around, it felt like the score was doing some extra heavy lifting in order to carry the momentum. Sorry to say, but it almost going into Michael Bay territory.

I am still trying to decide how much I liked the finale, and whether it was worth all the buildup. This is where the less you know the better, because frankly that is all the film has going for it. Director Nolan and his screenwriter brother probably talked about resonance when building the character's backgrounds, but they dug a little too deep I think. What they probably felt would be a poignant twist to a main character, turns into something too far fetched (even for a superhero movie). The character's twist could have been something less directly attached to the villain, and slightly more plausible. The places where the film felt a little bloated is when it tried to get political (didn't we all learn that lesson from George Lucas?). There are places where the dialogue concerns stocks and assets and takeovers, and so on. The 2nd film avoided all of that.

I will recommend this film, because as an event film it will be hard to avoid anyway. However, in comparison to the other juggernaut release of summer 2012 - ""The Avengers"", TDKR didn't have a lot of excitement to the plot and a villain that did not match up to other villains."
"The most anticipated movie of the year has arrived, and I'm sorry to say, but at least for this moviegoer, it disappoints. The Dark Knight Rises is such an overly ambitious film that it tries to pack in way more than it can handle. I know I am in the minority here, but by the final hour of the movie all that I really felt was overkill.

This is the capper in Christopher Nolan's trilogy which re-booted the franchise and did indeed make it more respected than it was after the last few Batman films of the 90's. This series has a much darker tone which I always preferred over the lighter fare of other superhero movies like the Spider-Man ones. The dark tone still works well here, but it's hindered by the blown-up storyline. Just as many people observed with Spider-Man 3, there's just too much going on here. It's not that the new characters of Bane and another Catwoman are what bring the film down; it's just that everything is so dragged out in scene after scene. In fact, the re-introduction of Catwoman was one of the things that worked best. I've never been much of a fan of Anne Hathaway, but her scenes were often the best ones. This is a much smarter and slicker Catwoman than we've ever seen before. And that's exactly what you should expect of a character of that name. Maybe a little more of her and less of some other characters would have served the movie well.

Aside from a drawn-out plot about Batman (Christian Bale) being gone for 8 years and Bruce Wayne trying to get his alter-ego mojo back, it seems like the movie tries a little too hard to give ample screen time to all of the other actors as well. It wants to make sure that returning veterans like Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman are properly accounted for along with all the new guys played by Tom Hardy, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Matthew Modine, and Anne Hathaway. This results in many unnecessary scenes in my opinion. There's also a little surprise about one of the characters at the end of the film, but it was something I had already figured out at the beginning. And while the primary villain Bane (played by Tom Hardy) is menacing in his physical appearance, it is a little odd that they chose to give him a voice that sounds like an old geezer from England.

All in all, The Dark Knight Rises was just a bit of a letdown for me. It's not that the expectations were so high that they were hard to live up to, but I actually found this Batman film to be the worst in the trilogy. I have noticed that each one of them has a prolonged climax at the end, but this one seemed 3 times as long and I found myself zoning out while trying to stay interested. At 2 hours and 45 minutes, it really just became a movie loaded with a lot of filler. I mean Malcolm X was 35 minutes longer, yet didn't feel nearly as long as this. There's nothing wrong with a lengthy film as long as each of the scenes are interesting or important to the story. In this case, they were not."
"Christopher Nolan has done it again with the latest Batman movie and has found a way to finish the trilogy. The Dark Knight Rises is an action packed, dark adventure about finding redemption from past events. With sound acting from Levitt and Hatahaway, a well done version of Bane, and some high speed chases, fans will surely not be disappointed. However, for this reviewer the Dark Knight is the better movie of the two. In this movie Nolan has a tendency to make some of the characters idiots when it comes to discovering Batman's identity and a few of his dialogue montages are a poorly timed to be more ridiculous than appreciative.

"I have watched this movie several times, and the last time I watched it, I was still sitting in the edge of my seat! Nolan is a brilliant director who weaves every scene together and makes it look meaningful. Although the movie is well beyond 2.5 hours, there is not a scene in the movie that looks out of place or was just thrown there without meaning. We endured the old 60s styled batman with his cute sidekick Robin. It was silly and stupid and tore batman's legacy apart. Then came the cheap imitations by Val Kilmar and Michael Keaton in the 80s and 90s Batman movies. Seriously, Arnold as Mr.Freeze? Nolan takes Batman back to his dark roots. He injects some realism into the story, reasons what shaped him to become who he became and brings Frank Miller's depiction of the Dark Knight straight out of the comic book into the screen. Nolan's Batman trilogy is masterpiece! And there could not have been a more fitting end to the trilogy. The Joker was awesome, and so is Bane. Go watch it if you haven't. Watch it again if you have!"
"If I could have had a personal conversation with Christopher Nolan and asked him to make the Batman movie that I wanted to see then it would have looked exactly like The Dark Knight Rises. I'm going to be up front about this right now, this review is going to be the work of a gushing fan boy because The Dark Knight Rises is perfect. When we last saw Christian Bale's Batman he was fleeing on the batpod from the Gotham authorities after taking the blame for Harvey Dent's death in order to preserve the greater good. Now it's five years later and Gotham is a nicer place to live but all that may be about to change with the arrival of the mercenary Bane. This happens to coincide with Bruce Wayne's first meeting with cat-like jewel thief, Selina Kyle which stirs him from the solitude he's been living in. The overall theme of The Dark Knight Rises harks back to the advice given to the young Bruce Wayne by his father in Batman Begins - ""Why do we fall? So we can learn how to get back up."" That is essentially what Bruce Wayne is doing in this film, getting back up and while Bale is just as good as he was in the previous two films, TDKR feels much more like an ensemble piece. Newcomers Joseph Gordon Levitt, Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle, Marion Couttliord and Tom Hardy as Bane all help to make this a movie on a grand scale. The real surprise here is Anne Hathaway. She makes the role of Selina Kyle/Catwoman her own, much as Heath Ledger did The Joker. Chris Nolan has packed the films long run time with enough action sequences to rival the truck chase from The Dark Knight. He is a director with a perfect vision for this kind of thing and the expertise to put it on screen in the most mesmerising way imaginable. And yet it's cast and action are not The Dark Knight Rises trump card. The script is stuffed with such emotion and chills moments that by the end the effect is overwhelming. A film which leaves it's viewer stunned, shocked, awe stricken and in no doubt that they have witnessed something extremely special indeed. It will be a long time before a film comes along that is as good as The Dark Knight Rises. I'm not sure that most folk could handle watching anything quite so good so often. This is life-affirming film making of legendary status."
"The last chapter of Nolan's Batman trilogy is phemomenal, remarkable, fun, with solid performances and the freshness and criativity you expect in a Nolan film. Unfortunely, it's so underappreciated. The end of a art work, books and films and other narrative media can be challenging, and many fail, but Nolan nailed it in this one. I know it has its mistakes, but the film delivered what it proposed, and it delivered gloriously.

The score of Hans Zimmer, so memorable, elevates the film and without it the film would lose half of its magic. Bane is iconic, when you stop to think about this film, Bane will be the first thing that you will remember, and part of the charm is his voice, Tom Hardy is great here. Batman of course is great here, his fall and his rise were done in a magnificent way. There's so much good things here, the directing, cinematography, I watched with the IMAX ratio and it was fantastic. The opening, the first fight between Bane and Batman. Everything here is so greatly done. It was the ending this trilogy deserved and needed."
"I am not going to bore you with a long drawn out comment about the film. Being this is my first I would like to have my opinion heard. IMO the first two movies were far better than the finale. Bane was a good villain, and well played I might add, and the storyline tied in nicely with the first two. However, Catwoman was there for what exactly? Apart from being a love interest (neither had any on screen chemistry any way) I can't work out why she was there other than eye candy. To avoid spoilers all together lets just say there are some questionable events that go on in the movie. I must say I left the theater a little disappointed (mainly due to how good everyone had said it was). Go into the film expecting a nice wrap up to what was a fine trilogy by Nolen. But don't expect to see a perfect movie like the people who voted 9's and 10's because it is far from it. Keep your expectations in check and you will no doubt enjoy The Dark Knight Rises."
"This movie reminded me a lot of watching a transformer movie. There was almost no plot, horrible acting, and overblown, unrealistic action scenes. It was as if Nolan thought by having constant action, it would be a great movie. He was dead wrong. The villain in the movie, Bain, was the worst bad guy I have ever seen. He was a bad actor, extremely hard to understand at times, and added little to the movie. In my opinion, all of the acting was atrocious. Furthermore, I know it's a batman movie but I've never seen a movie that consistently had so many unrealistic aspects. I don't want to give away anything, but over and over again the most ridiculous incidents and scenes occurred. It was almost like a 12 year old with no sense of anything realistic wrote the movie. By far the worst Nolan movie I have ever seen. It's truly a shame the third part of the trilogy was so poorly written, filmed, edited, and directed. I don't know how anyone could rate this movie a 10. I went inwith low expectations because the first Dark Knight was so good and I knew this one would not be nearly as good. The movie didn't ever meet my meager expectations. It was truly awful, not even worth the price of admission."
"Christopher Nolan has outdone himself with this one. At 3.30 in the morning, I was tired. Just getting out of it, I've never been so awake.

Batman tries to force Bane to reveal the location of the trigger device, Miranda suddenly stabs him in the side. The bomb detonates in the ocean and gotham is saved!

I suppose at this point, I have to turn my focus on Nolan. If he ever reads this... aspiring filmmaker to filmmaker, I've never been so envious, jealous in all my life. It's a film that leaves me floundering, wondering what I could possibly do to get anywhere near this ballpark. Well done. I think an Oscar Nomination is in order.

From here, I'm not sure what to expect of the future. Does our imagination carry us forward, or do the studios? Time will tell.

10/10"
"This is a strong and satisfying end to the Nolan Batman trilogy. While The Dark Knight was more complex, more intellectually impressive, and The Joker was a more intimidating villain, I thought this movie did better with cohesion, evenness of pacing, and overall felt like a return to the neatly packaged story of Batman Begins. In fact, with the number of parallels the story and visuals had to the first film were almost *too* on the nose, but I think it still worked (but did we really need that a whole flock of bats *and* the shot of Bruce Wayne's father coming to rescue him? Also, what was up with Qui-Gon Jinn's force ghost randomly appearing??). The cast was once again a solid positive for this movie. Hardy's Bane, while far less impressive and a little more cartoonish than Heath Ledger's The Joker, served his purpose. Oldman continued to do a great job and Gordon-Levitt was a nice addition to the cast. Morgan Freeman was sidelined once again, though, leaving this cast blindingly white except for a few background characters who die. However, this cast also had a significant improvement over the previous two instalments in the trilogy: While the death of Rachel Dawes may have left Gotham woman-less at the end of The Dark Knight, both Hathaway's Catwoman and Cotillard's Miranda Tate were strong characters who were prominent throughout the movie and important to the plot. Could they have been a little better in their execution? Yes, although they were handicapped from being introduced for the first time in this movie compared to the men, and I thought the two added much needed balance to the cast's diversity as well as its motivations.

There was more heart in this than the previous two films, and it leaned into its emotional beats particularly in the ending. I would have liked more emotion throughout the series, and in contrast to the rest of this series the epilogue felt a little bit cheesy. Still, though, maybe that's okay. This movie did its best to earn the heartstring-pulls at the end, and it was certainly an emotionally satisfying and uplifting end to the trilogy."
"After the tremendous success ""Batman Begins"", and then the phenomenon that was ""The Dark Knight"". Christopher Nolan caps off his trilogy of his Batman legacy with absolute finesse and truly masterful filmmaking and storytelling with ""The Dark Knight Rises.""Again, what Nolan has done with TDKR is purely beautiful and tragic at the same time. I don't need to mention how excellent his casting choices are and always will be, but Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle/Catwoman was superb. Felt a lot more in sync with the comic book renditions as well as the recent taking of her character in Rocksteady's latest Batman Title ""Arkham City."" Hathaway uses seductive tactics to get what she wants and does so with flying colours. Her performance is both natural and breathtaking all at the same time as she provides her own sub plot that I, as a viewer felt just as interested in. Enter in Tom Hardy and we finally have a villain who is physically intimidating to a extreme level (but lets us never take away the riveting fear that Heath Ledger injected into us as viewers as the Joker RIP) Joseph Gordon-Levitt was an excellent addition to the plot, and very much worthy of his new title. The remainder of the cast is flawless; from Freeman to Caine and then of course to Bale the film creates a power house cast and allocates the screen time honourably. The most spectacular farewell to the most well done comic book to film adaptation to ever be brought to the silver screen. The final moment leaves you with closure, comfort and true appreciation for the ending of an excellent era in Batman. I have one last thing to say and that is; Bravo Christopher Nolan, Bravo indeed."
"Is it bright where you are / Have the people changed / Does it make you happy you're so strange / And in your darkest hour, / I hold secret's flame / You can watch the world devoured in its pain

So go the lyrics to Smashing Pumpkins' The End is the Beginning Is the End, from 1997's Batman and Robin. It seems at least a little ironic that a song from the worst Batman film ever made seems to sum up the plot of what is possibly the best Batman film ever made. Christopher Nolan, his brother Jonathan, wife and producer Emma Thomas, co-plotter David S Goyer and their whole production posse seem to have had a Sisyphean task thrust upon them in topping 2008's The Dark Knight, widely hailed as the best comic book-based film ever made and having bragging rights as the only Batman film that won an Academy Award in an acting category. Laconically put, they have. They have made a Batman film better than The Dark Knight.

Nolan has said that he and his brother were inspired by Dickens' classic story A Tale of Two Cities, and that it just so happened that the recession and the ""Occupy Wall Street"" movement occurred, so if he is to be believed, it is partial coincidence that this is a very, very timely story. Bane's role in the story is that of zealous liberator who sees himself as a saviour who ""frees"" Gotham from the clutches of the 1% by ambushing the stock exchange, isolating Gotham City from the country at large and seizing control through intimidation and bravado. There are many parallels to be drawn to such events as the Hurricane Katrina aftermath, the 9/11 attacks and the Oklahoma City bombing. This is also echoed by the characterisation of Catwoman, who steals from the rich not to give to the poor, but rather to spite the rich. Bane launches an attack on a sports stadium right after ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" is sung, and there is a shot of a tattered American flag. A city's resolve broken, with Batman and his allies stepping in to patch it up in the face of insurmountable odds.

While no one actor in the film matches the tour de force of the late Heath Ledger's turn as the Joker in the previous installment, the overall effect of this film certainly carries more impact. For one, it follows a solid plot line and doesn't lapse into false endings the way The Dark Knight sometimes did. Some felt that Nolan might fall into the trap of a tangled web of subplots and extraneous villains along the lines of Spider-Man 3, but it is safe to say he didn't.

The big thing this one does that Part 2 didn't was it ties back to the previous instalments, making character arcs come full circle in a deeply satisfying manner. Also, it is more faithful to the source material than one might think; this isn't merely a war movie with Batman characters tacked onto it. There are some explosive plot twists and revelations – comic book devotees may see these coming a mile away, but Nolan plays a game of ""maybe I will, maybe I won't"", so that when such turning points occur they are truly sensational.

Compared to other villains who have appeared in Batman films, Bane is a relatively recent introduction in the comics, having made his debut in 1993. Tom Hardy does quite the job of making Bane more than Batman's mental and physical match. Even withhHalf his face obscured by a mask that is a cross between an attack dog's muzzle and venomous spider, the actor still manages to be charismatic and larger-than-life while displaying commendable restraint.

Despite being widely lauded for his strengths as a writer-director, Christopher Nolan's Achilles heel is widely regarded to be writing women. He breaks that spell with Catwoman, her characterisation damn near perfect and portrayed with very surprising skill by Anne Hathaway who transforms from kooky sweetheart to confident, self-assured, oh-so-seductive and quick with a scathing remark. Marion Cotillard fulfils the more traditional damsel-in-a-degree-of-distress role, her Miranda Tate kind and disarming, and it is easy to see why Bruce Wayne would fall headlong for her.

Beyond the story and performances, The Dark Knight Rises looks, sounds and feels like the event it is touted to be. Cinematographer Wally Pfister throws in some very inventive shots, including a brief moment where a charging Batman is lit by muzzle flashes, and delivers dizzyingly gorgeous panoramas as well. Chris Corbould and his practical effects crew help stage several awe-inspiring action set-pieces, and the tone is set well with an opening scene involving a staged plane crash orchestrated by Bane. There is a level of admiration to be had when a film fits a massive brawl shot on Wall Street, the Mehrangarh Fort in Jodhpur, India and a terrorist attack on a football stadium (Pittsburgh's Heinz Field) into one movie.

Christopher Nolan and co. have brought the curtain down on their trilogy in truly bittersweet fashion. These three films were emblematic of The Dark Knight rising, rising from an outrageously campy, seemingly franchise-killing film. This is the final cape flourish, the big send-off, the tearful goodbye. As Dickens wrote in the book that partially inspired this movie, ""it was the best of times, it was the worst of times"" – this is the Caped Crusader's finest hour, and seeing this incarnation hang up the cape and cowl is quite saddening indeed."
"Well last night I went to a screening of Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and finally The Dark Knight Rises! I have been a batman fan ever since 2007. My room is covered in Heath Ledgers signature pieces from The Dark Knight, I have over 10,000 comic books, all the movies from DC Comics up to date, my bed is covered in batman and I have statues, action figures and so on.

The Dark Knight Rises was amazing, I laughed, I cried, my jaw dropped after seeing characters such as Holly Robinson appear (even though I knew that she would be in the movie) and at the had to contain myself other was I would of made a complete fool of myself for cheering. The Dark Knight Rises is the best! Now there are a lot of things I can spoil for you but I wont. First off though:

BEFORE SEEING THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, DO SOME RESEARCH OF CHARACTERS SUCH AS A GUY NAMED ROLAND DAGGET, THE MARONIE CRIME FAMILY, HOLLIE ROBINSON, RAs AL GHUL AND THE LEAGUE OF SHADOWS OTHER WAS You'll BE LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE THERE THAT FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE MOVIE ENDED UP TEXTING ON THEIR MOBILE, FALLING ASLEEP OR WALKING OUT FOR HALF OF IT! The movie is a cross between two famous stories from the DC Universe. These stores are named Batman Knightfall (the story of Bane) and Batman No Mans Land

Do what I did and watch Batman Begins and The Dark Knight right before you see it because they all lead into one another. The movie though had me right off my seat from start to end and it was great! To be honest better than the Avengers.

When you see the ending you'll probably be as shocked as I was and also CHRIS NOLAN LIED TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING (wont tell you what it is). Im going to go see this movie again tomorrow and am so pumped!"
"For some reason this film is completely missing the distinctive Nolan touches of finesse pacing and emotional involvement that made the previous DK episodes classics.

It all just felt a looked a bit B-movie ish. The bat vehicles looked like cardboard mock-ups, the ""guns"" visibly wobbled about and on the bat bike the effect is bordering on comical. The tank gun muzzle flashes had that kind of sparkly effect that was state of the art in about uuh 1985. The main fight scenes lacked any sense of tension or intensity. The bad guys/girls lacked any real menace. The plot was poorly paced.

The presence of the top rank actors like Freeman Caine and Oldman only served to make these shortcomings more noticeable and discordant. Think Terminator 3 - its basically a B movie riding on the coat tails of its predecessors."
"I was thinking of one thing when i was travailing to go and see The Dark Knight Rises- Will it live up to my expectations? And the answer to this is very simple- No, it went beyond my expectations. This film is simply a masterpiece. I love everything about it, the acting is amazing, the writing is amazing, the story is amazing, the characters are amazing, the fights and effects are amazing, the music is amazing, is is all amazing. I will not put spoilers in this review. Lets start out with who the best character is in my opinion, this may sound corny but to me it is Bruce Wayne, the story revolves around him and his demons when it comes to the batman, the conversations he has with Alfred are so good that it makes you feel what trauma he is going through and how in some strange way he can't be batman or he will die... soon. The villain Bane is incredibly menacing with an almighty stance and a terrifying voice, and if you hear anyone saying his motivation is unclear, do not believe them. His motivation is revealed near the end of the film and it is truly great. The film does a great thing by linking more things back to Batman Begins rather then The Dark Knight, don't get me wrong i love The Dark Knight, but the psychological aspect of Batman Begins is really good, and having the final film in the trilogy go back to its roots is a great idea. Catwoman is ported by Anne Hathaway brilliantly in this film, she does a great ob from switching from scared and frightened to a bad ass who could easily beat her wait out of her situation, Since she is running from Bane, we do get to see the character as something new- scared, not wimpy scared but silently scared as she knows who and what Bane is, and she will do anything go get away from him, and there is a little spark between Batman and Catwoman. The Story is everything people could want- dark, intense, cool, action packed, psychological and thats to name a few. To sum up. This film is a masterpiece, and it shows what can be achieved with fantastic writing, directing, acting, music and setup, this film took a long time to come out but believe me it is worth the wait. This is my all time favourite of the Dark Knight Trilogy. And it is one of my all time favourite films. Go and see this film people, and witness the Rise of The Dark Knight."
"I was a bit skeptical about the film mostly because the majority of prequels do awfully terrible. But I was shocked when I saw the trailers because in the eyes of the previews, the film looked AMAZING! When I discovered which comic books the film's plot is based on, my anticipation grew! When I finally sat down in the theater at the midnight premiere and finally saw the film after waiting four years, I was shocked on how AMAZING it was put together and how big the size and scale was. It was phenomenal to see most of the film shot in 70mm IMAX and to see NYC as a stand in for Gotham City.

The casting selection was phenomenal and Tom Hardy brings Bane to a very menacing and realistic approach. The musical score (once again composed by Hans Zimmer) was incredible and introduced a bit of new themes, but still stayed true to the score from both BB & TDK.

As for the film's storyline, I felt it was very well crafted together! I liked how they have great continuity with the ending of TDK. The storyline overall was really good, and they did an awesome job with bringing it full circle and bringing it to a final conclusion.

Great job to Christopher Nolan as well as the cast and crew for delivering the BEST Batman trilogy ever made!"
"Trilogies can be a dangerous area to play with, especially with a series that is already hailed for its direction. But Christopher Nolan enters this zone with ""The Dark Knight Rises"" after the phenomenal success of his previous adaptation of the Batman figure, ""The Dark Knight"". With such hype and public following backing up this production is it worth the risk? To jeopardize you're recognition for re-inventing the superhero movie just for a few extra dollars? A series that has pushed the limits of this universe to the brink? In this case of Nolan's direction with this film, the answer is yes and he does the impossible with ease.

The events of this story take place 8 years after ""The Dark Knight"" where the mysterious, yet ruthless Bane enters Gotham City setting off a chain of events that forces Bruce Wayne to don the bat suit again and protect the city for the injustice that is being served. Along side this is an array of new characters that propel the plot while also creating an emotional resonance within. Joseph-Gordon Levitt plays the rookie, idealistic cop John Blake with such enthusiasm and depth that makes for an instantly relatable bond between the audience and the screen. Adding to the already stellar cast is two strong, independent female leads. Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard), a recent addition to the Wayne Enterprise who creates a connection with Bruce Wayne, and the slick, yet sexy Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), a Robin Hood esque vigilante that lives away from the rich and luxurious world that most of our characters live amongst.

Showing the way Selina Kyle lives opens up to some of the themes that are a large concept in this essentially extravagant, epic summer blockbuster. Class crisis plays a large part as the rich have become powerful and the poor are becoming desperate. It's a contrast to our economic climate making this film more relevant than it initially appears. Metaphorically showing how people stand up to oppression and create anarchy is achieved through visually stunning set pieces, intertwining ideas and action into a competent mix. These ideas are there if you're looking for some contextual backbone, but not necessary for you to fully dissect.

By grounding the series to reality Nolan has essentially created art house films with his Batman realizations, mixing ideas with spectacle against a visually independent backdrop. The colour tones that filter the screen play against the mood of the characters and Wally Pfister's cinematography turns the epic scale all the way up to 11, while still making the low key and character filled scenes visually exciting. The direction is superb, managing to juggle the variety of characters on display giving them all the depth and development they all deserve. Managing to create this level of emotional engagement against a numerous amount of set pieces is a hard feat but the film is paced as the roller-coaster ride it is, taking the necessary twists and turns the plot decides to venture towards.

The series has built up to this epic conclusion in a film that feels entirely relevant and a director's work, instead of a studios decision. The level of spectacle on display is phenomenal giving the modern day film going the price of his admission plus more. The film takes the best parts of the previous installments and throws them into a circumstance that makes the last Harry Potter film look like child's play. The places the film goes are so unexpected and breathtaking that it's hard not to be amazed and fall in love with superhero films all over again. ""The Avengers"" may have created a visually exciting and enjoyable romp of a film, but ""The Dark Knight Rises"" manages to take those positives and attach a real sense of weight and peril to the situation. Though the story is primarily Bruce Wayne's and how he must rise to protect everything he holds close, it's just as much as the city of Gotham's film. You feel the danger; you feel the stakes, which is something that we haven't felt within a film of this caliber for a long time. With Hanz Zimmer score adding to the levels the film is escalating towards branded together with a phenomenal sound design making sure you feel every explosion, punch and gunshot it's hard not to feel the inner child within yourself trying to break free.

We've come along way over the last decade with superhero films. The idea of a comic book playing out as a motion picture has traveled so far and ventured to every corner of the spectrum that it's lacking the one thing that made them so special in the first place spectacle. We've been treated to awe of seeing our beloved characters jump to the big screen but how it all plays out rarely changes. Christopher Nolan is the game changer though, in his 164 minute epic ""The Dark Knight Rises"" we journey to those points and clichés we've grown up with merely to push past them, break them, entering a film that we are unlikely to see the likes of again or at least for a very long time. There may be the odd contrived moment but for a film on this scale they are easy to let go and are overshadowed. This is a dark; emotionally draining experience expertly crafted alongside beautifully staged action set pieces but it's a ride and it's certainly one that deserves to be taken."
"I love the new Batman trilogy. Liam Neeson is awesome. And Bale is a GREAT Batman. I actually haven't seen the movie but I have heard nothing but great things. I just had a question for IMDb users. Does anyone know if they will make more Batman movies. I would love to see someone other than Jim Carey play The Riddler. That character has so much potential.They really messed up with the last one. No offense, just in my opinion I think someone (maybe L.DiCaprio) could really do something with it. Another villain that would be fun is Mr. Freeze and Ivy. Also, maybe make a non-fruity Robin. Robin has so much potential to kick some booty. Have him be someone awesome. Well, just throwing some ideas out there. sorry this isn't a real review guys, just had some questions.

Thanks. -AP6"
"The Dark Knight Rises, The third and last part of an amazing trilogy.

BOM! the music is brilliant, I love that last second when the movie theater experience that last ""BOM"" and the big screen showing ""The Dark Knight Rises"" and you know this is it, this is the end of an fantastic trilogy.

In the beginning of the movie, Bruce Wayne or Batman has not been seen since that night 8 years ago, the night of Harveys death, but when a masked man starts to move around in Gotham, it's also time for Bruce Wayne to put the mask on again.

For the last part Nolan decided that Bane is the final villain. Bane who challenges Batman both mentally and physically, which makes the choice of villain obvious to the final part of the trilogy,also a smart choice of actor to play the muscle monsters. Tom Hardy! Tom Hardy got a tough challenge with the role of Bane, I mean the bar was set pretty high when Heath Ledger did a extraordinary performance as The Joker in ""The Dark Knight"" But can you really do Bane so much better? The way he talks, walks and fights, Tom Hardy is perfect for the role of Bane.

And as we know from the two previous movies Christian Bale does a fantastic performance as Bruce Wayne/Batman.

Yeah, actually I'm very pleased with all the actors, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, and so on.

Bane is presented early in the film, in a very big scene in the air where his plan is to ""crashing this plane, with no survivors"" and from there you know what Batman will face.

A fantastic trilogy deserves a fantastic ending.

Thanks Nolan!"
"Firstly, most of us (if not all of us), have gone (or, are about to go) in, to watch this movie with a lot of expectations. And, after a movie as exhilarating as the Dark Knight, we cannot be blamed for these (over) expectations from TDKR. We are bound to draw comparisons between the second installment and this Grand finale that we expect it to be. And this is exactly, what I felt was unfair to the makers. When I went to watch TDKR, I expected it to have a lot of things, either as good as, or better 'than the Dark Knight'. I could never think of TDKR without thinking about the Dark Knight. And in this unfair comparison process, I missed out on the true essence of TDKR. And despite my obscurity, the movie still blew me away with an ending that is befitting to a series (in fact, the only batman movie series) that immortalized a legendary hero like Batman. In spite of being a tat disappointed for ""not being as good as the Dark Knight"", I could (like most others), notice the outstanding performances in the movie, notably, Christian Bale, Michael Kane and Anne Hathaway. I could not still help but cheer like a kid at every appearance of the Gotham city's savior. Having said that, I still felt let down. But the fact is that I still would have rated the movie a 7 out of 10.

And then I had to go watch it a second time with my parents and my gal friend and boy am I glad I did! This time around, I watched the movie as the third part, that it is, and not as Dark knight PART 2, as most of us subconsciously, unknowingly and unfairly want it to be. And I realized that the movie has a very strong story line and invokes the right emotions. some of the scenes in the movie were so emotionally exciting that I felt like standing up and clapping. The connection to the other parts was very well scripted. The characters, well developed, the execution of the script, immaculate, the dialogues, deep. The movie had an emotion attached to it. The action scenes were fantastic.

This movie is all about the Batman, his character and his legend. As far as I'm concerned, Christian Bale has immortalized the Batman just like Ledger did the Joker. I walked out of the theater overwhelmed and sad at the same time. Sad about the fact that this would be the last installment under Christopher Nolan's direction. There is no debating the fact that Michael Kane is a brilliant actor, and once again, he proves why he is one. I did not expect much from Anne Hathaway and boy! was I in for a surprise. And about the ending, I could not emphasize enough about how blown away I was!! Nolan is a true a genius!!

So, there is, my first movie review. I believe TDKR is an outstanding movie that is crumbling under the unreasonable expectations of the audience and unnecessary comparisons to the second part. PLEASE DO NOT COMPARE TDKR to the DARK KNIGHT. These are two different animals and The Dark Knight Rises is an outstanding movie that would leave you in awe, if only you are willing to watch it and enjoy it without being presumptuous."
"Eight years after the events of ""The Dark Knight"", Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale, aka Batman) must once again come to Gotham City's aid as a crazed masked terrorist known as Bane (Tom Hardy) terrorizes anyone and everyone in his demented path. A seductive cat burglar (Anne Hathaway) is also along for the maddening ride as biblical-styled destruction, atomic warfare, and even stock market tampering turn out to the most devastating orders for the day. Long, winding, and ultimately towering installment in co-writer/director Christopher Nolan's new-age ""Batman"" trilogy is a triumph of vivid characterizations, advanced-styled story-telling principles, and wonderful technicalities such as cinematography, editing, sound, and visual effects. Joseph Gordon-Levitt shines as a good cop caught up in the chaos; the same can be said for new love interest Marion Cotillard who makes an impression as an associate to Bale's Wayne Industries. Traditional standouts Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman also add well-timed and effective roles for the production's nearly three-hour running time. Once again, a great accomplishment of style, flair, and dynamics in a tightly-wound cinematic product which blends and meshes in well with its two predecessors of the dominant trilogy. 5 stars out of 5."
"How I would grade this movie... Character's A, Plot B, overall C.

I really felt the movie was drawn out far too long. The budget was obviously very good. That being said, I wish they would have spent just a little more and hired someone who knew a little about physics. Mainly with the design of Batman's vehicles, that guy should have been fired! Ridiculous to say the least! I was face palming through the movie on this.

Speeding up fight scenes is something I would expect from the 99 cent bin at walmart not a blockbuster movie.

Though no one stood up to Heath Ledger's role in the last film, the character in this one were great! All in all, I wish I would have waited to see this at home. I will say that the movie ended well."
"You might see the film and think this is the greatest film ever. I am glad for you. But I recall what Batman comics were, and I recall what good films were, and this film was very disappointing. Good, but not great.

I saw it on the first day of release, but I delayed in writing this comment because I wanted to think it over.

Obviously, to call this film the third in a trilogy, there was a need to relate it to the two previous films, and to seem to tie the films together. I thought such tying was extremely forced and contrived. The various plot twists (which I won't reveal) were exciting and believable, but the enormous amount of ""backstory"" added to tie everything together seemed to me to be totally contrived.

Does anyone remember when Batman was fun and campy? Did anyone think that Adam West was going to have a dark (k)night of the soul? Does anyone recall why Tim Burton's Batman films were so much fun? There is an absolutely excruciating fifteen minutes or so in the middle of this film that I'd like never to experience again. Brutal and depressing. (My complaint is not about the acting or direction. Just the idea.) But after Chris Nolan got beyond the need to ""tie up"" the trilogy, the ending of the film was satisfactory (even though it did not foreclose the possibility of further sequels.) The ending went far toward redeeming the misery of the middle.

The film should be seen, without a doubt. Just don't plan to have a lot of fun."
"Wow !! How can a superhero movie be so real yet amazing !! Well you should not doubt when it's made by Christopher Nolan. Chris is now the third name in my list after James Cameron and Steven Spielberg. The Dark Knight Rises is a real dark movie with a very strong message,""Anybody can be hero"". It's very sad that Christopher Nolan ended the series but this trilogy had been the best superhero trilogy till date. Christian Bale did a great job, both as Batman and Bruce Wayne and will remain the best Batman ever. Anne Hathway looked pretty hot as Catwoman and showed her some really good acting skills. Tom Hardy appeared huge and perfect as Bane. Rest all did a wonderful and flawless job. This flick is a must watch before you die. MINDBLOWING..."
"The Dark Knight set the bar high and beyond reach for any and all superhero films that were to follow in it's grand and intricately indulgent wake, including it's follow up, The Dark Knight Rises.

I'm very happy, then, that The Dark Knight Rises measures up to the standard that The Dark Knight set.

From the opening sequence you get the sense that Christopher Nolan understands the epic proportions he must strive to achieve in order to top off what is surely a spectacle of an ending to a fine trilogy.

The action is so intense and regular that the nearly 3 hour long running time breezes by effortlessly. But the action isn't the only highlight in the film, not to say it isn't spectacular, but the performances of Tom Hardy, and surprisingly Anne Hathaway add much weight and vibrant energy to the film.

Christian Bale is more Bruce Wayne than Batman in this movie and I found that refreshing. We see him at his weakest, his most vulnerable, and that makes you root for him much more. There is one key scene involving Bruce ""Rising"" , that's all I'll say, and the crowd I saw it with were cheering and yelling for him. Priceless scene.

Even though the The Dark Knight Rises is epic on the action scale, I felt it wasn't as Dark or complex as The Dark Knight, which is my only gripe. I was expecting a more mentally taxing film, but that could be a positive considering Batman is an action hero.

There are a few nice surprises and twists that are sure to excite many fans as well.

I give it a 9/10. I would of given it a 10 if the ending hadn't left me wanting more.

The Dark Knight Rises is a must see."
"Well, it's apparent that the full con job is on to save face by the fanboys and to save the box office by the studio. Those of us that actually have seen this film know the truth. It's a dull and diminished film not worthy of any real praise at all.

So we have to ask, what the hell happened? Were we expecting too much? It's simply too cool and remote for its own good and it's dragged down by fractured development and a split focus. Add an over-satisfied and overlong delivery that can numb the viewer and TDKR is hardly the alleged masterpiece that all the fans have conned themselves in to believing that it is. This forgets the better quality of TDK and reverts back to below Batman Begins levels. Bale makes a slick Bruce Wayne but a stiff and unconvincing Batman yet again.

I know the following statement of FACT will upset the many Nolanophiles that post here but TDKR is an average film at best. Anyone that says otherwise is just fooling themselves. They would rave about The Dark Knight Rises regardless of quality. To them, Nolan could have filmed Bale pooping in a pot for an hour and they would deem the footage to be Oscar level. Delusional fans aside, it's becoming quite clear that The Dark Knight Rises is getting some praise because people remember TDK fondly. As a result, all the hype and praise will lead to an incredible box office and curiosity factor. Since TDKR doesn't suck, (it's merely average) no one is going to speak out against it and the curiosity factor will garner it even more money and fake praise. The WB knows it has a can't miss on their hands regardless of the lack of quality.

Sad to say, Dark Knight Rises falls flat. In summer that's been very good so far it was average to the point of tedium. The choppy action offers nothing we haven't seen before. Most of the time, the viewer is ""treated"" to a dark pondering film setting up a villain that can't come close to following Heath Ledger's Joker. It also sets up an alternate character in Catwoman that feels more tacked on then extra make-up at a brothel. It's a drawn out plot that this movie just didn't need. It certainly isn't as bad as the Batman & Robin days but it's also not half as good as other, more complete comic adaptations. Anyone saying otherwise is again flat out lying either to you or to themselves.

I truly think that some die-hard fans are so fooled by there own limited views and the the fact that they NEED this to be good that they really think this thing is a great film. The sad thing is that they really believe that nonsense. More's the pity. Apparently, they'd rather lie to both you and to themselves."
"I am a huge fan of Christopher Nolan and must say he hasn't made a weak movie. While the first two episodes of the Batman trilogy were exceptional, this final instalment was, for me, the weakest ... though still good. The standouts in the cast were Anne Hathaway and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Tom Hardy's a wonderful actor but his garbled and muffled dialogue was at times quite unintelligible - almost making Batman's low drone more tolerable. Nolan and his brother are brilliant screenwriters but I found this storyline full of plot holes and generally obvious in development(certainly expected in fantastical super-hero films). My favourites among Nolan's many excellent films remain Following and Memento, proof that he doesn't need to only make 9 digit budget films from here on in. The story is most important and a great one doesn't always require an expensive wealth of action, CGI and special effects."
"Whats with all the high ratings... Story was terrible. how can 1000 unarmed cops walk towards the bad guys with guns up an alleyway and not get shot then just start fighting. I fell asleep through this and was dis-appointed with all the hype. Can you trust reviews anymore, I'm not sure.

The Dark Knight was very good - i loved it. But this was so bad. Felt tricked at paying to watch this and felt so angry. Batman gets his ass kicked in a fight, then goes away and does a few sit-ups and come back like superman. Batman gets stabbed with a 2inch knife and nearly dies yet he got bullets bouncing of him through the film"
"Batman Begins was a milestone in its own right. The Dark Knight was one of the best experiences ever created in the history of cinema. It had everything: from superb acting and script to phenomenal direction and special effects. To be the first and only superhero movie to actually identify with an audience was truly a remarkable achievement. Not only did it bring alive the fantasy of comic books, but it engaged viewers in such a way that we were compelled to be immersed in the fantasy world as if it were reality. It managed to grasp the idea of childish comic books so well, but yet also evolved it into a mature movie.

In order for the latest instalment, The Dark Knight Rises (TDKR), to be on par with the original Dark Knight (TDK), it would have required a miracle. The trailers from months ago always managed to put a chill down my spine, but I always questioned whether it could reach the same level of greatness as TDK did.

I immensely enjoyed TDKR. I won't make much comparison with TDK yet, but I will say this. One of the most fascinating elements of TDK was to actually end the movie in ""darkness."" Batman sacrificed his reputation and fell into darkness, taking the hit for all of Harvey Dent's misconduct in order to protect Gotham City. This ending was essentially what emphasised the very fine line between good and evil, and how, in some circumstances, it is simply not distinguishable.

TDKR had a very good opportunity to expand on this idea. The extent to which it did so ultimately determined its success of failure. I think it did a pretty good job.

The acting was superb yet again. Christian Bale is the finest Batman to date, not to mention the numerous other well known actors who each carried their own respectively. The special effects are beyond magical. The script is solid. TDKR proved to be a very entertaining experience.

All of the Batman titles have been extraordinary, TDKR no doubt. Nevertheless, my personal preference is the original Batman Begins. The story-arc of Batman, good and evil, and morality is much more in depth. TDK would be second on my list merely because the Joker was my favourite villain. Even though TDKR comes third, it is, like I have said, a great addition to the rest of the Batman movies. It needs to be viewed."
"(SPOILER FREE)

Christopher Nolan has outdone himself with The Dark Knight Rises. The power behind both it's plot and the chilling visuals that Nolan brings to the screen will haunt you and scare you like no horror movie can. Not only is this a film about overcoming fear, like the first film, or learning about sacrifice like the 2nd film; The Dark Knight Rises is a film ironically contradicting the first film in that Batman needed to be fearful again in order to succeed. Rises also presented itself with a plot that embodies many of today's real world political arguments.

The Dark Knight was always called the Citizen Kane of our time, but comparing that film to TDKR is like comparing a slice of pizza to a whole pie. TDKR is the nutshell, and unlike the previous installment, is tied to Batman Begins a bit more. In a sense, it feels like the real ""Part 2"" of the trilogy, whereas TDK was the subplot, like the ones included at the end of a monthly DC comic to flesh out a story arc. This 3rd and final movie matches the emotions induced from the first film, and is the darkest and most terrifying one of them all. If you're expecting humor, or fun, or just want to be entertained. Forget it. This is not an entertaining film. It's dark, its serious, and more violent then the last 2 as well. As a viewer, I was thrown into the middle of a modern world on the cusp of apocalypse and anarchy. And Nolan presented such a rich atmosphere that a pang of panic shuddered through me for most of the experience.

Now, I'm a huge Batman fan, and wanted to bring up what I thought from a comic book geek's perspective. Yes, I was always a bit harsh on Nolan for not being nostalgic enough, and even Batman Begins felt a bit too realistic. TDKR does pay homage to the comics here and there, but very little.

However, I've come to grips with Nolan's vision, since he is just an absolute master director; although could use work on his writing. I loved the lines in this film, especially those spoken by Wayne, Alfred and Bane, but what Nolan needs to work on is plot holes. He is not a great writer by far, and neither is his brother because there are some few plot holes in this movie that could have been addressed. But he can sure pace a film. TDKR plays out like a novel, each scene slowly building tension, and at times, certain scenes break this tension, but not too much. Perhaps, there his huge budget led him to shoot and write too many scenes, and some could have been sacrificed to make room for necessary scenes. A minor gripe...and I would love to see a director's cut. All this is easily overlooked after witnessing such masterful film direction. Nolan used inspirations from everything from spaghetti western films, Kubrick's silent wide angle shots, movies like Metropolis and Spartacus come to mind at times, and it's safe to say that this film is more like a war movie instead of an urban crime drama. Nolan's own patented quick cuts are less frequent in this film, and even John Carpenter's famous apocalyptic urban opera, Escape from New York comes to mind when watching TDKR.

I won't get into the acting too much, Bale is the best Batman by far, and he is the best in this film. My favorite performance was from Gordon Levitt. A fine actor and I look forward to seeing him in more films; Nolan films preferred! And as for Bane not being menacing? well, I disagree. He was physically menacing, and if you were disappointed in the fight scenes in TDK like I was, then you will surely leave the theater satisfied this time out. The fist fights in this film are breathtaking to say the least, Nolan puts you right in the middle of them, no music, just the sound of fists hitting bone.

9/10 for incredible film directing, pacing, score, and top-notch acting by the entire cast. This is a hardcore, old school film with lots of extras, and minimal CGI. The chilling villains and the steps they take to carry out their ideals and goals are absolutely terrifying. I live in Gotham City myself, NYC to be exact, and seeing the city in absolute states of anarchy had haunted me for hours after leaving the theater. I would have given this a perfect 10 if not for the choppiness of the story. The end felt cut to death, as if Nolan took a 5 hour film and condensed it to two and half hours. This film needed more scenes...but instead, there were too many time jumps...and it really hurt the pacing of the film. It's a shame that there was never a directors cut... :("
"To start with just one word - Magnificent? Awesome? Epic? Flawless? Well in this case all of them! Nolan truly outdid himself this time, more than what he did with The Dark Knight in 2008.

After being fortunate to attend a special premier screening before the rest of the world, for the entire duration of the movie I was just glued to my seat without giving a dam what was happening anywhere else. Right from the opening credits till the end, the movie was just mind blowing.

They plot is simply awesome, one of the best stories ever told, and certainly for a comic book movie - a cool adaptation of the graphic novels of The Dark Knight Returns and No Man's Land and of course from the Knightfall story arc. Being a comic book fan I got blown away as the movie continued and each time the entire place went in an uproar. If you have read the comics one would love it even more, otherwise the plot is so well written with so much twists, humour at well unexpected places and great moments that anyone would be blown away.

Action - now this is the other major part. As having more than an hour of IMAX shooting, the movie truly lives up to its Action and War film genres. Despite sitting for ~3 hour it felt the movie got over very soon. Such is the intensity you can hope to be totally hooked into.

Acting was a class apart. Tom Hardy's Bane was indeed terrifying living up to his reputation; Gary Oldman's Gordon, Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Blake and Michael Cain's Alfred were very well made characters, emotional and core to the plot. Anne Hathaway made a really cool Catwoman, her screen time was full of awesome moments. And lets not forget the main Batman, Bale's BEST performance yet.

Hans Zimmer also really outdid himself like Nolan in terms of the music score.

So the conclusion is: 10/10

The most common and sort of obvious debate will be The Dark Knight vs. The Dark Knight Rises. Well I'd say I love both the movies, but saying one ""better"" than the other is not exactly right, rather I would say The Dark Knight Rises is bigger and more grand. Hope that helps. One of the best movies in decades literally. MUST watch."
"First things first. Refresh yourselves with Batman Begins as the plot contains key elements from the first movie of Nolan's Batman reboot. One more thing, do not dare compare it with The Dark Knight, because that might let you tiny bit down. Otherwise, the movie is a brilliantly crafted conclusion and leaves you with that feeling you get when you're leaving the theater after a great movie.

For a stretching 164 minutes, the pace never drops down even with the most emotional and monotonous scenes. Just when you thought, ""God, what is happening?"" the genius storyteller surprises you and all you can say is, ""Man, that was something!"" And in the end it's worth watching that long, arduous journey of a retired Batman. If anything, you feel why isn't there more of it.

Performance wise Bale has outdone himself. In previous movies, he transformed from an eccentric billionaire into a vigilante and then into a dark, silent and a watchful protector. Here he gives his everything to an aging Batman who is tested to his very core by a villain for whom he's no match. One of the scenes where he's attempting to get out of an under ground prison just gives you goosebumps.

Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman return to their respective roles with both Alfred and Lucius trying to convince Bruce Wayne into what they think is the best for him. The bond of Alfred and Bruce turns a bit emotional, in fact the movie is all about that human aspect of a superhero.

Hathaway's Selina Kyle brings that missing element to the table with a sparkling chemistry with Bale and some mysterious motives. Marion Cotillard is Miranda Tate, an investor who tries to persuade Bruce to make use of his wealth to better the world.

Hardy's Bane is an incredible presence, right from the beginning(though not as good as the joker). He's fierce with his hulking size, his mask which helps him manage his pain and an amplified Darth Vader like voice. He is the physical test which the Batman fails for the first time in the trilogy. He literally breaks the Batman, as all the comic lovers would have read(""Break you!!"").

Gordon-Levitt is another new entry into the franchise in the role of a pro Batman cop John Blake. He empathizes with Wayne as both of them are orphans and by the climax it seems he might even reprise the role in a spin-off.

Set on the backdrop of a french-revolution-cum-Charles-Dickens scenario, the city is on verge of an apocalypse. Every bridge to the outside world is blown off and the rich and the privileged are tried publicly with exile or death as their only options. A great Background score from Hans Zimmer means you'll be on your toes all the times. As if all this wasn't enough, the emotional climax will but sweep you off your feet. Nolan has mastered this art of leaving the audience with an awe and add to that some amazing cinematography, 72 minutes worth of IMAX shots and some swash-buckling actions sequences.

I say go for it, it's all you've been waiting for and more!"
"Superhero trilogies have a way of ending in a sour note. This is the first one to end on a high note.

Straight to it. The plot: Takes place 8 years after the events of The Dark Knight, Batman has disappeared, Gotham is enjoying peacetime, Comissioner Gordon is racked with guilt having to conceal Dent's murders,and Bruce Wayne is a recluse whose physical and mental condition has deteriorated. Bane emerges as a new villain who plans to destroy Gotham (which oddly enough looks exactly like New York City now, instead of Chicago like the last two films). Like Batman Begins the events leading up to the grand destruction are subtly put in place to show us the calm before the storm. And as you can tell from the trailer Bane severely injures Batman and drops him into this underground jail.

Unlike TDK, TDKR has a much more cohesive plot with much less plot holes even though they still exist its not as extensive as TDK (5 dead two of them cops, where?!). It also has a proper three act structure with a climax towards the end of the film and not the middle like TDK. I also felt that this film had much less cheesy dialogue than TDK.

The cast is again on point here. Christian Bale again does a pretty good job in showing a Bruce Wayne gone through hell, and this time he eased up a little on the Batman voice. Michael Caine as Alfred who is still the comic relief but unfortunately he's absent through most of this film (part of the plot). Gary Oldman as Comissioner Gordon, who's not so stressed out in this film like he was in the last oddly enough. Joseph Gordon Levitt plays John Blake an idealistic cop who actually is useful. Morgan Freeman, still love him. And Marion Cotillard plays a new board member Miranda.

Anne Hathaway as Catwoman was incredible. She was actually really hot, her costume looked dynamic like an actual high tech jewel thief and not some sort of weird S & M outfit (safe to say she doesn't have a whip), and she was portrayed as a femme fatale which was so much cooler. When initially learning that Tom Hardy was going to play Bane and not some taller guy, it was the same reaction as to when we learned Heath Ledger was playing the Joker, and yet again I was proved wrong. Tom Hardy was menacing as Bane. He looked physically imposing and his voice is much clearer but still a little muffled.

This has to be the best superhero trilogy ever made. Since DC Comics keep re-imagining their characters they are open to many artistic interpretations and Chris Nolan did it the best with Batman. He took this comic book character that for many years was placed in this very cartoonish universe and was put in a very realistic place making a very visceral piece of art. Each film had a very different look to it and thats what makes it a really good trilogy.

I have very little gripes with this film, actually just one but that pertains to the ending. But its just a minute detail.

On a side note I hope the state of Colorado can pick themselves up again after another tragedy. I hope the United States realizes how important regulating guns is and not chastising the media (this is just a friendly message from a Canadian friend don't take it the wrong way).

A very satisfying conclusion to an excellent trilogy."
"I can't praise Christopher Nolan enough. What he has done with his Dark Knight Trilogy is simply breathtaking. I don't know what I can say about this film that hasn't already been said, but I feel obligated to share my praises.

This film keeps you under it's spell from beginning to end. That is hard to find in a one and a half hour film these days. This film is almost 3 hours long. Batman's journey in this trilogy has been a tough, dark one. I have been a major Batman fan my whole life and was as giddy as a school girl with the many Batman universe references. The acting was superb from everyone involved. Michael Cane deserves an Oscar nom for his portrayal as Alfred. I could feel his emotion for Bruce with every scene he had. Tom Hardy as Bane was terrifying. A major departure from the last Bane we saw in a Batman film. Christian Bale will forever be my image of the Batman. I think it would be nearly impossible to top his version of the hero. Everyone else was great too but I must make known my feelings for Catwoman. Anne Hathaway definitely made the character her own. We can't compare her to Michelle Pfiffer. Pfiffer's Catwoman was a very different one than Anne's. I was concerned when I heard Anne was taking the role, but all my concerns flew out the window when she walked on screen (And they should have because Anne has proved herself many times). She gave Catwoman heart and you cared for her as the story progressed.

The only gripe that I have with the film is that a couple times, the editing seemed weird. You'd be watching a scene and then it would cut to another scene for someone to speak one line, then go back. I'm sure since the movie was pushing three hours they had a difficult time editing it. I guess I shouldn't even call that a gripe as it takes nothing away from this masterpiece of a film. I was very curious to see how Nolan would end this trilogy. I didn't think he'd let me down, and let me down he did not! It was perfect!

Wait, I do have a complaint... this trilogy is over. Sigh."
"I have to admit feeling a bit flat after watching this. I didn't have any expectations one way or the other when I went to see it. But it felt a bit slow and pedestrian at times. I've read where other people have said it's 'phenomenal' but I'm sorry, I just don't see it that way. I didn't find Bane as a particularly well thought out character and even his speech didn't quite seem to suit the part. In other areas of the film, it just wasn't convincing. I really think the last two Batman films had a lot more flare than this. I wasn't looking at my watch during the show (like I kept doing during the last 40 minutes of Lord of the Rings III) but I wasn't far off. Don't get me wrong, it's a good film but it certainly doesn't feel like a great film. I won't be rushing out to grab the DVD when it comes out to watch it again. And fair warning, it's a long film too."
"On a rainy July day in 2005, at the age of 12 my father and I decided to take a matinée trip to the movies. We were prepared to see the highly anticipated Batman Begins and by the end were convinced that director Christopher Nolan had put together something special when that joker card was flipped at the ending by Gary Oldman. Nolan had directed the best Batman film up to date and even more fireworks were on the horizon.

In 2008, I was a little older and was anxious to see what was in store for the second batman movie. I didn't leave the theater disappointed as I watched Heath Ledger deliver one of the most powerful performances of all time in his joker role. The only thought that raced through my mind after seeing the Dark Knight was, how could this movie be topped without Heath Ledger?

Going into the movie Friday morning I believed that I would be walking out happy but I walked in with the thought that the Dark Knight was untouchable. Boy was I wrong! The Dark Knight Rises absolutely had it all. Action, suspense, emotion, you name it. There was never a dull moment in this film. I was never once thinking to myself, man! is this thing ever going to end? Christian Bale, in my opinion delivers his best acting performance of his triumphant career as the Bruce Wayne character is in a dark painful stage of emotion until Gotham needs him to be the Batman again. The female roles of Selina Kyle and Miranda Tate portrayed by Anne Hathaway and Marion Cotillard are by far the best female performances of the trilogy as they bring suspense, sexiness, and wit to the film. The rest of the original cast is also absolutely phenomenal as you get to see a lot more of Afred, Luscious Fox, and Commissioner Gordon who are played respectively by Caine, Freeman, and Oldman. Joseph Gordon-Levitt brings a strong best supporting actor worthy performance with his belief in the Batman and could be compared to Aaron Eckharts Harvey Dent character. Finally, although Mr. Ledgers portrayal of the Joker in the Dark Knight is nearly flawless and tough to top, Tom Hardy brings physical and mental toughness to the film which keeps the Batman on the balls of his feet the whole entire movie. You are left with an unbelievable ending and depending on your love for these films, may be shaking by movies end. You won't want to leave your seat and it is worth every bit of your top earned dollar. I was never bored during this film as it executes as great of dialogue and plot structure that you can see in a movie. All praises to the Dark Knight, but this lead up topped the unbeatable in this situation. One of the greatest movies I've ever seen. Instant classic in all forms of the imagination."
"Going into it I was not sure what this film would do to match the last installment. I had my concerns and while I thought that the movie was a very solid film, I walked away confused. On one hand I thought that the movie was very well constructed and and visually very pleasing. But I cannot say that I ""enjoyed"" it. It was just too dark and depressing and devoid of any form of joy. That said I am glad I saw it but due to it's length and extremely brooding nature, I will not see it again in the theater. I know that the fanboys will disagree, but I can only say what I have experienced...after walking out of the theater, myself and my group of buds were all silent. nobody wanted to discuss the film, rather we all agreed that it was good but it left us all feeling a little down.

Would I recommend this movie? If you are a fan of the first 2...then yes. But I would be remiss if I did not warn about the excessive darkness of this movie."
"I felt compelled to submit my first IMDb review after seeing the film today and looking at the IMDb rating and some of the reviews which have been posted.

Nolan has been praised for his gritty realistic portrayal of batman, yet chooses to focus this last film on a giant cartoon bomb with huge digits counting down to destruction.

WOW...

Social, moral and political issues are hinted at but never truly addressed, instead mind-numbing punch-ups and chases play out with inevitable conclusions."
"Director Christopher Nolan's epic ""The Dark Knight Rises"" opens with a breathtaking aerial display as skydivers propel into the vertical aircraft fuselage. No CGI here. You can also feel the impact as Christian Bale's Batman trades vicious martial arts blows with the muscled monstrosity Bane, terrifying muzzled Tom Hardy. However, the Dark Knight truly rises in the quiet humanity of the authentic relationship of Bruce Wayne (Bale) and his guardian Alfred, played by Michael Caine. Intentionally becoming the reclusive martyr for the good of Gotham City, lonely broken Bruce confesses to Alfred, ""There is nothing for me out there."" Caine is mesmerizing as he tells the story of when Bruce was missing for 7 years that he would travel to Florence every year hoping to glimpse Bruce at peace in his life. Everyone deserves to find that modicum of peace in life, including the hero. What is the karma of the hero? This pursuit resonates in Christopher Nolan's cinematic parable.

""The Dark Knight Rises"" completes this amazing trilogy, and is the distinct end of the hero's journey for Bruce Wayne. Nolan said, ""Every great story deserves a great ending."" Chris Nolan has done so on a massive scale, that is so eloquent and personal in catharsis. He leverages the classics quoting Dickens, ""It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better resting place that I go to, than I have ever known."" Nolan brilliantly comes full circle in the hero mythology. I have read several critic reviews praising ""The Dark Knight Rises"" that understates Christian Bale. To be clear: Christian Bale is powerful. The amazing actor makes ""The Dark Knight Rises"" satisfying and complete.

In the story by Nolan, Jonathan Nolan, and David S. Goyer, 8 years has passed since ""The Dark Knight"". Batman framed himself for District Attorney Dent's murder, making himself a vigilante fugitive. Commissioner Gordon, played with tortured gravitas by Gary Oldman, reluctantly furthers the conspiracy for the greater good. Bale's Bruce is a hollowed man, nearly crippled from his injuries and suffering a broken heart—the love of his life murdered. In the Batman mythology, Bruce created Batman as a symbol to inspire others, to be incorruptible and immortal. The paradox was that Batman also was born out of Bruce's story of his powerlessness as a child to prevent his parents' brutal murder.

Bale captures Bruce's anger and emptiness beneath the charming visage. Here Nolan creates Bruce's younger reflection in charismatic and intense Joseph Gordon-Levitt as police officer John Blake. This is the unfamiliar Bruce Wayne, whose soul seems more ravaged than his body. Blake believes in heroes; he believes in Batman. Bale brilliantly hints at the fire within Bruce, waiting for a cause. He tragically inhabits a man who fears life, more than death. Strong and compassionate Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle pleads with Batman, ""You've given them everything!"" Bruce says, ""Not everything. Not yet...""

Every great hero story is defined by a great villain. That is Bane. Tom Hardy is awesome as the nearly indestructible Bane. Hardy put on 30 pounds of muscle to play the ferocious Bane. He is sheer force. Bane is the enigmatic bald hulk with a mask that treats the unbearable pain of an unspeakable injury. The mask distorts his voice, sounding like Darth Vader. At times it is incoherent; however Hardy's commanding intentions are distinct. Bane is the paid terrorist, who was excommunicated from the League of Shadows, the Ninja Clan that also trained Bruce. Their mentor was Ra's Al Ghul (charismatic Liam Neeson). Nolan strokes Bane as more anarchist than mercenary. The merciless Bane is strangely noble. Perhaps, the difference between the hero and the villain lies in the choices he made?

Nolan's exposition is as ambitious as the action and visuals. He viscerally paints the post 911 world on the tipping point of economic collapse, fear, and class warfare. He also incorporates storyline with Wayne Industries' shelved fusion project for clean sustainable energy source that gets turned sideways. Enter Miranda Tate (beautiful and mysterious Marion Cotillard), Wayne Board member, who has a strong attraction for the reclusive Wayne.

Anne Hathaway as sleek cat burglar Selina Kyle steals Bruce's valued keepsake and something invaluable tied to the shadowy conspiracy that ultimately leads to Bane. Intrigued Bruce enrolls CEO Lucius Fox (solid Morgan Freeman) to get him back into the game. Their bond has morphed into an unspoken caring. Hathaway is stunning. Though she is never called Cat Woman in the movie, she looks amazing in the skin tight leather, and kicks martial arts butt. The weird part, her mastery in kickboxing and Aikido is never explained. Beneath the bravado, Hathaway displays a tender soul. The hero always sees and believes the best in people. Bale and Hathaway have that quality, and that belies Nolan's poignant theme of redemption.

""The Dark Knight Rises"" is the best movie of the year. Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale are awesome. The epic journey of the hero comes to an end, and we are inspired. All is complete."
"If you have been following The Dark Knight trilogy i can guarantee that you will love this movie. This is a very satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. It hits all the right notes and has very emotionally driven scenes.

*The acting is superb; every actor shines, especially Christian Bale and Michael Caine. Tom Hardy is fantastic and for those of you worried about having trouble with Bane's voice, the issue is NEARLY non existent. That being said there are a few lines that may prove to be inaudible. I also believe that Anne Hathaway was phenomenal as Catwoman. Her presence is felt whenever she appears on screen and demands your absolute attention. Same goes for Bane as his voice is by for the most powerful on screen.

* As a side note for those devoted batman fans, this is definitely Nolan's answer. The movie felt like a graphic novel with a handful of supporting characters, and YES Batman does finally make use of batarangs! And several comic book references and one that takes the cake! but i will not spoil it.

*The only gripe I had with the movie was the pacing near the end of the film near its climax, some scenes have a difficult timeline to grasp as a day or a few hours can pass without a proper explanation of how certain things can be possible. But I assure you this is a very minor, and doesn't not warrant one to not see this movie.

Do yourself a favor and see this movie!"
"We need you too, Bruce. After four years of waiting finally a third sequel, the conclusion to one of the best film trilogies in history arrives in cinemas. The question which comes to everyone's mind is: Is it a worthy conclusion? Of course it is. Did you expect a different answer?

I noticed that people nowadays can't just simply enjoy a film. They look for mistakes, nitpick plot holes, details, clichés and complain about twists and turns in the story. They should be grateful for any twists and turns in the story when some movies completely miss a plot whatsoever. When I was coming out of the cinema I heard all these people and my friends too complaining about Bane or the ending. I was the only one who stated that I enjoyed the film. I mean isn't that what's important? Whether you enjoyed the film overall or not.

The ensemble of actors in this film is truly magnificent. All of them give a tremendous performance. Bane is not such a fun and charismatic villain as the Joker but Tom Hardy makes the character fun to watch in its own way. You have to admire his brutality and fight skills which really let shine in the first and best hand-to-hand fight scene with Batman. It really seems that he is undefeatable. I also enjoyed how he questions loyalty but he doesn't give a damn about the lives of his henchmen thus being a hard boss to be loyal to. First I didn't like that muzzle he has over his face but in the film it just merges with the character and you don't notice it at all. I found nothing wrong with his voice. Yes, maybe it is a little bit muffled but I found it quite fun and engaging into the film when you don't understand everything a character says. I believe that it is no surprise that Joseph Gordon Levitt is amazing once again.

While being extremely gorgeous Anne Hathaway gives one of her best performances in her career. She funny, witty and sexy, amazing at kicking asses. Everything Catwoman should be but she is never referred as Catwoman in the film only as Selina Kyle but trust me it all has a very good explanation. And of course Christian Bale gives tremendous performance as Bruce Wayne/Batman. Now that the film is once again focused on Bruce Wayne Bale has change to show off his acting skills. That was what was bothering me with The Dark Knight, it wasn't about Batman.

Hans Zimmer this time not working with James Newton Howard doesn't bring many new tunes to the film. Still the few of new themes as Bane's or Selina Kyle's are magnificent.

Cinematography in this film is absolutely amazing. What is being done with the camera in some of the chase scenes or the opening scene which will leave you breathless is just Wow! Wally Pfister deserves an Oscar for every film he worked on and this time he truly deserves it so I hope he will win this time.

In the end I want to congratulate to the genius of Christopher Nolan for making this amazing trilogy, for giving us such amazing experiences with each film and for presenting us with this wonderful take on Batman which we will never see transformed on screen as breathtaking as from Christopher Nolan"
"Just watched the movie have two word 'Spectacular' and 'Hugely satisfying'.

If movie making is form of art then Chris Nolan and his brother has to greatest artistic of our generation.

If mankind has to select 5 people who would be live forever.

Chris Nolan has to one of them if he keeps making movies like this.

Hans Zimmer has delivered his best.

There are several hair raising sequences .

the movie is dark, very realistic and legendary

That leave one and and all asking for More and more!!!

Locals ...take control of Yours theater's ...hahahehhehehee"
"Just wanted to say that there are movies & then there is THE DARK KNIGHT RISES. I do not have words to describe the amazing feeling that i have had right from the start of this movie.....sorry not movie but an epic.....Mr. Nolan..........HATS OF TO YOU.

And yes i do agree....i do not see a 4th part to this series...but if there should one come.....its going to be real interesting & totally unexpected.

OH AND YES GREAT WORK BY ONE AND ALL FROM THE CAST....SIR Christian BALE.....!!!!!!!WOW!!!!!!!!

LAST WORD FOR NOLAN AGAIN.....U HAVE MADE BATMAN IMMORTAL, A MORE REAL & ACCEPTABLE HERO...AND I TRULY BELIEVE THE WORDS "" ANYONE CAN BE BATMAN"""
"This year has been kind to comic book lovers, with blockbuster hits such as The Avengers, The Amazing Spiderman the not-so well received Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance and now The Dark Knight Rises. Nolan's resurrection of Batman garnered huge success both commercially and critically, and the conclusion of the trilogy seems no different: although it is behind the previous installment, The Dark Knight, in terms of opening, but passed the $300 million at domestic box office in just twelve day, making it one of the fastest grossing movie of 2012.

Eight years passed since the night Batman has disappeared, when he assumed all the guilts and crimes of Harvey Dent. Since then Gotham City is in a state of peace and thanks to the Dent Act, the Gotham City Police Department has eradicated the majority of organized crime. But a thief wearing cat dress appears in the city, along with a notorious terrorist, Bane, who is determined to destroy Gotham City, as being a member of the League of Shadows. Bruce Wayne realizes the city once again needs The Dark Knight to fight the menace, but quickly learns that he found one of his deadliest enemy...

The film features an impressive cast, with excellent actors. Christian Bale is great as Batman, but as the story unfolds, you almost want Bane to succeed in his quest, just because the excellent portrayal by Tom Hardy. The sheer terror and the menace he causes making him the best villain in the trilogy. The film introduces two new sidekicks: the Catwoman, portrayed by Anne Hathaway, and Blake, the police officer, portrayed by Joseph-Gordon Lewitt (known for Inception) both giving solid performances in their respective roles. The older triumvirate including Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, and Morgan Freeman were just icing on the cake, each actor delivering superb performance.

The cinematography simply exceeded my expectations on every possible level. Fantastic costumes and crisp looking special effects, excellent pacing, and well-choreographed action scenes to sum it up. Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard also did a terrific job creating the score, delivering a dynamically flowing and expanding music thorough the movie. The Dark Knight Rises surpassed all of my expectations, and set a new bar of standards for me. It isn't perfect movie, but definitely a damn close being one. To nitpick: Bane's character differs from the comic book ones, and I found Talia's role in the movie to be completely redundant. Gotham City also resembles too much to New York City. I also expected a bit better ending for Bane, but I can't really complain, I guess.

This full-fledged and mature Batman is a must-see for comic book readers and fans. Batman's fantastic and climaxing ending, classy and memorable acting, huge production value, and amazing cinematography all packed in a $5 ticket. Good luck.

"I have to say I am very pleased with The Dark Knight Rises. Christopher Nolan really pulled off another great film. The plot is brilliant, the cast of actors are very talented and convincing.

The plot takes place eight years after the previous film, where the citizens of Gotham consider Batman the enemy. But when a new ruthless villain by the name of Bane terrorizes the city and Batman is forced to rise again, and Batman really meets his match in this film because Bane is an absolute monster with lightening fast speed and power. The plot is also packed with action and mind-blowing special effects that will leave you with a smile on your face.

The actors are also mind-blowing. Tom Hardy did a fantastic job at playing Bane. His character is very ominous and even scary at times. Without a doubt Bane has to be my favourite villain yet because Christopher Nolan really made him realistic, it actually felt like Bane just could be a modern day terrorist. Another actor that did a phenomenal job is Michael Cain. I always love watching that guy act, he has so much talent and there is always something soothing about him when I see him act, he always puts on a fantastic performance. And Anne Hathaway who plays Selena Kyle and Catwoman really pulled off a great Catwoman, her character was very entertaining to watch. And Christian Bale once again does not disappoint with his portrayal of Batman and Bruce Wayne.

The only reason why I didn't give this film the full 10 stars is because Batman didn't have as much screen time as he should have, there is like a big 45 minute gap where Batman is not in it. The film is brilliant don't get me wrong, but there was a few times during the movie where it didn't feel like a Batman movie. But don't worry it makes up for it in the climax. But still Batman should have had more screen time.

This film is an absolute must-see. It has stunning, mind-blowing action with great actors and a phenomenal plot. And yes the movie is almost 3 hours but you really don't even notice because the plot and the action just sucks you in. Don't miss out on this movie, it is absolutely phenomenal"
"Ever since 'The Dark Knight' was released I was so curious to see how this all going to end for Bruce Wayne more than the Batman (you cannot end Batman).

The plot still connects to the first and second instalment. That shows the brilliance of the script writers. Bane as a villain, was a good performance by Tom Hardy and menacing. After Joker, you cannot better, at least you have good enough. All the other supporting cast did their job really well. Christian Bale once again showed what a fantastic actor he is.

Technically the film is brilliant. The vision is really big and wide from the director and the cinematographer. They came up with some fantastic mind blowing action sequences. You don't have Batman appearance often, but when ever he enters I got goose bumps. Music is fantastic as usual and very appropriate.

All the credit should go to Nolan for creating a master piece trilogy in this genre. He continues he reputation of making film with thrill and emotion. After Dark Knight, when you know you cannot create a batter film than that, he was still managed to come up with a film like this.

Overall, Brilliant and very satisfying Finale to Bruce Wayne and the Batman."
"Firstly, i think its fair to say you can't really compare this to TDK. TDKR is a very different movie in the sense it just beautifully brings everything full circle and is an action-packed and emotional ending. The whole cast do a fantastic job and there are some really beautiful and very emotional scenes between Bale and Caine, and Nolan does a great job of letting each character shine.

Alongside the tender moments are some great action scenes, and the final climatic showdown is especially a spectacular sight. The fight scenes however aren't as mind-blowing and adrenaline-fuelled as the previous films but are still enjoyable.

Bane is a great villain and poses a huge physical and mental threat to Batman. Bane is obviously not as great and memorable character as The Joker, but as i said before, they are different characters with different uses. Joker was there to create chaos. Bane is here to physically and mentally push Batman.

The cinematography was beautiful and the Zimmer's score creates such an atmospheric mood. TDKR is actually such an ambitious film, tackling many large and complicated themes while creating tense, emotionally charged but action-packed scenes. Nolan really does an excellent job here.

TDKR builds and builds to a very tense but fantastic ending. There are even a few plot twists thrown in there but thankfully everything is tied up neatly; no loose ends. We get a definite conclusion to a fantastic trilogy."
"The Most Amazing movie in History! It gives you that feeling of want to see it again and again and again. Really good story, amazing performances, a stupendous soundtrack and a sensational directing brings us the best movie of the trilogy (in my opinion). About Bane's voice, I don't see any problem I understand everything that he says and it is a amazing voice that i can't forget. Everyone on the cast performed very well, and the new entrances such like Marion Cotillard, Tom Hardy, Anne Hathaway and Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a amazing job bringing this new characters to this last film of Batman. It is not much to say because it is simply a exuberant film. I know that they will probably reboot Batman and if they will, all I can say is good luck to beat this trilogy."
"The Dark Knight Rises is the 3rd and final installment in Nolan's Batman film trilogy. Coming to the film, 3 words to describe it: IT WAS AWESOME. I have never seen such an amazing superhero film. The ending is perfect. Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and Cillian Murphy reprise their roles as Bruce/Batman, Alfred, James Gordon, Lucius Fox, Dr. Jonathan Crane and they did an amazing job in the film. The film introduces two main characters to Nolan's series: Selina Kyle/Catwoman (played by Anne Hathaway), a cat burglar; and Bane (played by Tom Hardy), a masked-man mercenary. Selina Kyle/Catwoman was just amazing. She acted very well. Her moves were awesome. Bane was a good villain, but, he wasn't as awesome as The Joker. Everything from the visual effects to the sound effects, the cast and crew, the screenplay were perfect. There were some twists in the film which made the film more better and a little bit mysterious... at the beginning of the film you can't plan or know what is gonna happen because some twists will completely surprise you! Hats-off to Christopher Nolan and his decision about TDKR being the last film in the trilogy is completely right. The last part completes the trilogy and there is no need of more parts to complicate it. It is the second best superhero film I have seen till now after The Avengers. TDKR is a must-watch. It is worth to watch it in the cinema. You won't enjoy it if you download it as much as you will in the cinema.

Good bye Bruce/Batman, Selina/Catwoman, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, The Joker, Bane, John Blake, and last but not the least, Alfred. I WILL REALLY MISS YOU GUYS. Once again, HATS-OFF TO NOLAN! :D"
"When I walked in to the theater for the pre-screening of The Dark Knight rises, I expected to find another Christopher Nolan thriller, with some respectful accents, thanks to Hans Zimmer. What I found? Over the edge entertainment. I got lost in this movie. Being a filmmaker myself I deemed it more than I can probably ever accomplish. It was more worthy than my respect. It was way more than I could expect. An incredible fountain of thought that did a great job ""Closing the book"" if you will, on Christopher Nolan's long, hard work. This movie is a MUST see. Tom Hardy's portrayal of Bane is really, quite honestly the perfect villain. (He's even quite competitive with the joker in my opinion.) Anne Hathaway is superb. Christian Bale is an incredible ""Dark Hero"" as always. Gotham is more than worthy of Gary Oldman's loyalty. And Liam Neeson? Well.. He's just Liam Neeson. All of the acting is out of this world. The scripting. The sound effects. The cinematography. The ending..... :). All cast and crew deserve at least the respect of American movie go-ers, for the creation of this true masterpiece. Well done... Truly, well done."
"I have to say that Nolan have succeeded in creating the ""Epic conclusion to the Dark Knight series"" but still, for a movie with so much hype and expectations and as a great fan of Chris Nolan's Batman, I have to say that I am disappointed in a few aspects, and it made me leaving the cinema frowning (I'm not saying that the movie is bad, it has its moment of epicness, but still...there's something missing here and there)

When I first watch the trailer, listened to the Bane's voice, and looking up a lot about Bane's origin, my expectations of this movie rocketed. Added by the fact that Nolan cast Tom Hardy (which I am a great fan of him, and his superb performance in the movie ""Warrior"" made me believe that he would be the best choice in performing as Bane), I expected to the see the same rage, anger and destructive fighting-style as the one Tom hardy showed in the film ""Warrior"". I couldn't wait to see Bane's monstrous fighting. I had also expected Nolan to give plots and scenes that can match the previous movie. But, unfortunately TDKR did not manage to give me what I had hoped for.

First of all, casting Tom Hardy as the destructive Bane was a perfect decision, but Nolan had failed to utilize Tom's potential and failed big time in the fight choreography. In the scene where Bane ""breaks the bat"", it looked to me like Batman was losing on purpose rather than overwhelmed by Bane's superior fighting skills. The camera was also very disappointing because I could not see the fighting clearly and most of the time the camera shoots either too close covering only one of the character or shooting only the back of either Bane or Batman so I couldn't see what was going on. In both fighting scene, it lacks passion and it looked like it was faked. To add that disappointment is how quick and easy Batman to defeat Bane in the second battle. It really changed the image of the undefeated Bane into just another strong henchmen. It made me a really angry because i was like ""dude, i wanna see a real fight!!""

Secondly, overall plot of the movie was as amazing as I had hoped for, but it was executed poorly. It made me think that Nolan was fitting too many important scenes causing a lot of the trivial scenes to just jump from one another. It was too quick. Its as if Nolan was pressed by the time limit then tried to jam all the scenes. The plot was amazing, but it just didn't exceed the Joker's scheme of mayhem. And when Talia al Ghul makes her appearance later in the movie, Nolan suddenly throws away all the importance of Bane, reducing him from a powerful evil mastermind into Talia's underdog. So not cool.

Anne Hatheway's performance was incredible, two thumbs up for her. Personally I prefer Hatheway's catwoman than Michelle Pfeiffer's. But her role and connection with Batman should be more emphasized. Christian Bale failed to perform the old and weakened Batman, rather to show that Bruce Wayne is now just tired and lazy to walk around without a stick. Michael Caine did a perfect job as the worried alfred, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt caught my attention with his energetic spirit.

To summarize, the movie was great but it needs a better plot and motives for the villain. Unlike the Joker's taste for chaos, Bane's motive is a lot like just another terrorist movie. Tom Hardy as an actor was excellent but Bane's role as ""Gotham's reckoning"" is disappointing. Some of the action scene was boring to me, and somehow in the last moment of Batman's attempt to thwart Gotham's destruction looks an awful lot like ""The Avengers"". It was so damn cheesy, what the hell is wrong with you Nolan? Ran out of idea? But still, the last 10 minutes of the movie was a great success, it made me forgot about the whole wreckage of the movie, delivering the Epic Conclusion.

This is my first review, I'm sorry if some of you don't agree with me, this is only my personal opinion and I hope it helps."
"Rarely has there been a movie which has had such a huge amount of hype and expectations burdened on its back.These high expectations generally weighs a movie down.Fortunatly The Dark Knight Rises Actually rise above the expectations and delivers what is the most fitting conclusion to the dark knight legend.

Plot-Eight years after the events of The Dark Knight, Gotham City is in a state of peace.Inevitabley this state of peace is only short lived as Bane invades Gotham and turns everything into chaos as batman tries to fight and his own demons,the city of Gotham awaits its fate. The hugely talented cast gives a stellar performance.I believed that Christian Bale was overshadowed by Heath ledger in his legendary portrayal of joker.Not in this one.He portrayed a vulnerable yet defiant batman,giving full justice to the title,tom hardy as bane is menacing and a physical specimen,posing a real threat to the batman in strength department.people need to stop comparing him to the joker,they are to entirely different characters Anna Hathaway as Selina Kyle is really intriguing,her anti hero like characters bring some humour to this dark tale,the rest of the cast Morgan Freeman(Lucius fox),Gary Oldman(Commissioner Gordon),Joseph Gordon-Levitt(Jhon Blake) all deliver great performances.Micheal Caine as Alfred really had screen time to shine and his performance brought a lump in the throat of many. The action sequences of this movie are an edge of the seat experience,they are well choreographed,Intense,In my opinion they are the best of the trilogy Chrisotpher Nolan is a real master of story telling,the depth of his movies,his characters are really admirable.And his ability to churn out great films after great films is nothing short of incredible. The score by Hans Zimmer was good,the editing,cinematography was top notch,Gotham never looked more hauntingly beautiful ever. Finally many of us have been asking if it is as good as the The dark knight,in my opinion this whole trilogy has had three excellent films which are connected to each other in more than one way,still they are vastly different form each other,So rather than asking that is it better than the dark knight we should ask if it brings the trilogy to a satisfying end,to which my answer is a huge YES. It is a perfect movie to end the best superhero trilogy ever.EPIC,AMAZING,EMOTIONAL AND SATISFYING.A MUST WATCH"
"I understand that it is very hard to follow something like The Dark Knight, not only because of how good that movie was but because of what happened to Heath Ledger. Knowing that this was his last Batman movie, I believe Christopher Nolan was trying a bit too hard at times with this one. I felt overwhelmed at times by all the story lines taking place at once. The Dark Knight had one main storyline revolving around The Joker. This movie had many different characters and story lines, from Batman to Catwoman to Bane and even Alfred. The ending to this movie and in turn Nolan's trilogy though was one of the best endings I've ever seen. It was a very fitting end and made myself and everyone in the theater discuss it while walking out of the theater, which is what every director wants. Overall, I thought it was a fitting end to a wonderful series."
"What a mess. This is one of Nolan's weakest movies and definitely the worst in the Batman trilogy.

I didn't expect much from the trailer, but it was even worse than I thought. It's not terrible, but it's not a good film either.

The characters were uninteresting, plot was a mess, lots of useless fighting scenes. Tom Hardy's talent was wasted and Bane character isn't even 1% as strong or as interesting as the Joker. Most of all I liked Michael Caine's performance, but that was brief and the editor rushed his few scenes too.

Oh, and the movie is waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too long. Did they really need 3 hours to tell this mess???"
"Christopher Nolan's version of the Batman universe is truly one of the most realistic and immersive versions I have seen. Whilst I'm not a major Batman fan, Nolan's trilogy had me hooked from the beginning. The films are mature and well-made, the characters are relatable and believable, the villains can be genuinely terrifying and the plot flows beautifully, never giving room for dull moments.

'The Dark Knigh Rises' is, in particular, the best of the trilogy and rightfully so, being the conclusion it certainly deserves to be called a grand finale. The cast, as usual, were perfect for their roles, new introductions such as Tom Hardy giving top performances and those from previous films, such as Christian Bale obviously, kept the standards high, if not raised them.

The movie definitely has the greatest scale to it, the shear size of the cast on screen at certain times shows how much effort and manpower has gone into making the film the stunning experience that it is. The movie takes elements from the previous films and combines them, raising the stakes in every way it can. The plot itself is even more gripping, the action more intense. For those that have seen the entire trilogy, you are made to feel this world that Nolan successfully draws us into over the course of the three films is in peril and you, as the viewer, begin to feel for it as much as those in the movie itself.

Once again, the plot is not as predictable as you might think, containing plenty of twists. It isn't always simply spoon-fed to you as with many hero-based films. I recommend watching the previous two films before this to truly appreciate this epic conclusion, however, even if you don't, the action-packed journey the movie takes you on should still have you greatly satisfied by the end.

This series stands out to me, from many other hero films, due to its maturity, its scale and the effort put in that can clearly be seen in all aspects, including the performances from the actors themselves. As a movie, it delivers everything you could expect and more, so even if you aren't a Batman fan, this film should appeal to you, providing you can appreciate a well-made film when you see one."
"Christopher Nolan's ""Batman"" trilogy that started with ""Batman Begins"" back in 2005, continued with 2008's ""The Dark Knight"", finally concludes with the arrival of ""The Dark Knight Rises"". And this conclusion is a very ambitious, thrilling, exciting, and epic ending to one of the greatest trilogies of all time. Nolan has transformed the meaning of superhero films. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is no longer a normal superhero film, it's something beyond that.

Not many movie sequels are able to match its predecessors' quality especially when the bar is so high. When the first entry is excellent, many sequels fail to match their predecessors' quality. But ""The Dark Knight"" on the other hand improved on the already amazing ""Batman Begins"". The third entry is even harder. An example is the Godfather trilogy which faltered with its third installment. But ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is different, it manages to meet the high standard set by its nearly-perfect predecessor.

Four years have since the release of ""The Dark Knight"". But the gap in the story is double that. Batman has taken the blame for Harvey Dent's crimes and he has disappeared for eight years since his encounter with Two-Face. In the process, Gotham is experiencing peace time while Bruce Wayne has grown during his hiding in Wayne Manor. He's even grown facial hair and uses a walking stick. Meanwhile, Wayne Enterprises is falling apart and is on the verge of bankruptcy.

However, Gotham faces a new threat, someone who is powerful both physically and mentally. He is no other than Bane. Equipped with a mask that supplies him a specific gas to help alleviate the excruciating pain he sustained years ago, he is one of Batman's most terrifying adversaries. What helps him become an even more dangerous villain is the brilliant performance by Tom Hardy. While his performance is no match for the brilliant performance of the late Heath Ledger, Hardy's is pleasing in its own right. His menacing voice adds a layer of tension to whenever he makes an appearance and his body-language performance is just outstanding. And of course, this Bane is much more menacing than the Bane we witnessed years ago in ""Batman & Robin"".

""The Dark Knight Rises"" starts off slow and the first hour of the film focuses on Bruce's eventual return as the Dark Knight. The tension eventually builds up into one of the best climax scenes Hollywood has ever created. Early on, minor characters get more screen time than they did before and this includes Alfred, Bruce's loyal butler, and Lucius Fox, the man behind all of Bruce's devices. We also meet some new characters, and those include two mysterious but important women whom we will meet throughout the film.

The two women are Selina Kyle and Miranda Tate. Selina Kyle is a professional cat burglar who is able to steal almost anything. She's also able to obtain Bruce Wayne's thumb prints. She's also known by her more famous alias, Catwoman. Her presence in the film ups the tension and excitement. Anne Hathaway's performance is also amazing as Catwoman. I didn't think she had what it takes but her performance here proved me wrong. She was able to portray someone who was charming, sly, and bad-ass. As for Miranda Tate, she is more than just Bruce's love interest and Marion Cotillard's performance successfully hides that.

""The Dark Knight Rises"" proves to be the biggest, darkest, and most epic ""Batman"" film yet. This is the first time we get to see Gotham in total chaos. Literally total chaos. Bane unleashes all the criminals Harvey Dent imprisoned during his time as DA and as a result, tremendous chaos ensues on the streets. The government is dead, the rich are robbed of their wealth, Gotham is in anarchy, everyone's life is at stake, and Gotham is on the verge of destruction while Batman is preparing to rise for one last stand against Bane. It's also the most emotional installment of the trilogy as the relationship between Bruce and Alfred is more damaged than ever.

Batman doesn't make many appearances here as he is struggling to rise but every time he makes an appearance, he does it in spectacular fashion. His presence on the screen always makes the audiences engaged. This can be attributed to Christian Bale's outstanding performance as the Caped Crusader. His 'Bat' voice is more menacing than ever and he mixes a perfect balance of emotions.

The other minor characters were also driven by amazing performances. Gary Oldman gave his best to portray Commissioner James Gordon. James Gordon-Levitt also gave a great performance for young cop John Blake. Michael Caine gave Alfred heart as his relationship with Bruce deteriorates. Morgan Freeman was stunning as he gave out some laughs as Lucius Fox. The cast's performances were all very excellent and they deserve the Oscars.

""The Dark Knight Rises"" is also the most action-packed movie of the trilogy. It may be slow at first but it switches to full gear in one of the most sensational climaxes ever. We get to see Batman fighting in the daylight. We also see Batman fight to his fullest against Bane as well as saving Gotham from total annihilation. It's lengthy, it's full of explosions, casualties, unsuspected revelations, and accompanied with flawless yet heart-pounding music.

All in all, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a beautiful piece of art. It changes the way people think about superhero films. It changes its meaning. It's beyond a normal superhero film. The villain is satisfying, the film is emotional and filled with heart, the performances are outstanding, and the climax is just brilliant. The ending of the film does not disappoint either. Christopher Nolan is now legend and ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is his magnum opus.

Rating: 10/10

Final Verdict: ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a stunning finale to Nolan's brilliant ""Batman"" trilogy and is truly legend."
"I was expecting this movie to be better, than Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. After watching it today, I can say, it exceeded all my expectations, I was not disappointed at all, I was more like an excited little kid, who could watch it over and over again.

I just realized, I'm not good at writing critics or reviews but there are a few misleading posts I would like to clarify.

""This isn't a Batman movie, more like a Bruce Wayne movie..."" there is no Batman without Bruce Wayne, but Christian Bale did a terrific job on portraying Batman even without a mask. You'll realize during the movie, almost every ally or protagonist of Batman will know who the Batman really is. I'm sure Nolan did this on purpose, and I believe most of you will agree.

I would like to point out two very outstanding actors as well: Michael Caine and Tom Hardy will leave you memories about their portrayal as Alfred and Bane, you won't forget for awhile. I feel the rest of the characters added a lot to the depth of the movie, too, but nowhere as deep as Alfred and Bane.

I don't want to spoil anything, but please make sure you go to the cinema and you take your friends with you, because this movie is worth every cent. I'm quite sure this is the best blockbuster of 2012 (if not that of all time) and you won't regret watching it!"
"The Dark knight Rises is not the Dark Knight, but it isn't trying to. Nolan takes a different route then his previous films. Instead of being a crime thriller like the dark knight, Rises is a war film. This is one of the most ambitious blockbuster ever made, it's the biggest Nolan film in scope, action and the sheer amount of things that are going on, but it's also the most intimate and emotional bat film. Bane is an incredible villain. as one of the most ridiculous villeins in the bat universe, i thought he would disappoint or be just a dumb sack of muscles. Nolan recreates Bane is a fearful Warlord, with a strong body and even stronger mind. he is clear, brutal and absolutely brilliant. unlike the Joker he doesn't want to prove a point, he wants to destroy. He is psychical and scary. he might not be the joker, but Bane is the biggest threat Gothan's ever faced. thanks to this movie Bane became one of my favorite movie villeins. My only problem with the Dark Knight is that Batman himself isn't all that interesting. Rise present a much more interesting Batguy, that has to deal with mental issues as well as psychical. For the first time I felt that the hero has zero chance at winning. Bale gives it his best in the role of the broken Bruce Wayne. there are a lot of characters in Rises and everyone feels important and relevant thanks to impressive acting on all fronts. JGL and Hathaway surprised in there excellence. Kane, Freeman and Oldman are terrific as always. Hardy steels the show by creating a terffing Bane out of his eyes and body language. there are so much to this movie, and it's hard to take it all in in the first time. The action has a strong emotional tone and the climax is absolutely breathtaking. Strong soundtrack with unique spin (the Bane chant), combined with the amazing cinematography gives it the Epic tone it needs. Some problems like plot holes keeps it from being better then it's predecessor , but there almost insignificant compared to the heights this movie soars to The Dark Knight Rises is an ambitious epic that ends Nolan's masterful trilogy with style and rises above and beyond a superhero movie ever dared. Final score- 9.5\10"
the film is about 8 years after Harvey dents death and batman taking the fall for Harveys crimes then a terrorist leader bane tries to destroy the city and batman is back to protect it.everyone in it that grant him as an enemy .oscar award winner Christin bale(the fighter public enemy's) Morgan freeman(se7en the shaw shank redemption) Gray old man and tom Hardy(inception warrior) are all in this film and there all one of my most favorite actors. this film isn't just one of the best movies of 2012 its one of the best movies in the world.the film has a lot of amazing action scenes some new people in this batman series this has great drama and story a must see to anyone who us to the watch batman all the time and still like the movies go and see this its brilliant and finally batman fights a terrorist rather than criminals i give it a 10/10.this should be number 4 of the top 250 brilliant
"I wanted to truly enjoy Dark Knight Rises.

I honestly did. I wanted to appreciate the grand direction, the excellent acting performances, superb cinematography, obvious amount of effort, and excellent wrapping of a trilogy that revived Batman and DC Comics from the Quality Dead.

I wanted to appreciate the obvious (and subtle) nods to the classic Batman comics and other works of literature. I wanted to appreciate and truly adore the way they fleshed out the Batman arc with containing story lines of the other two installments. I wanted to truly engulf myself in all this and hail this as the ultimate chapter in arguably the greatest superhero trilogy in the history of film.

However..

I can't get past the fact that the running time was zooming past 160 minutes, when 30 minutes could easily have been cut. I can't get past the fact that the appearance of Batman himself was reduced to just a couple appearances, getting far less screen time than many secondary characters (especially the villains Catwoman and Bane). I can't also get past the fact that Batman is contradicting some of his fiercest creeds. Rather ironic that two of our biggest criticisms of the 1989 version of Batman were happening here. I can't also get past the fact that within the first half hour, there were about four story lines rummaging around and we had to wait until the end of the entire first act to even get the Dark Knight.

What most strikes me about Dark Knight Rises is that the utter lack of catharsis. The trilogy has always suffered from this, replacing payoff moments with moment after moment of despair. The gloom and doom of Batman works as long we have smaller tuned moments to exhale and relax the nerves. Dark Knight Rises has absolutely none of this throughout the nearly-three hour affair. Yes Batman is the antithesis of your Marvel heroes, but a little humor and deviance from the main conflict couldn't hurt the movie. Even Spider-Man 2 in the midst of all Peter's dramas still had the escapades at the Daily Bugle to infuse some relief into the movie.

While the ending definitely redeems the preceding hour of tragedy and tension with plenty of twists and surprises (Thank goodness), and the final act was far better than the first two, I still can't help but miss the fun of the superhero subculture. Dark Knight Rises is definitely a well-crafted finale to the massive story arc, but it's not exactly a ride you'll want to experience over and over again."
I love this movie 10/10 I loved every second of this movie!
Christopher Nolan returns to seal the legendary saga with one of the greatest superhero movies as well as a classic movie masterpiece without descriptive cinematic beauty. This is a 10/10 movie.
"""The Dark Knight Rises"" leaves the fanciful early days of the superhero genre far behind, and moves into a doom-shrouded, apocalyptic future that seems uncomfortably close to today's headlines. As urban terrorism and class warfare envelop Gotham and its infrastructure is ripped apart, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) emerges reluctantly from years of seclusion in Wayne Manor and faces a soulless villain as powerful as he is. The film begins slowly with a murky plot and too many new characters, but builds to a sensational climax. Bane, played by Tom Hardy in a performance evoking a homicidal pro wrestler, is a mystery because it's hard to say what motivates him. He releases thousands of Gotham's criminals in a scenario resembling the storming of the Bastille. As they face off against most of the city police force in street warfare, Bane's goal seems to be the overthrow of the ruling classes. But this would prove little if his other plan succeeds. Bane stages two other sensational set pieces, involving destroying the Stock Exchange and blowing up a football stadium, that seemed aimed at our society's twin gods of money and pro sports. No attempt is made to account for Bane's funding and resources, and when it finally comes down to Bane and Batman going mano-a-mano during a street fight, it involves an anticlimactic fist-fight. This is a dark and heavy film; it tests the weight a superhero movie can bear. That Nolan is able to combine civil anarchy, mass destruction and a Batcycle with exercise-ball tires is remarkable. That he does it without using 3D is admirable. That much of it was shot in the 70mm IMAX format allows it to make that giant screen its own. That it concludes the trilogy is inevitable; how much deeper can Nolan dig? It lacks the near-perfection of ""The Dark Knight"" (2008), it needs more clarity and a better villain, but it's an honorable finale. The actual location is in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India, and we get a glimpse of some zigzagging stairs that are unforgettably shown in ""Baraka."" Turns out Bane was held there as a child."
"I signed up for IMDb just to make this review. The batman movies have gotten better progressively, and The Dark Knight Rises doesn't fail to please me. It's literally one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is the first batman movie that has made me cry. The movie will pull you in emotionally and take you for a ride. Forget what you knew about the two other new batman movies, this one is powerful.

I don't like giving perfect scores for things, but this movie deserves it. Even Braveheart would have scored a 9 in my book, and Braveheart is hard to beat. Action, romance, drama, cinematography, intelligence, suspense. When Catwoman kissed Batman the final time, you could feel it. She's a beautiful woman, but her acting is hard to beat. She latched onto him like it was all real. That's not really a spoiler, as it's not important to the plot at all.

I could draw many comparisons to V for Vendetta as well for the plot. But this movie had more punch.

I don't buy movies... ever, but when The Dark Knight Rises comes out to blu ray, i'm buying it, maybe i'll buy it for everyone I know."
"My goodness. What's up with everyone dissecting every single detail of this movie? Yes this movie has flaws, yes it's not perfect, yes it does have minor issues, but put all that aside and enjoy the picture. Once you sit back and enjoy, you can truly see what an achievement this movie is! It's definitely not better than the Dark Knight (the gold standard for comic book movies) but sure better than Batman Begins. This movie is an outstanding production and Nolan & his team definitely deserve massive praise for delivering one of the best conclusions to a movie trilogy.

A solid 9/10."

!! its a must watch movie for everybody!! it'll make you proud for being a batman fan!!

thank you SO much Nolan for this gift :)"
"When Watching 'The Dark Knight' in 2008, I thought by far this is one of the best superhero films ever made and stayed very true to the Batman law, with the characters and how they developed during the film. Basically the film set a high standard for itself, now comes along the sequel 'The Dark Knight Rises', equally as good as the last film. One of the great things that Christopher Nolan did in this series of films is that he got back a superb cast of Actors. Christian Bale once again delivers with his powerful voice as Batman, Michael Cain also delivered as Alfred the Butler, However I thought the new people that came in, Tom Hardy as Bane and Anne Hathaway as Salina Kyle/Catwoman, did very well in their rolls. I thought the characters synchronised with each other perfectly and definitely well written. Also to add as well, is that during the film, you could feel the emotion and the hurt which was Hollow which I loved about the Batman. Another good factor about this film was definitely the action, especially when we see the Batman and Bane face off for the first time, you get a sense of tension ravaging through your body while watching the sequence, this is why this film is unique, you wouldn't it was a superhero film at times as well and by saying that, it is actually one of the best superhero films. Unlike the joker in the last film, Bane delivers something different towards the Batman which is ferocity and Physical strength and you do get the idea in your head and doubt that, how can Batman win against something like Bane, which I loved about the film. To conclude,Even though the last film 'The Dark Knight' did set a high standard of greatness, 'The Dark Knight Rises' has matched it's older brother. Undoubtedly one of the best superhero film's, Christopher Nolan has done A fantastic job with The Batman iteration 9/10 Alex Rabbitte."
"I really don't see what all the fuss was about with The Dark Knight Rises. Like The Dark Knight, it was a good story and the acting was solid, but it was not great. Batman Begins is the under-rated film of this trilogy, it was the best, mostly because it was not trying so hard to be more than it really is.

But for this installment. Most movies lately have been edited half to death, presumably to make them run no longer than 90 minutes out of fear of losing audiences with shrinking attention spans. The Dark Knight Rises swings far to the other side, it is in desperate need of some editing. A few sequences are painfully drawn-out, many are just a bit draggy.

Additionally, while the movie attempts to be psychological and complex (quite successfully in some scenes), some rather juvenile elements interrupt the storyline. Other scenes try so hard to be deep that they border on being a spoof, making you wonder if the screenwriters are laughing at themselves (and the audience) a little.

Lastly, the actions scenes are mostly flat. They are not bad or outlandish as many comic book action scenes are, they just are not very interesting. Most of the fights are little more than boxing matches where you don't even see much of the actual contact of the hits. And you always know how the fight will end before it starts.

That said, it has some excellent elements as well. Some of the new characters are dynamic and interesting. The overall ""feel"" of the movie, including lighting, music, & special effects, are spot on, adding to the story without being distracting.

In the end the movie has it's ups & downs, but is certainly worth your time... just not all the fuss that has been made of it."
"From the beginning, I have appreciated ""the crime epic"" or ""the crime saga"" approach of the director towards Batman, despite I don't stick with realism in cinema, however in this movie, Nolan goes too far and we watch a movie which has almost zero effect on the audience as a Batman movie! What Roland Emmerich did in 2012 is what Nolan did in this movie! I don't pay to watch a crime film without Batman! In TDKR, Batman is like a metaphor, yes believe me, in the first half (80 minutes approx.) we watch Batman in only one or two scenes and the part (the chase) was may be the best part of the movie! As some other moviegoers said, it is all about story telling with no break, but no break! You can't feel the film, because it is like you have no time to do that! How can I say, the movie is exhausting, you feel exhausted, yes that's the word! And if you suppose that in the second half, Batman rises immediately, my answer would be not exactly! As said, TDKR is about Bruce Wayne, other characters, themes, but not Batman! Therefore I felt cheated. And I always think that Mr. Nolan is not a good action director. In the first half, Batman has an interesting gadget, I have no idea what was the function of it, but he doesn't use it! So? Yes, the movie has plenty good action, it has its moments, but I can't say it is great! Nolan shoots chase scenes, in all of his Batman movies, there is chase sequence, but is this enough? There are some other type of action in TDKR, but don't expect an action-packed! (I'd expected) There is no character development for new characters except for Bane. As for Catwoman, Catwoman is not even spelled in the movie! Was she really Catwoman? What was her motivation? She was not a dominant character as it should be! Even the introduction of the character was poor! And she could have been sexy! We can't see even her body! A different interpretation? well, the problem here is Nolan doesn't care about the characters, it was the same in Batman Begins (Scarecrow) it was the same in The Dark Knight (Batman himself) He just puts a character forward, Catwoman, a burglar, OK next! Miranda Tate, a business woman, OK next! Something like that. John Blake is a well written character, a cop, at least he has a motivation! However, for example Miranda Tate is out of place! It feels like Nolan likes Cotillard and wants to work with her, they know each other from Inception etc. Mrs. Cotillard is a very beautiful and talented actress, but in this movie, she is just out of place. Bane is the scene stealer, the performance of Tom Hardy is great, his voice is brilliant, he is evil, he is bad-ass, but he disappoints because of two reasons: first, as you know too, in Nolan's story, Bane doesn't use steroids or he isn't exposed to poison known as venom, so he doesn't grow bigger. Second, the twist at the end ruins this character very badly and there is a scene which you feel like he is a henchman! And wasn't Bane big like in the comics in the teaser trailer? Was I cheated again? The final parts which are called climactic by a lot of people were not that climactic and there is nothing different or original! I expected to be amazed, surprised etc. but it didn't happen. This is a cold movie! The movie has not any impact on you, you can't feel the film, almost zero emotion throughout the film (like Inception) but except two part! The fight between Batman and Bane and the chase in the first half! If the whole film had been like that, I would have given 100 out of 10! The cinematography and the art direction are not dominant like The Dark Knight, the editing is like non-stop events with no break (now joke time! the only break was the regular 10 minutes break in the middle of the movie!) Also the film was too noisy at times. I didn't find the movie overlong, but what I get bored was watching a Batman movie without Batman! I found Batman Joker showdown in The Dark Knight anti climactic, low key and short, but this time it was much worse! That's why movies like Terminator 2 are masterpieces, am I wrong? You can't imagine how it ends! I almost found it ridiculous! TDKR is not a ""rich"" film especially in the content, so it is like ""poor man's Batman movie"" Personally my another problem with TDKR was it has zero ""comic book feel"" At least, TDK had it at times! After some statements of Nolan, the fate of John Blake made me laugh! Miranda Tate's climactic plan was boring and how can I say? it had no excitement or tense, because it was simple and cliché? Especially for such an ""epic"" movie! Doesn't this epic final deserve originality? By the way, Nolan doesn't even know how to shoot a snowy scene or he just doesn't care about it! Another problem, the mystery and suspense in the trailers were missing. And realism doesn't mean that the movie is deep or in comparison with other super hero movies, it is deeper, No, No! That's because Nolan is not interested in characters, instead he is ""event driven"" And couldn't the war between Batman and the other bad guys (the chaos) be handled better? The only good thing about this movie for me was Nolan avoids ""crowd-pleaser humor"" in this movie! The Dark Knight Rises may be a well made film, but as a ""Batman"" movie, it is quite empty."
"I believe that TDKR is the best out of the trilogy, though the BB and TDK are both excellent, TDKR manages to perfectly capture the essence of Bruce Wayne and Batman in a way we would probably never see again, Bale gives a performance which shows just how brilliant an actor he is, even when most of his face is hidden by the mask, he manages to not only express the determination and anger of Batman, but also Batman's anxiety, I felt his performance in TDK became overshadowed by praise that was heaped upon the late Heath Ledger, but now I hope everyone can praise him for the brilliant actor he is. I believe the supporting cast are also great and that no actor was below par, even though it took a bit of time to adjust to Bane's voice.

Christopher Nolan has given us one of the greatest trilogy's of all time and has finished with a tour de force of a film, which is both challenging and entertaining, the reliance on stunts and little use of CGI made the film feel grittier and more intense, while Wally Pfister has given us in what could be his last film as a DP some of his finest work and that chant which is heard when Bane approaches will forever send a chill down my spine no matter how many times I see it. TDKR managed to surpass my expectations, every minute of it was worth watching.

Lastly I just want to send my condolences to the victims, as well as their family and friends, of the tragic event in Colorado, may they rest in peace."
"When I watched the trailers, I knew that Christopher Nolan would make a perfect movie, the storyline is amazing and will always make you want to jump of the chair and be in the movie. The movie is long but when it ends you will wish that it would never end. And the soundtrack it's just pure adrenalin, it will transform you in Batman. The Dark Knight had Heath Legder as a perfect Joker but Christopher Nolan managed to create a villain at the same lever as the Joker. Bane is Mr. muscles that can kill everyone on his path and the Joker is just evil in person, two distinct villains that are just perfect. One last thing Bane's voice is just badass epic."
"The Dark knight Rises, was in some ways, the perfect ending to a great trilogy. This $250,000,000 action filled creation of Nolan is a perfect testimony of his sheer genius and imagination. The only possible reason it cannot be termed as ground breaking is because the grounds were already broken in 2008 by ""The Dark knight"". This movie was as spell bounding as its predecessor. Massive in its scope and breath-taking in its conception, the Dark Knight Rises explores the character of Bruce Wayne a.k.a The Batman in the backdrop of a now peaceful Gotham. It is set 7 years after the death of Harvey Dent. Bruce Wayne is shown as a man who is broken, both physically and spiritually by the antics of the Joker. Christopher Nolan with his portrayal of the masked crusader has done a superb job of showing us the anguish and struggles Batman was going through. On one hand Bruce was still broken by the death of Rachel and on the other his Gotham city was threatened by Bane (Tom Hardy). Apart from challenges Batman had to face ,Bruce Wayne also had to bear the brunt of a bad investment in a clean energy project. Subsequent events led him to bankruptcy. The movie is about these challenges Bruce faces and how he has to find a balance in life and rise from the darkness that surrounded him. The Portrayal of Bane was done superbly by Tom Hardy, as an insane mercenary whose only aim was destruction of Gotham. There is also a connection between Bane and Bruce which is later revealed in the movie. The ever faithful Alfred (Michael Caine) and Mr Fox (Morgan Freeman) who always had Bruce's back do so again. Their prime task was to put forth the difficult questions which Bruce had to answer, questions pertaining to his past and future. And the cat women played by Anne Hathway was a character who had her own set of moral values, but at the end of the day she plays an equally important part in the future of Gotham city.

In the most elemental sense The Dark Knight Rises is about the fight between good and evil. What is amazing is the execution of the movie and the flawless way Nolan explores the character of Batman. And a word of praise should be given for the music which gives the viewer a rush of adrenaline during some unforgettable scenes. Shot in 5 difference countries this multimillion masterpiece is undoubtedly the crown jewel of Nolan's Batman Trilogy."

I don't normally write reviews for IMDb, but I feel like contributing to the great community here. I publish most of my reviews on youtube if you want to watch them here -> http://www.youtube.com/user/natdude101? feature=mhee

Batman is a character that film has been nice to. Great films from the late 80's/early 90's, wonderful animated films and an extremely successful reboot of the franchise in the 2000's. While he has seen his dark days (no pun intended), everyone knows that Batman is a profitable character. The Dark Knight Rises seems to follow it's successors having already broke many records. But no matter how much money a movie makes, it can still suck. Many wonder whether or not to watch film and with this review I hope to help people make the decision to see TDKR.

TDKR starts off strong. The plot opens up 8 years after the events of the previous movie where Harvey Dent is a hero and Bruce Wayne is a crippled shut in. The opening is a bit slow and possibly slower than most people would expect from such a action-heavy film, but it does pick up after the first 45 minutes. The casting for the film is excellent. The returning cast featuring Bale, Oldman, Caine and Freeman all make a wonderful cast. The new people also leave an impression. Hardy and Hathaway steal the show as the villain/anti-hero and Gordon-Levitt does a great job as the new cop on the force. I feel like this film has more a focus on the entire ensemble rather than a featured star (Batman in Batman Begins and The Joker in The Dark Knight). The plot is also well written and provides an excellent ending to the dark knight trilogy.

The Cinematography is breathe-takingly beautiful. Many scenes have been shot with an imax camera and that extra effort has helped make the film all the more amazing. Action scenes look especially good. The special and visual effects also look good, but the film doesn't rely on them to work. Unlike the other super-hero movie release of July, TDKR is able to stand on it's own without the special effects. The soundtrack is very well-written. Composer Hans Zimmer has done an excellent job again creating a haunting and beautiful soundtrack to accompany this film. The sound editing and mixing is one of the few problems I have with the film, while it's usually excellent, the beginning has a few problems as it's very hard to understand Hardy due to his mask.

The Script is very well written and brings together an excellent theme of pain and sacrifice. Nolan has once again outdone himself with directing this picture. Fight scenes are perfectly choreographed. Camera angles are set perfectly. Every line is delivered with the perfect amount of intensity and passion. The only question left is, how in the world has this world-class director not won an academy award?

Overall, TDKR is one of the best films of the year. Everything works so well and if you'll excuse some of the minor problems in the beginning, you'll find an excellent film that builds to one of the most satisfying endings in all of film. I highly recommend it."
"I booked tickets for the midnight screening of this movie on the day they came out. and the next month after that was an excruciating wait. I had never looked forward to a movie this much, not because im not a massive movie fan but because I could never truly have faith in any director being able to produce the masterpiece I would be expecting.

but with Christopher Nolan, I just knew i was going to receive something mind numbingly good, something I would remember for the rest of my life. I walked out of dark knight with a feeling of satisfaction but after watching the dark knight rises I felt something no other movie had provided me thus far.

Truly an amazing movie, needless to say my favourite of all time. anyone who hasn't seen this movie needs to. you will not regret it."
Expectations after The Dark Knight were so high that the end of the trilogy has left a really bad taste for me. I loved the 1st 2 films immensely and was a huge Nolan fan until now. It makes me sick that ultimately they decided to cash in their cheque. I can't believe the positive reviews this is getting. Did I watch a different movie? The inclusion of the Catwoman was a disaster. Bane could have made this a decent sequel had Nolan concentrated on him a lot more. I don't have words left to describe my disappointment. Not buying this on Blu Ray. For me It started with Batman begins and ended with The Dark Knight. Real talk people. Watch The Avengers at the pictures now while you still can. You will not regret it.
"This Batman film is the worst out of this Trilogy.

It takes over an hour for the movie to get going, when it finally does it is still boring.

The enemy is not even scary and very cheesy. The worst part of the movie is that is all so unbelievable, the director makes you think you have the brain of a three year old. I like very clever directing where you are made to think and put things together like with Quentin Tarentino. The directing here was very basic and for kids, it was so cheesy and so many clichés. Basically it has all been done before in the other batman films and done a lot better too. The last one is in the series is mean to be the best but this was the worst - the batman series has been totally exhausted , there was nothing original or exciting in the whole film.

The whole film is cheesy, i went with my friends who love the other batman films and not one of them like this.

Forget the 10 star reviews this film is Boring and cheesy

The only redeeming feature is cat woman is sexy but overall the film is so slow and drawn out."
"Desi desi basara basara...desi desi basara basara. I loved the chanting throughout the movie. This movie will blow you away. Nolan has done it again and this time better.

It couldn't be a spectacular end to an immortal saga. People say that the third outing is always tricky as there is lot of pressure to present a convincing plot for the audience in a way that the trilogy culminates into one phenomenal celluloid experience. Nolan has undoubtedly, outdone himself with his latest film which also happens to be the last in the Batman franchise.

Every character in this movie have given there best performances till date. Hans Zimmer's magical music is still giving me goosebumps. This is the best Superhero film i've seen. Nolan's twist can be felt in the movie which will always keep you on the edge of your seat. Its a Must Watch movie..not only once but many a times. Take a bow Christopher Nolan.

Desi Desi Basara basara!!!!"
"The Dark Knight Rises, as most know, is the finale of Chrisopher Nolan's Batman trilogy that began with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. You have to ask yourself though, is the series plagued? I saw this in light of recent events with the Colorado shootings and Heath Ledger's untimely death in 2008.

However, The Dark Knight Rises is THE movie to watch in 2012:

It features stunning performances from Christian Bale who reprises his role as the protagonist Batman, Anne Hathaway as Catwomen and namely Michael Caine's portrayal of Bruce's servant Alfred. Caine gives an excellent performance in the movie mainly an emotional moment towards the closing scenes of the film (no spoilers here). Tom Hardy's performance as the villain Bane arguably competes with Ledger's performance as The Joker in The Dark Knight, You can feel the terror that Bane inflicts.

The story itself (whilst giving away no spoilers) features plenty of emotional moments and plot twists galore, 10/10 from this reviewer.

Summary: One of the best films this year has scene, definitely beating The Amazing Spider Man, where Super-Hero movies of 2012 are concerned: See this movie!"
"""The Dark Knight Rises"" was the one movie that was a must-see on my list. After the crowd-pleasing and stunning ""The Dark Knight"" it seemed almost impossible for a sequel to top its predecessor. With a phenomenal performance by Heath Ledger as The Joker, and such a captivating story, it would be difficult to capitalize on that right? Director Christopher Nolan takes the audience on another journey and its one that will have audiences glued to there seat for nearly 3 hours. ""Rises"" does clock in at around 2 hours and 45 minutes to be exact, but it's worth every single minute.

What I've always found fascinating about Nolan as a director is that all of his films have a common theme: redemption. ""The Dark Knight"" touched on that aspect of corruption and humanity taking a stand; even the nicest person can be corrupted with the right push, hence Harvey Dent. ""Rises"" tackles the issue of economic inequality, terrorism and destruction to speak. Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) is a billionaire; he's not just wealthy, but very wealthy. His wealth gives him the opportunity to suit up as Batman and have incredible toys at his disposal.

"Christopher Nolan is yet to deliver an unsatisfying film, and he absolutely hit the nail on the head with the last installment in the batman series. For a 3 hour movie, i know I and many other were up in our seats enthralled for whatever was going to happen next.

Christian Bale was magnificent as always. I enjoyed how Nolan brought out a more emotional side to Bruce Wayne on a more personal level. It was nice how there was more Bruce Wayne bettering himself and others around him, while still maintaining the Batman we know and love.

Anne Hathaway absolutely exceeded expectations as Selina Kyle/Catwoman. Her lustful/cunning personality was performed flawlessly and her transformation was performed even better. She brought a somewhat warm comical aspect to a movie embezzled with darkness, that added something to the batman series us as viewers were yet to see.

Tom Hardy as Bane provided a new villainous tone that i enjoyed. He was a true villain. He was physically dominant, with intelligence as well presenting scenarios where you did not know how Batman would be able to cope. The voice he provided, just as Heath Ledger had done, was nailed. Creepy and truly villainous. Bane was just as good as the joker in their own way.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt's role as officer Blake is overlooked for how key his role was. This young man is establishing himself as a true actor in Hollywood. His passion for Batman and the people of Gotham was extremely evident and you were rooting for this guy throughout the entire film.

Michael Caine never fails to deliver, and Alfred's riveting, emotional performance put me over the edge. He made me feel for his character, feel what he was going through exactly. A huge reason this movie was so successful was the performance of Alfred.

TDKR was a perfect way to end this historic trilogy with its powerful acting performances and the emotions poured out throughout the film. It just saddens me that this series is over due to the ending really sets up another film. Christopher Nolan i applaud you and the work you have done."
"It is almost impossible for anybody to make a sequel to the ever lasting and epic movie like THE DARK KNIGHT. With history of films which failed to create same impact as their previous versions and with huge amount of expectations THE DARK KNIGHT RISES do rise to the expectations.

Hats off to Christopher Nolan. He has done a great job in assembling such a huge cast ,many(new characters) of them are from his previous directional venture INCEPTION. to their credit everyone has done their role neatly.Christian Bale looked stunning and did his role nicely, Anne Hathaway added some attraction and value to her role especially with her venomous style and attitude. Joseph Gordon-Levitt proved his worth and confidence that Nolan had in him.

the major positives are the screenplay, camera work, high octane action sequences, stunning and timely dialogues. the bgm was good as one can expect from a batman movie.

on the downside, the length of the movie which is quite unusual for a Hollywood movie, but trust me you will never get bored.

the twists and turns in later part makes it more interesting and the climax is the best part. very much acceptable and justified conclusion to this epic trilogy. I have watched it twice on its release day but still love to watch it again. It is very difficult to chose the best among the trilogy especially between dark knight and dark knight rises. frankly i couldn't chose the better one . Thank u warner bros and Christopher Nolan for giving us this awesome series. I hope its not a one time experience."
"The Dark Knight Rises: Ever since Nolan delivered The Dark Knight, it has been a long impatient wait for four long years for its sequel. Let us be honest here-The Dark Knight was a masterpiece but it was Heath Ledger's portrayal of Joker which had made the film iconic. Anybody can make a masterpiece but it is only a handful of those who make iconic movies, and Nolan made it. Christopher Nolan, take a bow. The Dark Knight Rises is another masterstroke from Nolan. Though there might be nothing iconic about this one but certainly it brings justice to the kind of finale one might expect from a person of his caliber. The only unfortunate thing about TDKR is that it is being released after The Dark Knight. Had this movie been released after Batman Begins, it would have brought order in this universe where one movie is a step ahead of its predecessor (surprise>>>>masterpiece>>>>iconic). People would have appreciated this masterpiece as a worthy sequel and not point fingers at it just because it is not there with TDK. That being said let us now come to TDKR. Since I was not able to get tickets online for the nearby 15 odd multiplexes, I had to earn a ticket for it to see it 25kms away. I could imagine myself walking in slow motion into the theatre, with tickets clenched in my hands (fade loud noise), to witness something which will tell you-that seat on which you are about to sit has waited there for decades for you to witness this orchestra, after all it has been a wait for a lifetime. This movie has everything what you expect from a Nolan movie. I will not undermine it by saying this movie has great acting, great screenplay and everything cliché. But I will say this-experience this experience, for after this there will be none and even if there is who knows who will be and who will not be."
"I have almost no words for this Masterpiece. It was just a perfect end to The Dark Knight Legend. With Blood Rushing Action and beautifully Choreographed Fight Scenes. This was one of the Greatest Movies Ever Conceived. Bane was pure evil with a side that was revealed that I didn't expect. Miranda Tate was just something different, that's all I'll say. And of course Christian Bale playing the greatest superhero ever; Batman. He was just sensational. Pure Amazing acting. Christopher Nolan is one of the Greatest Directors of All Time and easily the Greatest one right now. 10/10, 110%, Six Stars! Must See! This Movie will change Series Finales Forever."
"Really? a 9 out of 10? Something must be wrong... it surely is an entertaining film but the amount of plot holes, clichés and lack of coherence / logic in many of the scenes is totally overwhelming.

Will you have fun watching it? YES, it is a fun movie. Is it a great movie? NO, not even close.

It's not even a shadow of the second movie (which I believe is also a bit overrated, but still was a really good film).

I still recommend watching it, as it is quite fun, but don't expect ""The Godfather part 4"", as you might from some of the reviews and the 9.0 rating..."
"Overlong, talky and boring.....

And who had the idea of having a villain with a art-deco ashtray on his mouth? Bane is one of the most poorly developed villains in history. What were they thinking? What is the point of hiding is face and facial expressions?

The dialog is painful, tedious. The film is overlong, bloated, they tried to pack too much into it and the result is very confusing.

Anne Hathaway in unconvincingly flimsy looking. Not to mention she has no charisma, chemistry with Batman.

Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine (the coolest characters) are given minimal screen time.

I rather watch Adam West's Batman. At least it was fun."
"Awesome. Best of the trilogy but doesn't set itself apart from the first 2. Its long but the time flew by. Directing was spot on and everybody played their parts perfectly. I thought I was going to have a gripe with Bane not bulking up the way he does in the comics but I'm delighted he didn't. Hardy played the part superbly, you still get the feeling he is crazy strong and smart, and Hardy is hardly a small fella so hats off to him pulling the part off as well as he did without the aid of a muscle suit. Bale was again brilliant as Wayne/Batman, honestly couldn't pick a fault with anyone's performance. That ending blew me away too, you just know what's coming next if they decide to make another :-) Best feeling was leaving the IMax pumped up about it, then remembering the big reveal in the film I should have gotten way before it happened having read Batman for nearly 4 decades, but I reckon I could watch it again and still be excited at the reveal. Only down point in this film was that it ended...."
"This movie will blow you away. Nolan has done it again; this time, better. A brilliant array of cinematic magic to bring an outstanding superhero to the big screen. I was fortunate to be able to attend a screening of this spectacular movie. A must watch and a truly astonishing thrill.The Dark Knight Rises is phenomenal and makes other superhero movies look like rubbish. Comparing this movie to previous parts in the franchise - this particular film is of a much greater level. The acting displays are superb and Bane's role is particularly astonishing. Nolan has taken brilliance to a whole new level. A must watch for anyone. 9/10."
"I just saw TDKR a few hours ago, and I'm still not sure how much I like the movie. All I know is that, Nolan has not let us down. Although anyone expecting this movie to be better than The Dark Knight may walk out of the theater disappointed. Without spoiling too much, the plot is more or less what you may expect from the trailers.

After eight years of peace, Batman unsuccessfully comes out of retirement to stop Bane who is hell bent of destroying Gotham and manages to get himself trapped in an impossible-to-escape prison while Bane and his cronies take over the city. We are greeted with a host of familiar and new faces. Despite the number of characters, Nolan actually manages to give each individual a fair amount of depth and gravitas. And astonishingly, no one disappoints.

Anne Hathaway adds a large degree of respectability to the character of Selina Kyle /Catwoman without ever being over the top and shares a sizzling chemistry with Bale every time they are together on screen. Joseph Gordon-Levitt as John Blake is a nuanced performance where he balances strength and vulnerability without ever being unbelievable. Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate is understated and plays an important role as the only woman after Rachel Dawes that Bruce Wayne cares about. The rest of the supporting cast also brings their A-game. A special mention for Gary Oldman as Gordon, who remains one of my favorite characters in the trilogy. His performance as a helpless bystander to the failing system of Gotham evokes a sense of genuine empathy. Finally coming to Tom Hardy as Bane, its impossible to not compare his character to Heath Ledger's Joker which is what will distract most people from understanding the true nature of the character which is very different from that of the Joker. Hardy does a commendable job with a menacing, physical presence but Ledger set the bar so high that it was never going to be possible to match up to it.

But in the end, it is the story and the direction that come out supreme. Nolan has pulled out all the stops to make this an entertaining yet meaningful movie which ties up the loose ends and he succeeds for the most part. Despite a few inconsistencies he manages to draw you in with a mixture of action, special effects, philosophy and even a little bit of humour, something which was sorely missed in the Dark Knight. Themes of social inequality, cause and effect, the blurriness of the lines between good and evil have all been played out beautifully although a little subtlety would have been much more effective.

At 2 hours 45 mins, this is the longest Batman movie to date and believe me, it doesn't feel that long. Despite a slow start, the movie builds towards a heart stopping climax and brilliant use of Macguffins throughout the movie make this one the best movies made in a long time but is edged out by its predecessor, by a hair's breadth. Chris Nolan, take a bow, for TDKR is a fitting end to one of the best trilogies ever made."
"Christopher Nolan has done it again. They say the third outing is always tricky as there is awful lot of pressure to present a convincing plot for the audience in a way that the trilogy culminates into one phenomenal celluloid experience. Nolan has undoubtedly, outdone himself with his latest film which also happens to be the last in the Batman franchise.

It is tough to imagine that a comic strip could have such a poignant and an incredibly spell binding movie transformation. You remain fixed to your seats through the entire run of this 2 hours 45 minutes dark action thriller.

Right from the first installment of the franchise- 'Batman Begins' to 'The Dark Knight Rises', the director has maintained the same tone and feel of the film, with the antagonist having an overwhelmingly terrifying influence on viewers with their mean and unfathomable manipulative schemes. While Joker of 'The Dark Knight', played impeccably by late Heath Ledger, won more accolades from viewers for his eccentric devilish act than Batman played by Christian Bale, this time round we have even more dangerous and evil adversary of the caped crusader in the form of Bane (Tom Hardy) who is not only intelligent but far more strong and agile than our hero.

The story unfolds eight years after the death of district attorney Harvey Dent who in pursuit to completely eradicate organized crime from the Gotham city loses his life under double dealing circumstances at the hands of Batman. Police Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) is convinced that crime has severely been curbed following Dent's death. But at some other place there has risen Bane who is hell bent on bringing Gotham city down by presenting the most daunting picture of organized crime by degrading contemporary societal trends. Exploiting on the crumpled economic situation of Gotham and the rich-poor divide, Bane, the 'terrorist' plans a very conniving plot to take Gotham city under siege challenging Batman to come out of his shell.

Meanwhile, the Dark Knight of the city aka Batman has become a recluse taking the blame of Harvy Dent's death upon him. The film also has the 'Catwoman'(superbly played by Anne Hathway) who very tactfully manages to lure Batman to his most powerful opponent till date who in a fight overpowers Batman- even breaking his back and dumping him to rot.

Batman has to save his city and its people and he has to rise to the occasion. And in 'The Dark Knight Rises', Batman has to fight not only Bane but also his own self. He has to get rid of the guilt of killing Dent and his once fiancée Rachel and come to terms with the fact even if his ways of dealing with the warlords are in transgression with the city's administration; he is the ultimate savior of Gotham.

This film has some fine performances, from Gary Oldman as the exhausted yet perennially decent Commissioner Gordon to Joseph Gordon-Levitt as John Blake, a young cop who ends up at the heart of the action. Marion Cotillard and Anne Hathaway add glamour and intrigue.

Tom Hardy who plays Bane is someone to look out for in 'The Dark Knight Rises'. He's got a great character and he plays it with aplomb. But the screenplay and treatment of the story by director Nolan is the real deal.

Take a bow ladies and gentleman – for the maverick of Nolan rises again as he delivers a masterpiece called – 'The Dark Knight Rises'.

Ratings: TEN awesome cheers for this one!"
"I just saw a press screening of the Dark Knight Rises.

a) Blood Rushing Action And Excitement? b) Absolute Perfection? c) Just another Summer Blockbuster Movie?

That's what some of the reviews here on IMDb show as a summary.

I'm sorry to tell you that it's not a) or b) but only c). It is just another summer Blockbuster which was way too expensive.

A budget of USD 250.000.000 ? I wasn't impressed. Sure everything looked top notch and the effects or settings were visually done as good as it gets.But they left not one lasting impression with me. For this kind of money they really should have impressed the viewer.

Where was the action? When action took place it wasn't very spectacular, breathtaking or at least even cool.It was OK but that's it.

The soundtrack either didn't left a big impression with me.The main theme was the only part which sticked to my ears.

Why did almost every sentence one of the major characters uttered had to sound deep, meaningful or even philosophical?

Most of the time I felt sorry for the characters because none of them seemed to have lived a happy life.

I've read comic books all my life and I admit that I'm not such a big Batman Fan.I liked the Neal Adams Batman and the Frank Miller Dark Knight and some smaller story arcs but can't remember much else.

Still I think that the movie should have entertained me a lot more. The Dark Knight surely did so.

Gladly the ending put a smile on my face when leaving the theater. But considering a running time of 160 min. that's not very much I was left with.

To conclude it is not a bad movie but in my opinion it could have been much better."
"What the hell is wrong with people these days? Why does every impersonal, cliché, unremarkable movie instantly gets in the top 250? Let alone the top 10? I was rather entertained with the two previous movies, mainly thanks to Liam Nesson and Heath Ledger who are fantastic actors. Overrated movies in my opinion, but good enough movies. But there's nothing to save this movie from Nolan's lack of talent this time

Here are the flaws already present in the previous movie that have not been corrected, or got even worse:

-Batman's grunting, worse than ever. Jesus Christ you would think after all the mockery that's been done about it, he would at least try to improve that part a bit, but no it's actually more ridiculous than ever. - The music is omnipresent during the whole movie. It goes basically ""tchac boum tchac"" for all the movie, including the dialogue scenes. horrible artistic choice. - The action scenes, dull as hell. How can anyone fin this 'spectacular' is beyond me: there's no tension, intensity or drama in all of them. Nolan had too big a budget and decided to blow stuff up just for the hell of it.

But there are new flaws as well! - The villain's motivations, which was what made the previous film interesting, are just completely incoherent! I won't say much more not to spoil anything, but believe me you just spend the whole movie asking yourself: why? why do this? - The villain himself. Without spoiling anything, let's just say all his back-story and charisma is destroyed by one silly, silly twist. - The villains' deaths have to be the most underwhelming I've ever seen. - The references about the current economic crisis: awwww look at these evil traders getting pointed a gun at, didn't they totally deserve it? Yawn. - The love interest. Wayne just randomly has sex with a woman he's barely met. Why? no idea.

Overall this movie is dull as hell, and while I can see why people would like the first two movies, there really is nothing to save in that one."
"The batman trilogy should now be at stakes among the greatest trilogies in cinema history. It's third movie did not hesitate to give us what so much other's couldn't. The third film normally marks the last of the series, and for good reason. What Nolan has done has given us a final film, without good reason. From the opening scene, which, in my opinion, was better than the dark knights opening. The same cannot be said as far as the overall films. The dark knight was incredible, and left an amazing shadow to be filled. It was filled. I would say this is as good, but not better than The Dark Knight. It's truly an amazing feat.

All actor performances were top notch. I cannot think of a bad performance, only show stealer's. Most notably are: Michael Caine, who gave us an excellent performance unlike one we've seen Alfred give. Christian Bale did excellent, amazingly portraying Batman, but even more so the pain and suffering of Bruce Wayne. Anne Hathaway was the one I was a little worried about. She did amazing, damn near stealing the scenes she was in and giving the character a huge amount of realism. Tom Hardy as Bane was just about the best follow up to Heath Ledgers (may he rest in peace) Joker. Something happened while watching Bane that the Joker couldn't give me; I was terrified of him. The joker was the better preformed and more interesting villain, but Bane brought something to the table that was different than what the Joker had. Joesph Gordon Levitt and Gary Oldman both did excellent, as expected, in both their roles.

Christopher Nolan has said that Batman Begins is about Fear, The Dark Knight is about Chaos, and The Dark Knight Rises is about Pain. This is true. TDKR is probably one of the bleakest and best films I've seen a while. At one point, I wondered, how do you end Batman? How can they complete it?

This was a perfect ending. It is stunning how well they managed to wrap up something as big as the dark knight so phenomenally. Truly fantastic and not to be missed."
"Firstly and most importantly the story of this film is sublime. From the very start the normal narrative structure is disregarded, as with previous Nolan's work. The story starts off with a powerful, unforgettable plane hijacking scene introducing the masked villain Bane portrayed brilliantly by Tom Hardy. It then moves to the life of Bruce Wayne (8 years after the events of TDK) and the emptiness he now lives in with the death of Rachel on his conscience and the crimes of Harvey Dent which he chose to take the blame for, for the good of Gotham. This is until Bane strikes again and forces Batman into action, along with newcomer Selina Kyle aka. Catwoman. The story continues to unfold beautifully with surprises at every twist and turn building up to a mesmerzing sensational last hour and climax. Batman falls and 'rises' in this film as Bane takes full control of Gotham causing Bruce unbearable pain by making him witness his city burn helplessly.

The acting in this movie is a step up from the last film as the whole cast do a fantastic job whereas in the last one, for the most part Ledger stole the show. Christian Bale gives his best performance yet as Bruce Wayne who actually feels like a down-to-earth human being in this one and not a distant billionaire playboy. In this one we can feel his despair and learn even more about him with the help of the brilliant characterization and development, as he faces immense challenges he must overcome and learn the true meaning of ''Why do we fall?'' whatever the consequences. The fact even he can be 'broken' shows us despite how much of a symbol he is and what he stands for, he is still physically just a man and all men can fall. He deserves an Oscar nod. Moving on, Tom Hardy portrays the huge masked villain Bane superbly and through his marvelous performance it makes him a completely terrifying and menacing person who is not to be reckoned with, especially by showing how powerful he is when he 'breaks' Batman. The execution of his master plan is very intelligently done and despite Hardy's performance not being as spectacular as Ledger's, he still does a hell of a job and his character complexity still allows him to be in the same league as Ledger's Joker. Despite how much of a monstrous person he is made to look, by the end we see his human side which makes us like him if ever the slightest, as we see he is after all still human. Maybe Hardy doesn't deserve to win an Oscar for his role, depending on how good other year's performances are but he definitely should also get an Oscar nod. These being the two strongest performances of the film nevertheless doesn't mean the rest of the cast didn't also do a great job. Hathaway portrays cunning, sexy Catwoman engrossingly, Caine does a fantastic job as always, as does new-comer JGD (John Blake) and Gary Oldman as Gordon is excellent as per usual. Marion Cotillard is another new addition to the cast, portraying business woman Miranda Tate intriguingly who is more cunning of a character than she looks and will surprise you greatly by the end. All in all, applause to the cast.

The characterization and character development of the film, as briefly touched upon before, is astounding. Each of the key characters are distinctive, have their own backgrounds and strong personalities, even the new ones and each have a fair share of screen time. This is one of the most contributing factors which makes this if ever slightly better than TDK. The old characters we have gotten used to are developed further, Caine gives a staggeringly astonishing performance as Alfred, the charming friend and butler of Bruce and contributes quite a bit to parts of the story. Bruce also is developed further very well, as mentioned before, and Bale delivers a superb performance.

The themes and issues explored also add to this film being greater/better than TDK. Bane's plan can be interpreted/associated with the Occupy Wall Street movement, the banking crisis nowadays and whether capitalism is the right direction to stay on or should the system be changed to allow a new sense of order (not anarchy/chaos, just something other than what we have now). As well as this it poses some ideas about revolution and questions - whether there ever will be a fall of capitalism or western civilization, through whatever means. This film contributes greatly to the world today and a lot of symbolic elements fill the story, unlike most/if not all other superhero films.

Moving on to technical aspects, the action of the film is bigger and better than ever, orchestrated breath-takingly from the opening scene of the huge plane hijacking to thousands of people charging at each other through the torn apart streets of Gotham, filmed on Wall Street helping to give just the massive scale of the action. The sound editing as well as the music of Zimmer are better than ever, it can be slow and calm at parts and yet mind blowingly fast, loud, intense and completely electrifying in a large portions of the film. The FX are also astonishing, especially the fact most of them were real/practical and not CGI.

Now on to the ending of the film (without telling you what it is), I thought it was spectacular, unexpected and a wondrous sense of anonymity is left with the audience leaving the major themes, ideas and further story threads allowing the audience to wonder and decide what will happen next, whilst still being given enough to be satisfied and blown away with this truly epic conclusion to the DARK KNIGHT LEGEND. Not my favourite movie probably but close, still deciding though. A strong 10/10!"
"The Dark Knight Rises redefines epic film-making and Nolan shows why he is the best person to call the shots when it is a film based on the caped crusader. He retains the dark theme and goes on to successfully deal with the issues of loss,grief,terror,choice and one man's attempt to prevent his city from being destroyed. Definitely darker and more haunting than its predecessors,The Dark Knight Rises relies on spellbinding special effects,breathtaking action sequences and hard-hitting dialogues to establish its story. The Dark Knight Rises also throws some interesting new characters in the mix. Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Tom Hardy as Bane, Gary Oldman as Commissioner James Gordon, Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle/Catwoman and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Officer John Blake played their roles to perfection. Tom Hardy is brilliant as Bane, the physical figure of terror and unstoppable force.

This trilogy had it all - the first was about our inner fears, the second about chaos, and the third about pain! The ending has the audience gasping and that is where Nolan scores. That's why it's called an epic. That's why he's Batman. Everybody's hero. Hans Zimmer has delivered the best background score for this film in the entire trilogy. It is so riveting that it stays with you even after you have left the theater.

A ferociously satisfying end to The Dark Knight Trilogy. The thought of Nolan not returning for another Batman film is saddening but THE DARK KNIGHT RISES deserves the recognition of being the epic conclusion to the best superhero film trilogy of all time!!"
"The dark knight rises was such a great story and some reviews have said how slow it starts but i believe that just lets the build up so much better and there's been a lot of controversy about the ending but personally i loved it, and i believe i should take time out to give my condolences to the families of the people who were murdered in the midnight premier in Colorado but back on subject Christian bales acting was unbelievable and cat woman was a great asset to this movie some trilogies are horrible because of one movie ruining it but this is one of the greatest i have ever seen and just the way batman in this movie handled himself was beautiful and bane oh my god, what a great villain he literally scared me and i loved it so much about this movie I rate it 10 out of ten and I would recommend it to anyone."
"When the Dark Knight came out, I knew it was highly anticipated. However, I was surprised at just how successful it was. 8.9 on IMDb, smashing box office records, etc. I had very high expectations for it and it definitely met them. However, I admit I was very excited and my friends and I discussed the possibilities the movie could have and over- thought it to death. So when I finally saw the film, I couldn't help but feel slightly disappointed that some of my ideas didn't come to fruition. But that was my own fault for letting my expectations get undoubtedly high. The more times I watched the film, the more I enjoyed it. I did not think Christopher Nolan could top that.

When The Dark Knight Rises was finally put into production, I vowed to myself that I would not let my expectations get too high and that I wouldn't over-think the film again. Of course, I wound up doing that anyways. I was bursting at the seams for this film and did this film meet my expectations? No, it blew my expectations away completely. Anyone who saw the film and I asked what they thought; ""wow"" is all that came to their mind. I respond to the question ""Well, I don't want to over-sell it. But it was one of the greatest movies I've ever seen."" The acting is superb, better than the first two combined and they were both top-notch as well. (Seeing as how Heath Ledger won the Oscar for The Joker) the fact that the movie is promoted as the conclusion of a trilogy gives everything a very, shall we say ""Mortal"" feeling. Any beloved characters have the possibility of dying, as they need not be concerned with bringing them back for a sequel. Which gives the film a much more suspenseful feel. The film strikes a very human and emotional chord with not only Bruce Wayne and Alfred, but with all the characters including the villains. They are all humanized, all their motives are made clear. The film takes you to a very low emotional point, the most grim out of the three films (which is odd, it's usually second in a trilogy) to the point where it doesn't seem possible to come out of this dark place. However, the movie ""rises"" up from the misery and leads to a perfectly executed, beautiful and satisfying conclusion. Well done to Christopher Nolan, and all the cast. My two biggest regrets are that there won't be a sequel and there won't be a superhero movie done this well ever again. But I'd rather have a fantastic trilogy than have the series turn to crap as the previous franchise did.

P.S. Both Tom Hardy and Michael Caine deserve Oscars for their performances, but being the pretentious load of BS that is the Oscars, I doubt either of them will get nominated. I believe Heath Ledger, while completely deserving of winning the Oscar, only was because he passed away after the film was made. If either Hardy or Caine are nominated, then there may be hope for the Oscars. Even more so if one of them wins."
"The Dark Knight Rises follows along the lines of The Dark Knight. A superhero movie where the superhero is absent most of the time. Initially Wayne is crippled and recluse and Batman retired altogether. A bit of romantic teasing with a thief/Catgirl makes Wayne come back into the open. When a gang of thieves led by Bane attack the stock exchange, Batman returns to action. The attack bankrupts Wayne enterprises. Alfred resigns, leaving Wayne and Batman pretty much on their own. On top of that the person who Wayne picked to run Wayne Enterprises also turns on him. Then Catgirl deceives Batman and leads him to Bane's trap. As a result Wayne ends up in a prison/mine for another good chunk of the movie. In other words, this is again a Batman movie without much of Batman.

Eventually he manages to escape--to rise out of the ground. By then Bane's plan to destroy Gotham is in full gear. And he intends to do so with a Wayne enterprises reactor-turned nuclear bomb no less. By now Batman has hooked up with a young detective who knows about Wayne's past. The lame commissioner is also back. And they all aim to stop Bane's masterplan. This time around at least Batman gets to fly around in some plane-thing.

This too is then a convoluted long movie with a lot going on. What interested me the most was the Catgirl angle and Ra's al Ghul's legacy and family tree. The mythology isn't emphasized enough in these movies. Why Nolan's Batman movies are so devoid of Batman I don't get but here we have strong and interesting alternate characters in Catgirl and detective Blake. The problem with our main villain Bane is that he wears a mouthmask making him hard to understand, which makes his villain-speeches far less powerful. Of course he's not the only villain as there is no shortage of bad guys/gals. And a single and mostly absent good guy can't make up for it."
"Regardless of the chaos surrounding this movie and the tragedy... TDKR is probably one of the greatest films of all time. I don't want to say too much to give anything away cause this movie does not deserve to be spoiled (Unlike David Letterman tried to do. Clever man but you didn't foil it thank god)

I say don't let this tragedy scare you away from viewing this in your local theater or IMAX...if you fail to go out, this heart less gunman wins... I will not let him scare me away from what I want to do... I will go out and see this movie multiple times.

It is amazing and without a doubt it is a must see film. Bravo Nolan for putting together an amazing cast, and crafting together such a masterful trilogy of my most beloved comic book hero"
"Although I'm not an invested DC fan/Batman fan, I'm an invested film fan. I thought personally on my first watch, it didn't live up to my expectation.

The first half felt slow and didn't grab my interest, although Tom Hardy as Bane seemed an exciting addition in theory, I found the muffled yet obviously altered volume of his voice a little too distracting in places. Ultimately, this villain didn't have me too scared, he lacked in character development, but made up some of this through Hardy's performance.

The second half of DKR was a lot more entertaining and watchable for me. Much more exciting plot and excellent conclusion. Maybe a second watch through may change my mind - but on first impressions.... don't believe the hype completely."
"Christopher Nolan is the best and most visionary director in todays directors, and ""the Dark Knight rises"" proves it. Bale did an awesome job once again as Batman, Bane was terrifying but awesome villain. And the rest of cast were just right on! I thought that Levitt did an amazing job by joining in the cast and his character will portray key points for the future, if there is one. I just wish that Nolan will continue with the future of Batman! The Dark Knight Rises was full of emotion, power and Oscar worthy cinema!! Its worth seeing in the theaters and its the best of the series, Nolan keeps on the top of each release of this series, Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and now The Dark Knight Rises. Please Mr. Nolan please come back and continue on with Batman, you have brought Batman to a vision of respect, emotion and a full blast of excitement and epic!."
"So Today I watched the Dark Knight Rises(Most Probably the most awaited move of 2012) 1st day 1st show and i was simply starstruck. Here is how I thought it was: Dark, Brilliantly Put Together due to a mixture of excellent acting by the cast and direction by the Brilliant Christopher Nolan and Highly Entertaining throughout the movie, The Dark Knight Rises probably lives up to its huge expectations and it ensures that the Batman series fan enjoy this movie as much as any other Batman movies due to the sheer brilliant work by Chris Nolan and his acting crew and also his other technical staff which make this for me the best summer movie of this year.

The Acting by the whole crew to be honest is brilliantly done by each and every member of the crew regard-less of how big/small his or her role is. Christian Bale as Batman was classic as always and he has perfected this role of Batman and this is probably his best performance as Batman in this franchise and he suited well with his fellow actors in this movie and gave a great performance! Anne Hathaway as Catwoman was actually quite brilliant and she has done an excellent job as the cunning Selina Kyle who is always looking to do mischivious things and she has a significant role in the movie which she plays very well. The Trio of Gary Oldman, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Marion Cotillard had small roles in comparison to the earlier two, but their roles were important and Oldman was class as always and Joseph always does excellent things with Nolan and the same saying goes for Marion who is excellent as Miranda Tate. Michael Caine has perfected the role of Alfred(Batman's butler) to perfection and his performance in this movie is amazing as always! Last But not the least, I simply loved the Performance of Tom Hardy as the menacing villain known as Bane! His voice was quite different and scary and his acting is top class as always and he really gives the audience the feeling that he is a dangerous villain for Batman and Tom has really impressed me with this performance.

The Direction by Chris Nolan in this movie is just sheer brilliance by the man who is proving to be the best director of his generation with every movie he makes, and with the pressure of The Dark Knight, he does not disappoint Batman fans with this master-piece which will ensure all that is needed for a Great movie such as the excellent Acting, the beautiful and superb cinematography and also the perfect music by Hans Zimmer and Nolan puts all these things perfectly into place to make another master-piece to his cabinet of classic movies. Hats off to this great man, he is improving with each and every movie and deserves an Oscar sooner rather than later.

The Story of this film was written by Chris Nolan and David S. Goyer and the screen-play which is written by Chris and Jonathan Nolan, is now 8 years after the menacing Joker terrorized Gotham City and after Batman was accused for Killing Harvey Dent, Gotham is now terrorized by the evil Terrorist Bane who is looking to destroy the city along with his army of men and Batman must stop the menacing Bane from destroying Gotham along with putting his own personal fears aside him. Bane is a very cunning and intelligent villain who is both Brawny and Brainy and he becomes a terror for Batman who comes to Gotham City's aid after 8 years, but he also has to deal with the Catwoman in his journey to stop Bane from destroying Gotham. The Story at times was a bit predictable but nonetheless it was a story with twists and turns and ensures total entertainment and drama for the audience.

The Cinematography in this movie is absolutely breath-taking at times and the Gotham City shown in this movie is a work of brilliant camera-work and also the other places shown in the movie are breath-taking and its better in the giant screen of the movie hall. Hats of to Cinematographer Wally Pfister for his contribution in the film! The Visual Effects of the movie are also sublime as the visually enthralling scenes shown in the movie are so good specially when Batman shows of his cool gadgets. The Other aspects of the film such as Art Direction, Costume design are also very well done to make this into a quite perfect super-hero movie! The Music by Hans Zimmer is absolutely sublime from the start to the end of the movie, Zimmer synchronises the music perfectly along with each scene of the movie and is a really talented Music Director and he also done brilliant once again with Chris Nolan and again his brilliant music is shown in such a brilliant movie. Hats of to Zimmer, he is really a very very talented Music Director.

I Absolutely loved this movie from start to end, it had everything a great super-hero film needs, although it may be a bit dark and serious, a bit of comedy in times just keeps the balance of the film in check and I would recommend everyone to watch this amazing movie which is full of entertainment and twists at crucial times and I can assure all Batman fans that you wont be dis-appointed by this! My Rating: 9/10"
"After eight years in seclusion, Batman resurfaces to face Bane, a mastermind bent on destroying Gotham and has ties to Bruce Wayne's past. Christopher Nolan's conclusion to his Dark Knight trilogy should be treated as a wrap up rather than a third installment. Despite many new characters being introduced, even their conflicts and motives are derived from events that occurred in the previous two films. Such an approach could be seen as a weakness, since the conflict could just end up being sort of a rematch rather than moving the story forward; however, Nolan's approach works terrificly. Over an hour is shot in stunning IMAX, but the film is more touching than it is intense and that's its best quality. Hardy steps in as the genius mercenary Bane, who is slightly bigger, slightly stronger and slightly smarter than Batman, thus making him a challenge best suited for the grand finale. The Joker works best as Batman's arch-nemesis since they are polar opposites, with The Joker standing for everything Batman stands against. Two-Face works best as Batman's most tragic enemy because Harvey Dent is very much like Bruce Wayne the only difference is: Dent copes with his tragedy through revenge rather than seeking justice as Wayne did. Bane works best as Batman's most challenging villain because of his physical and mental superiority—forget the Bane you saw in ""BATMAN & ROBIN"". Nolan carefully chose all his villains in the series wisely and executed them perfectly. Hardy had big shoes to fill following Ledger's posthumous Oscar winning performance; while Bane is no Joker, Hardy does a satisfying job and should not be compared to Ledger's performance as they are completely different roles. It is Michael Caine, however, that delivers the most memorable and touching performance of the entire film. A wonderful conclusion to a wonderful trilogy.

**** (out of four)"
"The Dark Knight Rises was a perfect sequel to a masterpiece. Christopher Nolan took a different direction and focused more on Bruce Wayne/Batman. This movie is filled with lots of emotions. It has such great characters and of course the dialogs is so good. The performances are incredible. It was my most anticipated movie of the century. The more I watch it, The more epic it gets. Personally, I think The Dark Knight Trilogy is the greatest Trilogy of all time and this movie gives the greatest ending of all time in the movie history. I remember seeing it thrice and the more I watched It the more respect it earns. Thank you Christopher Nolan, You Sir Are A Master."
"Possibly my personal favourite of the Nolan Batman films, and I do like Batman Begins and The Dark Knight very much. Is it perfect? For me, not quite, there are so many plot strand in a long running time that the film occasionally(and there is a big emphasis on that) sags in momentum and some of the strands in the ending could have done with more development. It is a brilliant film all the same, one of the highlights so far of the year. As to expect from Christopher Nolan, it is a visually audacious film, with gorgeous cinematography, a beautifully realised Gotham City and great special effects. Hans Zimmer's score is not one of his very best for me, but there is still an epic and haunting quality that is just perfect for this film. The dialogue provokes thought and makes an emotional impact, and a vast majority of the time The Dark Knight Rises is ambitious and gripping. I don't consider Christopher Nolan one of my favourites, this said he is a hugely impressive director who shows great ambition and a willingness to make his subject matters interesting. He does a really wonderful job here, as the set/action pieces including the plane hijack and Bane's assault on Gotham are enough to make the jaw drop. The performances are just terrific from all involved, Matthew Modine fares weakest but he is far from bad. Christian Bale is still a charismatic presence, Matthew Caine appropriately loyal and Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman subtly understated. Joseph Gordon Levitt captures his character's idealism wonderfully. Tom Hardy is in beefed-up terrifying mode as Bane, a worthy successor to Heath Ledger's iconic Joker. Anne Hathaway was a curious casting choice, but as Catwoman she is spot on, here is a Catwoman who actually does much more than acting sexy(which she still is), she is very ruthless and no-nonsense here. All in all, a hugely impressive film, the best of Nolan's Batman trilogy- though I'm prepared for any flaming I'll get for this opinion- and one of the highlights so far of 2012. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"There's a storm coming .....

Years after being villified, Batman is encouraged once again to come Gotham's aid, as it's in the grip of a group of mercenaries run by the villainous Bane.

First of all, you don't have to be a superhero fan to enjoy this great movie, it truly does have the most broad appeal, there's something here for everyone to enjoy. If you liked the two preceding films, I figure you'll love this one, I'm a fan of all three, this is my personal favourite.

It's a long movie, but it flies by at a canter, no single frame is wasted, it moves by at a terrific pace, it has incredible action sequences, but the story is terrific.

It's really interesting to see Batman coming in from a position where he's decided and feared, he's no longer accepted as Gotham's hero and saviour.

Christian Bale is the perfect Batman, and he is matched every step of the way by Tom Hardy. Hardy is off the charts as Bane, the last time we saw the character was back in The Batman and Robin film, perhaps best forgotten, here though he's an iconic villain.

I can't speak highly enough of Bale and Hardy, but this is also, I think the best of Anne Hathaway, she is excellent here.

A decade on, and this film is still fabulous.

10/10."
"Christopher Nolan's epic trilogy concludes in glorious fashion and gives us a thought provoking and suitably satisfying conclusion to an epic saga. It's emotional, intense and has a great villain in Tom Hardy."
"Not being a huge fan of superhero movies, I didn't have much expectations for Batman Begins. However viewing the 2005 Christopher Nolan production, I was pleasantly shocked. Then after my huge expectations for, ""The Dark Knight"", Christopher Nolan blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, ""The Dark Knight Rises""? Quite simply, Yes! My big expectations were once again, blown away. What a production! This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The editing, sound, score, visuals, direction and action are all top notch.

The film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Christian Bale, of course still makes is a great Batman. Michael Cain is fantastic, as he always is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be considered for an Oscar nomination. Tom Hardy as Bane is utterly terrifying, at times, and completely ominous. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman/Selina Kyle is a scene stealer. She is completely engrossing. Everyone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors are so well done, so well written, and so well directed. The Dark Knight Rises is is emotionally riveting and amazing to view.

At a running time of almost 3 hours, the film never becomes dull, which is pretty impressive. The movie's action sequences are spectacularly well created and very intense. The dialogue between the character's are intelligent and highly believable. The movie's soundtrack is terrific and really exemplify's many of the movie's scenes. Extremely well editing and sound use really develop many of the movie's action scenes, so it's not just explosions and visuals like in many other movies. Nolan creates a grand, dirty, engrossing world, and his action sequences just hum.

In conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that great writing and direction can enhance any movie-going experience, even superhero movies, which are usually thought of as mindless entertainment. I am wholly satisfied with Christopher Nolan's vision and thank all who worked on this film for bringing such an intricate interpretation of its very famous literary source. I cannot recommend this film anymore than I have, I just have to say everyone and anyone should see it. 10/10"""
"I think as a film stand point, the dark knight is a better movie that is better acted and tense the whole way through. The dark knight rises to me is a more fun and action filled movie that you can sit back a bit more. The acting is still amazing and combined with the atmosphere/visuals of the movie creates a the sense of realism that the movie has. That realism is where the intensity stems from throughout the movie, the audience believing that something like this could actually happen makes it that much scarier. Bane is also an excellent villain, in the dark knight the joker challenges Batman mentally but Bane physically challenges him which is a completely new challenge for Batman. The plot is incredible, it it starts fast and instantly brings you into the action. It then takes a step back to develop the characters further and build up the challenge Batman has to face. Once one of the many challenges was overcome by Batman in launches the viewer straight back into action for one epic final battle that lasts almost an hour......and it is GLORIOUS! Not one second was I bored, it is truly incredible how each movie in the trilogy is this good, it shouldn't be possible. I've not even mentioned the incredible soundtrack to compliment the astounding yet grounded action. I can't compliment this movie enough. If you haven't someone seen this trilogy yet....watch it, you won't be disappointed."
"I came out with slight disappointment after watching DKR for I had huge expectations from Nolan after an exceptional TDK.

I am huge fan of first two installment of Batman Trilogy. I liked DKR, it's a good movie, but it could have been much better.

So rather than discussing its merit, which are many, I am pointing out its shortcomings.

It's the weaker than other movies of trilogy and simple reason being it lacks strong characters. DKR is all about storytelling, just like Nolan's Inception, but not as efficient. And in doing so, it fails where Batman Begins and The Dark Knight had succeeded.

Batman Begins was all about fear, doubt, self-realization and redemption where Bruce Wayne discovers his destiny as Batman. BB had a story arc which set background for main characters - Batman / Wayne, Ra's al Ghul, Gordon (to some extent) and most importantly Gothom City and hence set stage for a fitting climax.

The Dark Knight explores the theme of chaos, morality and belief effortlessly and establishes characters of Joker, Harvey Dent/Two Face, Rachel etc. So effortlessly that people choose to ignore even some major plot holes. Heath Ledger's interpretation of Joker was so mesmerizing that it single handily carried TDK to path of greatness/ critical acclaim.

But Dark Knight Rises is all about story telling - efficient but not exceptional. Bane, Miranda Tate, John Blake, Peter Folly (Deputy Commissioner), Selina Kyle - characters are introduced but never explored/ expanded - they just start working on their part - just like cogs in the wheel. They are not so much part of the story itself but just the agents which move the story forward.

Bane's character is dull and single dimensional and do not evoke any fear or awe. He's meticulous, intelligent and strong and this is established quickly in movie but after that he slumps into a just another movie villain. Taila / Miranda character is never fully explored. Even Wayne/Batman is devoid of any emotions in this one and he feels so sure of himself that I start wondering if it's the same Batman that I saw in first two installments. Only new character which had some shades was that of Selina Kyle and Anne Hathaway did justice to it. Add to that helplessness of Alfred portrayed superbly by Caine. Other actors are good but there's not much for them to do.

There's no dilemma, choices, moral battles, hope, chaos or fear - things that make characters and plot interesting and which made Batman Begins and The Dark Knight really good movies. Even the theme of ""Occupy WallStreet"" is very weak and, at best, is closer to London riots with its looting and arson. There's even perfect order in Bane's revolution. Movie moves effortlessly from one plot to another and to climax that it become at times predictable.

But maybe Dark Knight Rises was supposed to be like that only and Nolan had too much to deal with in 2.5 hours. And maybe that's the main problem with DKR - too much is going on in the story that it seems crammed at times. And when there are too many characters and so many story arcs, it's tough to do justice to characters and story telling at the same time.

Dark Knight Rises have a good story but lacks strong characters and relies on Inception's style which incidentally differs from style of first two installments of Batman Trilogy.

And for me, soul of Nolan's Batman Series is its strong characters, their underlying emotions and a theme which is much deeper and meaningful than all fight, gadgetry and style. And this is where DKR fails.

6/10."
"Christopher Nolan has outdone himself with this one. At 3.30 in the morning, I was tired. Just getting out of it, I've never been so awake.

Perhaps what set this film apart from his other films was that it had a genuine emotional heartbeat. I felt that this was a flaw of Nolan's other films - the vision of emotion was there, but it was hollow. In this I bought it. I felt it, hero and villain alike.

Christian Bale was typically brilliant as Batman, and I felt that Bruce Wayne was more heavily embraced in this final installment. Bale added emotional depth to the character - a plot point that I think went astray in The Dark Knight - picking up from the development made in Batman Begins.

Tom Hardy as Bane was quite simply, terrifying. No longer a dunderhead ""enforcer"", but one of the criminal masterminds behind ""Gotham's Reckoning"", coupled with a physical dominance strong enough to send shivers down your spine.

Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle defied my expectations. Hands up who was not entirely convinced that that girl from the Princess Diaries could handle an intensely physical role like Catwoman. But here I am, hugely impressed. She added immeasurably to the value of the film.

Marion Cotillard fulfilled the role of Miranda Tate admirably, though I suspect this was the most underdeveloped character of the film - though after watching, I can see why.

The unsung hero of The Dark Knight Rises is Michael Caine as Alfred. A heartfelt performance that helps drive the emotional content of the film, helping Nolan sell his most well-rounded film to date. Caine's performance in both presence and absence.

Special mention goes to Joseph Gordon Levitt, who is consistently proving himself to be a big player in the Hollywood game. His role as officer Blake felt like there could've been more, but it may just have come all a bit much. It was a great performance, and Levitt sunk his teeth into role.

If you can, go see this in IMAX. If any film was to sell the format to skeptics, The Dark Knight Rises would be IT. I'm happy Nolan stuck to his guns and shot in 2D. 3D would have been unnecessary.

I suppose at this point, I have to turn my focus on Nolan. If he ever reads this... aspiring filmmaker to filmmaker, I've never been so envious, jealous in all my life. It's a film that leaves me floundering, wondering what I could possibly do to get anywhere near this ballpark. Well done. I think an Oscar Nomination is in order.

From here, I'm not sure what to expect of the future. Does our imagination carry us forward, or do the studios? Time will tell.

"I had the honor of watching TDKR during a screening and was completely blown away! Christopher Nolan's third film in his Batman trilogy doesn't disappoint. The movie is incredibly well made, its huge production is quite breathtaking to view. This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The movie's score high-lites many of its incredible scenes, and at times, it takes your breath away.

The film featured excellent performances, by all the cast. Christian Bale, as always is great as Batman. Anne Hathaway was completely engrossing, she became ""Catwoman"", just like Michele Pfeiffer did, although their interpretations were very different, both were equally effective. Tom Hardy was the main villain ""Bane"" completely shattered my expectations. One of the best superhero movie villains, I've ever seen. The terror caused by him, is completely believable and quite menacing. Marlion Cotilliard, Michael Cane, Gary Oldman, and others all did well in their respective roles. Now I know most will miss Heath Ledger as the Joker.(I know I do) I hope people don't compare Tom Hardy's performance to Heath Ledger's, its completely unfair and the two characters are very different. Just read the comics.

The colossal size of the film is a spectacle to behold, but surprisingly you don't get lost with all the explosions and extravagant action scenes, like in other films,(AKA Transformers, or POTC.) If one were to gripe, and I suppose there will never be a film made that one cannot find a point at which to grip, it is painfully long running time here. I found myself more worried about the pain in my posterior than the emotional final minutes after almost 3 hours that I had spent in a cramped seat, but that's just how I am. However the ending is just fantastic, so emotional and bring the trilogy to a very satisfying end.

Sorry if I'm being all fan-boyish and kissing this movie's behind, but I really admire it. It may not be among my personal favorites but generally this seems to be the movie event of this year. As a film though, this is amazing. A true lasting legacy in superhero story telling and summer-blockbusters."
"The best thing about this movie is how satisfying it is. It doesn't leave you frustrated or confused. You can't really complain that it didn't explore certain ideas or follow through. By deciding to have an official ending to this trilogy's story, the themes surrounding Batman are very fresh. We don't know where he'll end up. It's not the same old thing about whether he can continue to be Batman or not, which was already getting repetitive in Spider-man 2. The conclusions are not as important as the feelings they invoke as they come about. Nolan is especially good at capturing the complete tension of actually not knowing what will happen and deeply questioning what you *want* to happen and why.

This movie is bigger than the previous two, far more ambitious. There are no obvious annoying weaknesses that usually come with films in general, especially blockbuster action movies. All of Nolan's movies have deep psychological themes and this takes those in another new direction. I thought Inception was hugely original and insightful about the way people think. That level of abstraction and depth is present in this film. Bane bursts into it, his reputation is quickly established. Nolan uses people's expectations and anticipation to the fullest. We are left to wonder about what has happened in the 8 years since the events of The Dark Knight. Why have the characters become the way they are now?

In the latter half, it does seem like the movie is trying to pull off so many different plot points and connections, but they all work. The cast is very large and impressive. You don't see ""good acting"". You see fascinating characters. They're just playing their part in the grand story that's being crafted. There are many unfamiliar faces but they all have a strange, unique look to them. We often see a person's flaws and previous decisions coming back to haunt them. They find out the hard way what mistakes they have made. Where their limits are. Where they lose control.

The score is almost tribal, very raw and energetic. You don't get much chance to pay attention to it but many parts of the movie are pounding with excitement. There are countless quotable lines and disturbing slices of dialogue. They cut deep. The Joker was a great character and this is a very different movie but the themes are just as dark, only perhaps indirectly. Underneath, it's very sinister. Writing and efficiency appear to be among Nolan's greatest strengths. The story has many layers that interweave and apparently they came in under budget.

Perhaps the most important thing about Catwoman is that she's completely believable. When she beats up men, you don't roll your eyes. She's feminine and powerful in her own way. She fits into the world and we completely understand her motivations. She doesn't have a huge role but a very important one.

I didn't find myself moved but maybe I'm too cynical. I was more affected psychologically. Curious about humanity and all the different sides of it you see in this movie. It goes to many extremes. I felt humbled by my complete lack of life experience. What do I know about anything? How could I possibly understand half of the characters? I haven't been through anything or achieved anything compared to most of them. Michael Caine gets a bigger role this time. He was always critical but this time he's very much the emotional core.

I thought Christian Bale was overlooked in The Dark Knight especially. The movies hinge on him. Bruce Wayne's just a man but also incredibly inspirational. Bale's famous for completely committing to his roles and it pays off. Tom Hardy is impressive as Bane but I suppose that's no surprise. The rest of the leads are similarly awesome. There are many references to the earlier films. Very few questions are left unanswered. It's always nice when film-makers really think it through and make an actual decision and get all the details right.

So anyway, I'll miss Batman (since the trilogy has ended) but couldn't have hoped for a better, more epic and sincere finale to his story."
"The Batman series by Christopher Nolan was and is probably one of the best superhero series ever. In an industry where very few sequels have been that good, The Dark Knight, I believe was designed by Christopher Nolan to be head and shoulders above Batman Begins; and it was. The Dark Knight surpassed Batman Begins, end of story. Now that you have accomplished what very few have managed, how do you surpass this one. A daunting and mountainous task indeed. Only now, Nolan wasn't even trying to surpass it. He was merely trying to present a movie that would build on its predecessor.

The movie is set 8 years after the Joker incident so that anything related to the Joker need not be shown (RIP Heath Ledger). Nolan presents us a completely different Gotham. A different take on it. And how 8 years can change people. How the harvey dent and joker incident can affect people and batman himself. In a time of peace, it is quite easy to plan and attack even an entire city. Everything is taken into concern. And it all adds up to one seemingly invincible villain. The logic is never lost at any point of time. The screenplay is penned to allow the impact of what has happened to Gotham and its people in ""The Dark Knight"" and what could happen if something goes wrong now.

All things said, if you are expecting something better than The Dark Knight, you are mistaken. This was never going to compete or surpass that. This is a very good movie in its own right. As for the series, there cannot be a better conclusion and I really hope nobody else continues this series if Nolan decides not to.

TDKR needs to be appreciated for staying true to its roots and still giving us something good, exhilarating and unexpected."
"There are plenty of elements that made this film work, so I suppose we can tick them off one by one. For starters, the continuation on the focus of Bruce Wayne's story, which has made it all tick. This version of Bruce Wayne and Alfred become the familiar characters we're accustomed with since 2005, and the film invests heavily on the emotional bonding between the two, which deals back to the theme about fear that rears its ugly head again, and how a father figure cannot stand idly by to watch the one he brought up recklessly charge into battle after a long hiatus, and hoping for a life of normalcy with the mantle of the bat given up. Michael Caine may have a shorter screen time than before, but no less powerful.

When Sam Raimi had to put the popular and powerful Venom into Spider-man 3 pretty much against his wishes, we all knew how that turned out to be, effectively killing off the franchise until the decision to reboot it. There may be some similar fears with the introduction of a fairly contemporary villain in Bane, but the story gave him more purpose and meaning, and Tom Hardy was excellent par none in this role as the compete villain - with plenty of brawn, merciless, masterful, and with a plan any terrorist would be proud of. If the Scarecrow meant to induce fear, and the Joker to create chaos, Bane is carnage incarnate. Tom Hardy, even being the requisite mask, is fearful, and while the designs of his plan may dwarf the Joker's in complexity, it sure rivaled his in terms of delivery, and execution. Anyone in his path gets shoved aside with deadly consequences, and anyone alive is only because there is of further use. No hesitation, and no compromise.

And Nolan continues with the introduction of a lot more villains big and small, behind a mask or otherwise, in his Bat films than anyone would credit him for, especially when having those whose lines are blurred, or corrupt to the core and hiding behind social status and fortune. This in turn provides for another arc that boils underneath the main narrative, where the rich and powerful continue to enjoy their successes at the expense of the have-nots, and the Occupy Movement in a way being a very real parallel to the proceedings on screen. While the mobsters were clearly at the top of the food chain in the earlier Nolan films, this one shifted focus to politicians and the elite community, with their fair share of scandals and corporate greed.

While Bane was to the point, Selina Kyle played by Anne Hathaway, is both sensual and a force to be reckoned with herself, being like how she's best portrayed, on the fence. There's a bit of Frank Miller's Year One in this one given the presence of Juno Temple's Holly, and the back to basics as a jewel thief, compared to the mousy secretary in Tim Burton's Batman Returns with Michelle Pfeiffer defining the role, and the garbage that was Halle Berry's. Anne Hathaway nailed this one with what would be a truly memorable outing, and as if a homage of sorts to Burton's second Batman film, that the repartee between Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle at a party became one of the highlights here, as does her thievery and combat ability. She may lack her whip, but more than makes up for it with her steel stiletto heels, and the very sensual and sleekly designed feline moves that you'd wonder how they got delivered while wrapped under that skin tight suit.

And not only is the technology put on screen fictionally impressive, the technical aspects behind the scenes also worked wonders, chalking up serious mileage in having more than an hour's worth of footage shot on the IMAX format. Wally Pfister's cinematography continues to impress with that staying consistent to the gritty look and feel developed for all the Bat films to date, before his departure into a film director's role for his next project. Hans Zimmer also probably developed the best score for Nolan's Bat films, and I dare say without which this film would be less stellar, with the score playing a huge role in adding plenty of character and emotion to the film, lifting it up with excitement during the many set action pieces, with recognizable themes assigned to major players, heightening dangers, and providing a boost to the many feelings in this one heck of an action-adventure.

With how things developed at the end, and what I felt was initial horror of sorts with Batman out in broad daylight, secret identity being porous and all, this film ended in what would be the best way possible - with possibilities, and a twinkle of an eye, Inception style with a did it, or did it not. Twists, turns, surprises and sleight of hand, making it a clear favourite as one of the best this year. Do yourself a favour and watch it in the IMAX format, just as it was intended.

Because you have just got to believe in Christopher Nolan, and the kind of films he has so far delivered. Take a bow, bat-crew, for a trilogy that has now set the bar for any comic book film, and especially any other follow Batman movie, reboot or otherwise, to live up to."
"I'm going to start off by saying that this was probably one of my most anticipated movies of all time. I went in the theater hoping for a masterpiece. I actually expected this movie to jump into my top five of all time. It didn't disappoint, I loved it.

The opening scene had me questioning what exactly was going on. Movies that make you think about the smallest details of the plot are my favorite. In the scene the audience is introduced to the new villain, Bane. As a kid watching cartoons I always thought that bane was a mindless hulk-like bad guy. In this movie he has a true to the comic's portrayal. He's smart, he has a plan, and he'll stop at nothing to put it into action. Much like Dark Knight, the Villain is a major standout. He has such an intimidating presence on screen. Tom Hardy put so much work into the physicality of the character. The first fight between Bane and Batman is one of the moments that they had to get right. Luckily it's one of my favorite moments in the entire film! In the scene they don't use too much sound, just Bane's taunts as he fights, truly frightening. His voice is so interesting. It's something you'll really remember about the film. After the film my friends and I couldn't help but do Bane impressions. He has so many quotable lines that he will probably be one of my favorite villains of all time. You might be wondering if he outperformed the Joker from Dark Knight. The answer is no, not quite. He's so different of a character it's hard to compare, but Joker was just too hard to beat. Christian Bale's performance as Batman and Bruce Wayne was amazing. This was easily his best performance as Batman. The story takes place eight years after the end of Dark Knight so Bruce is feeling the ill effects of being batman. He uses a cane now, and he has a little grey hair. This is a story about Bruce Wayne coming back, and doing anything he can for his city. Bruce and Alfred have some amazing scenes where you forget your watching acting. The emotion they both convey when they're together is stunning. Michel Cane doesn't have as much screen time as he does in the other movies, but he's so good in the ones he's in you won't forget his performance. Morgan Freeman is back. He has some particularly funny scenes with Bruce. They feel like old friends yet again. You really can't go wrong with any of the actors in this movie. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays young police officer Blake. He has some great character development during the course of the movie. I was cheering for him the whole time. If you come out of this movie saying ""I just wish it had better acting"" I'd question your sanity. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman was one big worry I had about the movie going in. Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised. She did a great job of portraying the playful vigilante. She actually had okay chemistry with Christian Bale. Catwoman wasn't forced into the story, her character made sense within the plot. She didn't ruin the movie, which was all I was asking for. Plus, she actually looked like she could fight. She wasn't doing the ""I'm a woman who can beat up ten men with one hand tied behind my back"" routine. It was such a relief that they didn't try to do something annoying like Black Widow from Avengers.

The story was fantastic. It's amazing that Christopher Nolan wasn't planning on doing this movie before he made Batman Begins. There are so many callbacks and references to that movie I would strongly recommend watching that one again before you see this one. I kept saying ""Oh I remember when he said that!"" or thinking ""That ties in perfectly"". This one had plenty of twists and turns. Multiple times I was questioning what was true and what was a clever ruse. If there are any negatives, you might say there are some plot leaps. Not holes mind you, but something upon thinking about it you might consider a little unbelievable. With such huge story and scope I'm surprised there aren't more mistakes. The scale of this movie is far bigger than in either of the first two Batman movies. Bane has a plan for all of Gotham and batman has to stop an entire city of villains. The entire trilogy comes to a very fitting finish. I absolutely loved the ending. I was very satisfied how everything tied together. I especially loved the conclusion of Bruce's story, perfect. When I came out of the theater I couldn't wait to discuss the amazing things that happened in the end. This is a movie where the more you watch it the more you'll understand and enjoy it.

Of course, in the conclusion to a trilogy like this one you would expect to be dazzled by the special effects. They were quite impressive. The new batwing has some pretty amazing aerial maneuvers. You definitely get your money's worth with the cinematography. The opening and ending scenes especially stand out. There was an extremely cool Bat Pod driving scene that, as soon as it was over, I wanted to watch it again.

It can't tell you enough that this was an amazing movie. It was certainly the best of the year. If you're wondering if it's better than The Dark Knight I honestly can't say. Time will tell. It could be better, and that's some of the highest praise I can give it.

Edit: Time did tell. It didn't hold up. Still good. Nowhere near Dark Knight tkubas1.wordpress.com."
"'The Dark Knight Rises' is the third and final instalment in Christopher Nolan's groundbreaking trilogy that reshaped the superhero genre as we know it. The main cast return as well as some newcomers. Tom Hardy as 'Bane', Anne Hathaway as 'Selina', Joseph Gordon-Levitt as 'Blake' and Marion Cotillard as 'Miranda'. The new additions are fantastic, especially Tom Hardy. He brings a menacing presence to the character and finally incorporates the main part of his comic counterpart, his brains. For sure Bane is incredibly strong, but he is also an unbelievable strategist that can systematically wear down Batman whilst also using his strength to defeat him. Hardy displays all of this perfectly despite us barely seeing his face, the mask he wears makes him more frightening and is used as an interesting plot device later in the film. A lot of people criticised the voice that Hardy uses for this character, but personally I love it, I think adds to the mystery of the figure. The best acting comes from Michael Caine as 'Alfred Pennyworth'. Nolan really fleshes out Alfred and Bruce's relationship in this film and Caine plays the reluctant mentor figure perfectly. One of his final scenes really shows off his acting, the regret that Alfred pours out and it's heartbreaking. Whilst all of the other actors are great, Caine excels in this movie compared to 'Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight'. The writing is brilliant, so many twists and turns and a sensational ending that really brings the trilogy full circle and has a great ending to Bruce's arc. The dialogue is excellent, in particular the many Bane monologues that add another layer onto his great character. The fight choreography improves massively and is loads better than the last two films. Hanz Zimmers score is superb and works in all scenes that it features in. Also, the cinematography is beautiful, Wally Pfister, who has worked with Nolan throughout the trilogy, really peaks in this picture. However, this movie isn't perfect, Bane's final demise is very underwhelming, especially for a character that makes as much of an impact as he does. Finally the twist at the end with Blake feels tacked on and is inaccurate to the source material. Overall, I love this movie, for sure it doesn't live up to the heights of 'The Dark Knight' but it is still exceptional and was a stunning way to end this unbelievable series of films.

"Let me start by saying, that I am an avid Nolan admirer. Up until now I haven't seen a bad Nolan film. All of his movies would be in my top movies list if I had one, I consider him a genius. After seeing the final act of his Batman I have started to reconsider.

The movie was filled with moments where I found myself thinking ""This is not believable"" and after the first hour I asked myself ""Is this it?"". Gladly after the first hour things did become more meaningful. The ""fall"" of the dark knight was awesome, Bane was a tough guy and the Batman did suffer. It was great. Even Anne Hathaway came trough crushing all my negative preconceptions. Other than that, the movie certainly didn't deliver.

In the end they ruined Banes character. Batman's training in this film was far from believable. There were lot of little stories and story structures going on, which didn't work when added together. I mean they worked but comparing to the previous films of Nolan they certainly did not deliver. In many scenes I thought ""This is something that just could not happen"", the things in this film just didn't work. And I don't mean Batman doing his stunts, of course they are unrealistic, I mean all the little things that left me bothered.

On the other hand when it comes to Batman's stunts there were little, the end conclusion left me thinking ""was this the great finale of BATMAN?"". Isn't Batman supposed to do something cooler than fly a plane or ride a motorcycle? Isn't Batman supposed to be an acrobat who beats everyone in a cool, cunning and mysterious ways? Here he was the operator of an army plane. In the previous films he was Batman, in this film he doesn't really come off as Batman. His only a random commando wearing a Batman suit. This is something I could not forgive Nolan for.

If the scenes we're actually believable I would've propably considered forgiving him this error, but these two errors together are just too much for me to say this is an impressive movie. You might be able to go as far to say this is good, but it is not impressive. This is a shame, because the guy who did this has done nothing but impressive movies. For some other director this movie could be a good stepping stone for something better, an acceptable movie that did have its moments, but for Nolan it is an utter failure. There we're times in this movie when he got me and I was impressed. The movie did in certain scenes raise my emotion and hit me where it should've, but as a whole taking into account all the bad things it cannot be regarded as a movie above others.

I was let down with this movie. With all of his previous movies that I have seen in the theathre I have gone in with enormous expectations, like the kind of hyped mind you should never walk in with and every single time I have walked out with my expectations blown away by the grandness of what I have just seen. This time I walked in with the same expectations and came out disappointed. The only question in my mind being ""How was he able to not see these flaws in this movie, I thought he was a genius who could not fail""."
"This movie shows that despite failure, despite your fears, despite your enemies, you can be a hero. you can use all three of those things to your advantage and become something better than you were before you encountered them. it masterfully shows and tells that ANYONE can be a hero.

obviously on a technical level this film is perfect. almost the entirety of the third act is shot in beautiful imax, that's sadly only in 16:9 on 4K. just like with the previous transfers, sound and picture are great, but this is probably the best looking film to me.

it may not seem like it at first, but just like ra's and joker, bane is the opposite side of the same coin for batman. tom hardy perfectly embodies bane and the darkness, and obviously he's a downgrade from joker, but that doesn't mean he's not the perfect villain for a finale.

hans zimmer delivers probably my third favorite score from him, with an incredible theme for bane as well as many extensions of previous themes.

this is such an underrated finale. all three films mesh together so well, they feel like one. they mean so much to me, and i'll forever thank nolan for making these films."
"I've always loved superhero movies and as a kid Batman was my favourite superhero and I collected as many of the comic books as I could possibly afford.

Saying that I've never expected a superhero movie to be between the best genres of movies that I would ever watch. I just expect them to be entertaining and something fun to watch. I watch most of them; Superman, Spiderman, Ironman, X-men etc.

I expected the same this time but I was knocked off my feet. The actors, the storyline, the manuscript and the filming just came together as one of the best movies I've ever seen. This movie has really brilliant and powerful dialogues.

If you haven't seen it yet then I can strongly recommend it. I will definitely see it again with a good bottle of wine and popcorn. Enjoy!"
"Christopher Nolan's stunning conclusion to his Batman trilogy is a welcome return to form after the slightly overrated THE DARK KNIGHT, which was so obsessed with being all dark and brooding that it forgot to tell much of a story. Despite the presence of a much-hyped (and lamented) Heath Ledger in the cast, I found that film to be less entertaining than BATMAN BEGINS although it still remains an engaging and watchable film. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES (horrible title, by the way), though, blows it out of the water, offering a piece of sheer spectacle that's as involving and as tightly-plotted as you could wish for.

It's eight years since the last film, and Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne is nowadays retired and definitely feeling his age. Before long, though, a hulking brute of a bad guy (Tom Hardy, whose sheer physicality in the role will surprise nobody who's seen Bronson) decides to do some very unpleasant things in the city, so it's time to dust off the bat suit and get back into the action. Good news for the viewer.

As usual, Nolan surpasses the conventions of his genre, making this a superhero film that looks nothing like a superhero film, instead more like a modern-day epic of dramatic cinema. Yes, at the end of the day it's still about suited guys beating the hell out of each other, and Nolan once again relies on old conventions/clichés (such as the 'ticking bomb' trope, which he's repeated in his last three films now) to see him through, but everyone runs so well and so smoothly that you end up not minding.

The cast is thorough and involved as ever, Bale as usual going the extra mile to portray the tortured hero and Caine lending emotional support as Alfred. Hardy's villain is a sheer powerhouse who dominates every scene he's in, and Nolan brings back a couple of his favourites from INCEPTION (Marion Cotillard and Joseph Gordon-Levitt) for good measure. There's not quite as much action as you might expect from a film of this type, but the storyline is so involved that you don't care. Throw plenty of stunning special effects into the mix and you have a real crowd-pleaser of a film with real brain as well as brawn."
"Chris Nolan has r-e-a-l-l-y outdone himself again this time. An amazing story that I don't even know who else could write such a treatment on the World's Greatest Detective, the crowning glory of Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy.

I remember I once made a joke to myself a long while ago about him that if he was going to make another movie, he would probably cast Heath Ledger and Joseph Gordon-Levitt's respective love interests from a movie of which they BOTH starred in and worked on-- 10 Things I Hate About You.

It would be ironically funny how both actors are connected to each other from working at different times with the ""holy-moly mind-blowing"" filmmaker and that the actresses that played their love interests would possibly too as well."
"I'll be brutally honest here. I liked The Dark Knight better than this. Even though its just couple of hours since I finished watching it.

Sure, TDK had its flaws, but then, it was such a marvelous noir saga, a treatise in crime drama that left us begging for more at the end. The phrase ""page-turner"" is often applied to engrossing books, but that could work just as well for the magnificent film. To this day, I cannot take my eyes off whenever I see TDK and by the time that ravishing interrogation scene between Batman and Joker is on, nothing is likely to stir me from my seat. By choosing to make the titular character undergo a perception shift, a massive (and ultimately successful) gamble was taken. And who can forget the late, great Heath Ledger's spectacular performance?

TDKR is not a bad movie per se. Seen alone, it has the ideal ingredients for a summer blockbuster: an A-list cast, monumental action sequences, modern themes of terrorism and official ineptitude, as well as intricate sub-plots which mesh well together at the end. There is more than a passing reference to the predecessors, especially Batman Begins (which, in my humble opinion, is an enormously underrated flick). And it works to a great extent.

Where this film fails as TDK succeeded is in the amount of layering. Some sub-plots were so complex that I was left confused as to where I was before that particular sequence (case in point: Blake's impromptu reconnaissance of a dockyard). Others were left frustratingly hanging in thin air. The plot also seems slow paced at first. While the first sequence is downright awesome, what follows afterward is distinctly underwhelming. Above all else, Batman is renowned to be a master strategist. Here, he ends up getting deceived not once, but twice at Catwoman's hands. You mean to tell me that eight years is good enough to make a superbly trained, marine-worthy, genius escape artist-cum-detective become dull? Really?

I won't go ahead and slate Nolan more here, simply because he gave me the privilege of watching two of the best superhero movies ever filmed in Batman Begins and TDK. The glass is always half-full in my eyes, and I'll admit that Hathaway and Gordon-Levitt were both perfect selections for their roles. I'm not too sure of Tom Hardy, since his performance is more physical than metaphorical but given his task was to exude a ruthless menace, he did his job. The rest of the familiar supporting cast are brilliant as before, especially with Caine showing his human side that we always suspected was well alive beneath that stiff British upper lip exterior and dry wit. I read somewhere that this is not a Batman movie, but a Bruce Wayne movie. And I fully agree. Having to reconcile (with unflattering results) with a life without Batman, Bruce is alone even as a social presence and a corporate figure. It is a true challenge but then again, Christian Bale turned in a remarkable performance in both BB and TDK (he held his own in those scenes where Ledger was not present). And in TDKR, he leaves an indelible mark on a role that would probably be the benchmark.

Batman Begins was all about ""Fear"" while ""Chaos"" was a running theme in TDK. TDKR does a great job in being a conclusion to the trilogy, but it is not the best one among the three, probably because there is no strong undercurrent of a theme here."
"I am a huge fan of Christopher Nolan and the first 2 Dark Knight movies, so I had high expectations for this movie. The Dark Knight Rises is good, but it is nowhere near the level of the other two movies. It has several things that are a bit cliché and it also had several plot holes that I found very irritating and distracting. My friend who I saw it with initially thought it was the best out of the trilogy, but after we discussed the plot holes that he missed, he ranked it as the worst of the three movies. Throughout the movie I felt like everything was a bit overdone. It seemed like they were trying so hard to make the ""epic conclusion"" that they forgot to make it realistic or reasonable. One of the things I loved about the first two was how it dealt with Batman in a fairly realistic way. There was a fairly good overview of how he functioned and how he was viewed. In this I thought there was much less dealing with the separation of Bruce Wayne and Batman, which was one of the interesting parts of the first 2. Also, I would describe the main character of The Dark Knight Rises as Bruce Wayne rather than Batman, which I found greatly disappointing. Still a good movie, but not nearly as great as the first 2."
"-Minor Spoilers- First of all, why hate so much? The movie is not perfect, agreed. It's not the best movie ever, again agreed. However it's one of the best movies, and it's pretty damn good, even if it's not perfect. The plot is good, the action is good, cast is great, acting is great too, and the atmosphere the movie creates is fantastic! Ignore all the hate, and please go enjoy the film. And I don't understand, why are people comparing this movie to TDK? They're by the same director and they're part of the same trilogy, no comparison. TDK is too perfect, and we all know that. So why did ya all have your expectations sky high. Whenever a director releases a movie which is near-perfect, then it is hard for him/her to beat that movie. Sure he/she can make a movie equal to the other one, but to beat it, think again. Thus my expectations for TDKR were high, but not sky high. And guess what? It crossed my expectations, and it was really close to TDK. Tremendous film!

Lately I haven't developed an interest in comic book reading, and I really don't enjoy batman or to be honest I don't enjoy much of superhero films at all. Only a few. However I didn't only enjoy this movie as a superhero film, I also enjoyed it itself as a movie. The reason I don't watch many superhero films is because they're very tedious and repetitive, and there's no message. Here is how your everyday superhero film goes ""There is ""Whatever"" man. Some stupid person attempts to outsmart the _____man, and take over the city, and guess what? He fails, and ______ man gets respect for saving the city...the end"". TDKR was out of the ordinary. To be honest, the whole trilogy was ""Out of the box"" thinking, especially this and TDK. Both this and TDK made it to my Top 10 films of all-time, and many movies at this time don't even make it close.

The movie did have its problems as well, it was not perfect. One of the major concerns was the time. The movie had a near-3hr run time which was more than enough. There were some slow and boring parts at the beginning and middle of the film, but as the movie approached the ending, none of this really mattered. Also I didn't really like how Bane died. He was really bad-ass up until the end, where Catwoman whipped him out in 1 second. I was expecting another fight between Batman and Bane, only to find out something else? It was too fast of a death, and not only that, he was the villain of the film, how can you kill a villain in 1 second? And it was not even Batman who killed him, it was Catwoman? I personally wasn't expecting this at all.

-Major Spoilers- The movie really kept you glued to the screen near the end. I really liked the plot twists and never expected some of them. Though some were predictable, but others weren't, IMO. For example, Batman surviving, and Talia escaping from the prison rather than Bane was pretty unpredictable. On the other hand, John Black turning out to be Robin, and Miranda Tate turning out to be Talia al Ghul was more predictable. I think there were some more plot twists, but I can't really remember, because I saw the full movie once, and that was 3 months back.

At first I thought Bane was the one who escaped from the prison, and was the son of Henri Ducard, but it turned out that it was Talia, and Bane was just a friend. This was the real shocker for me. I didn't really care much for the other plot twists, but this really shook me hard. I never expected this, in fact I even forgot about this up until the end. Also batman surviving? This was the second most unpredictable twist. At first I thought just maybe he survived, but after the funeral, I was sure that he was dead. Then he appears in Florence? This was pretty shocking as well.

The second half of the film was the best, because that's when the excitement began. I was very curious about what was going to happen next. After the explosion scenes, the suspense began to rise rapidly. Then the climax came all together very nicely.

My favourite parts of the film in the first half were the opening ""Plane Hijack"" scene, the ""Stock Exchange"" scene, and ""Bane vs Batman"" fight 1. In the second half my favourite scenes were the ""Football explosion"" scene, ""Bane vs Batman"" fight 2, and the final chase scene. Some of the other fight scenes involving Catwoman and Robin were pretty good too.

Final thoughts, I didn't expect much of this movie after TDK. TDK was perfect, and I thought this movie would be no where close, but it was pretty damn close. It was really good too. The action was great. The cast, acting, and dialogue were all fantastic. Especially the dialogue between Alfred and Bruce. Gary Oldman did a great job, not to mention that Joseph Gordon-Levitt did an amazing job as well. Tom Hardy turned out to be a great villain. Even though Bane's voice was kind of confusing, but it was pretty cool. Overall the whole movie includes some great action scenes, and runs a full circle completing TDK legend in an Epic way!

Final Rating 9/10."
"Christopher Nolan has out done himself again, striking not just Batman fans, but fans of the series and movie goers everywhere with his beautifully crafted, last installment of The Dark Knight trilogy, The Dark Knight Rises. The acting has always been well done in the last two, but something about the last one really made me feel the performances were real, quite like the late Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker. The movie ran about two hours and forty-five minutes give or take, but I never wanted it to end. The story progression never seemed to drag on, the movie always kept me on the edge of my seat. This is one that will be an all time favorite of mine, and a true classic.

10/10"
"I can't express in words of how amazing this movie is. All I have to say is go watch it for yourself.the is really the best,don't get me wrong i enjoyed the others but this one truly takes the cake!I said before batman begins is the best film i had ever seen without any exception. However viewing the 2005 Christopher Nolan production, I was pleasantly shocked. Then after my huge expectations for, ""The Dark Knight"", Christopher Nolan blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, ""The Dark Knight Rises""? Quite simply, Yes! My big expectations were once again, blown away. What a production! This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The editing, sound, score, visuals, direction and action are all top notch.I am wholly satisfied with Christopher Nolan's vision and thank all who worked on this film for bringing such an intricate interpretation of its very famous literary source.a big kiss for Christian Bale and Anne Hathaway i really love them.if i visit USA this will be for visit Christian Bale and Anne Hathaway. thanks for all."
"Christopher Nolan was assigned with the job of coming out with a new Batman movie comparable to The Dark Knight. Did he succeed? In short, yes. Is it better than The Dark Knight? No. But is it incredible, awesome, and everything we could have hoped for? Yes. This movie would be the best Batman movie and even one of the best movies ever if Heath Ledger wouldn't have put on the face paint. That's what I think is the biggest difference between the movies. While Tom Hardy's Bane is very very well done and flat out frightening at times, nobody can top Ledger's Joker. But don't think for a second that TDKR is any worse because of that.

The Dark Knight Rises brings the biggest threat of all three movies to Gotham in the form of Bane. Bane is Batman's biggest threat he's ever had physically and forces Bruce Wayne to return as Batman after entering an isolated state. Much less happens in this movie than in the previous two and I think it's because of the villains. In Batman Begins, Batman had to fight the Mob, Scarecrow, and Ras Al Ghul. In The Dark Knight, Batman had to fight the Mob, The Joker, and Two-Face. In The Dark Knight Rises, Batman has to fight Bane, and only Bane. From beginning to end, all Batman has to do is figure out how to defeat Bane and stop him from finishing his evil plot. While Batman Begins is some what lessened in genius because it has to tell the origin story of Batman, and The Dark Knight is just obviously amazing to everyone who sees it, The Dark Knight Rises has more of a hidden genius. Most people will miss all the symbols and why this movie is so brilliant and such a masterful ending to the Dark Knight's Legacy.

There's so much I wish I can say, but I don't want to spoil it for you. All I should say is see it. See it and be amazed by it. 10 Stars out of 10."
Gotham's reckoning.Well TDKR the last installment of the Nolan's Batman series ended in the perfect note the way trilogies are a supposed to end the real trilogy. So whats so great about this movie? This movie has it own moments when you get the chills on several occasions about whats is going to happen next it is almost breathtaking.Brilliant performances by all the actors in the movie.Hans Zimmer did it again by making the perfect score for the movie which will glue you to the seat and a wonderful plot which brings justice to the entire series. But but there is a but there are a few things which i felt should have been how it was which I am not going to mention because this needs to be a spoiler free review and i want it to be but this movie is worth every penny. Is this movie better than The Dark Knight? Well to that I have to think about it I cant sum up to the conclusion yet but again for me Batman Begins revolves around Batman The Dark Knight about the people of Gotham TDKR well why are you still reading this go watch it for yourself as i said it was worth every dime ...
"As a huge fan of superhero movies and undeniably the batman Christopher Nolan has depicted is the favourite of my choice. He is humane yet enigmatic, heroic and self-giving. Chris Nolan has produced superhero movies into a whole different level. The action, acting, sound and other visual effects was absolutely mind-blowing for the previous two productions. He is good at picking the right cast playing the right role like Michael Caine, Gary Oldham and Morgan Freeman who have always been the linchpin behind the success of the movie. I am also in awe of his previous works excluding the batman series such as Momento and The Prestige. So I had high hope and expectation on the Dark Knight Rises of how the director can build up the finale of the Batman trilogy which the world has long anticipated this blockbuster.

Judged by the content of the trailers, lots of people might expect it to be an action intensive film with lots of explosive elements and the elemental conflict between good and evil. If I'm honest, I have already seen most of the action scenes of the movie via the trailers before watching the film which is a saddening thing to hear from an audience's point of view. The entire film was almost three hours long and there were way too much chit chatting with the whole conspiracy by the villain but not getting down into the main point or the action bits. I think those scenes about having trials on the people by the judge whether they were guilty or not was plainly farcical in my opinion and quite cheesy which I never experienced in the previous two batman films.

The Dark Knight Rises has put in a lot of new characters who played a key role in the film including Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing John Blake and Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate. But the main villain, Bane played by Tom Hardy made me anticipated on how he can use his eyes as his weapon to proceed the acting, to show his wrath towards the corrupted society. I must say I was a bit disappointed at the villain role as the joker simply played too well in The Dark Knight in which Tom Hardy could not exceed the expectation. With those prestigious casts which all of them are great actors, I expected that it would be a sensational experience crafted by those actors. However, the entire film always talking about bits and bobs and never really get to one main theme. The experience was messy and too stuffed in without much focus to cause the audience to fall into the frictional world that Christopher Nolan was trying to present.

In conclusion, The Dark Knight Rises does not exceed my expectation nor better than the predecessor. I thought it was a let down the way how Christopher Nolan wrap up this impeccable Batman series. I only gave the rating 7/10 because of the two fantastic previous productions he made."
"The Dark Knight Rises (2012) The crusader in the mask For the last few years cinematography and special effects took a big step in improving the quality of their own products. That's why every new film set the bar higher and higher, therefor competition is rising. However, this is what exactly people want. Today once again saw this movie and decided to share my point of view, because while it is almost 3 years old, nevertheless with every time watching this film is no less mesmerizing.

In my opinion the plot of the third part surpassed even the second with loved by all great Heath Ledger as the Joker. It is very interesting and confusing, and if the beginning of the film (as is a rule in the case with Cristofer Nolan) is pretty tight, by the end of it is already impossible to put down. Eight years after the events of the previous part Gotham lives in piece and silence. Police Commissioner James Gordon feels guilty about covering up Harvey Dant's crimes and Dark Knight's disappearing because of that. However, events occurring in the city for the last days cry for help the hero, as well as the beauty who has got into trouble – Cat Woman. So Batman dares to speak out against the main villain – Bane. Christopher Nolan - a man who showed how the movie can be removed on comics. Already, it makes him one of the best producers nowadays. As he said, for the first Batman movie the main theme was ""fear"", for the second - ""chaos"", for the last - ""pain"". This pain is more soulful and Bruce Wayne will feel it completely.

Christian Bale – a man always on his top. For the late 80's and 90's kids he will always be the Dark Knight. Christian Bale is my Batman. He is my hero.

Anne Hathaway - a perfect Cat Woman. She is my favorite actress and she didn't disappoint me. It costs a lot. Joseph Gordon-Levitt played the role of energetic young cop - Blake. It seems this guy have a bright future, because Joseph is showing cool actor's skills. Morgan Freeman,

Gary Oldman and Michael Caine showed that ""old"" doesn't mean ""bad"". An incredible full compliance with the allotted roles. Soundtrack. «Basara Deshi» permeates the entire history by becoming the theme both for Bane and Batman.

I can say with certainty that the film was a success. Nice plot and amazing special effects because of the big budget are doing their job. Strong main villain who are all the time winning good guys causes the audience worry and fear. However, like rays are trying to break through the clouds, good is trying to break through. All this and beautiful Anne Hathaway don't give the audience to look away from the screen. Many of the best characters in the Batman universe, as if in a mirror, reflect the character of the protagonist, or when walking on the razor's edge between justice and revenge, or when caught in a trap of injuries in the past. Loyal fans of comics hardly surprised many plot twists, which is quite natural if we remember how the story developed in detail. For truly impressive how Nolan and his co-authors-screenwriter David S. Goyer and Jonathan Nolan managed to finish the trilogy of Batman. The film seems to be more emotional than the second part with it's psychological games. Of course, it has a lot of drama and even tragedy as well, but ""Dark Knight Rises"" touches the most. This large-scale painting, remaining harmonious, with great music and very beautiful camera work. However, the scope and action, going beyond imagination, leads to the fact that the scene, each of which is costs more than the budget of any other film, are perceived as ordinary events, while Bruce Wayne looks better in private moments, whether it's the episode where one of the characters finally realizes who is actually a man- bat, or the scene with the advent of a new character. Also there is a problem with the female audience understanding the reality of the plot, because there a lot of moments related to the previous parts. For example, such an important character of the first part and Batman story as Ras'el'Gul, whose name was named in a few episodes of the movie. Everyone should see this picture, are you a child or adult, it does not matter whether you love comics knight in black armor or you don't. Everyone who will leave the cinema will be inspired by something. Your brain processes speed up and you will feel strong and ready for new challenges. No matter where you are, who you are, when you are. What is important is that the message is delivered to you and it's your business what to do with it. Nolan and Co. did what they wanted to do. Created a symbol. Created a hero. My hero.

Score: 10 out of 10 Batmans"
"A feline fingerer has taken to your pearls, although identity's the intent of this girl, as she initiates engagement, allows the stirring of assuagement, the final chapter is prepared, starts to unfurl. A villain name of Bane brings down an empire, an exchange leads to a tomb, so deep and dire, a saviour's weaponised, the population terrorised, Ra's al Ghul's destructive end, is the desire. But there are those who can align and form resistance, as you recover your resolve and your persistence, as the endgame twists and turns, a web of intrigue is discerned, and you race to save the day and create distance."
"There's a common misconception when it comes to The Dark Knight Rises especially regarding how it tackles it's themes and story: this film isn't trying to raise the stakes, it's trying to add to the story, in this case his loneliness, his sense of powerlessness.

Hans Zimmer's score is some of the best I've ever heard, Wally Pfister peaked, had the best choreographed action scenes out of the whole trilogy, had the most emotionally resonant story out of the trilogy for sure. A very well made and satisfying conclusion that makes this trilogy one of the best .. ever?

A perfect comic book movie, certainly one of my favourites of all time"
"Christopher Nolan's *The Dark Knight Rises* serves as a powerful conclusion to his acclaimed Batman trilogy, delivering a breathtaking blend of action, emotion, and thematic depth that elevates the superhero genre. Set eight years after the events of *The Dark Knight*, Gotham City is in a state of uneasy peace, and Bruce Wayne, portrayed masterfully by Christian Bale, is a shadow of his former self. The film adeptly explores themes of redemption, resilience, and sacrifice, leaving viewers contemplating the complexities of heroism.

Nolan's direction is impeccable, capturing the grandeur and scale of Gotham in its darkest hour. The cinematography is striking, with sweeping shots that enhance the film's epic scope. The supporting cast, including Tom Hardy as the formidable Bane and Anne Hathaway as the enigmatic Selina Kyle, add depth and intrigue to the narrative. Hardy's portrayal of Bane is particularly noteworthy, bringing a physicality and menace that challenges Batman in unexpected ways.

The film's pacing is engaging, interspersing intense action sequences with moments of quiet reflection, allowing the audience to connect with the characters' struggles. The score, once again composed by Hans Zimmer, elevates the experience, underscoring the emotional stakes of the story.

Overall, *The Dark Knight Rises* is a triumphant conclusion that brings closure to Bruce Wayne's journey. It masterfully balances thrilling action with profound character development, solidifying its place as a modern cinematic classic. Fans of the genre and newcomers alike will find themselves captivated by this ambitious and emotionally charged finale."
"The tone of The Dark Knight Rises is set from the very first scene, when we are introduced to Bane (Tom Hardy) who crashes a plane that he himself is a passenger to. This is the first time we see the brute strength that he possesses. He is insanely strong through the use of the chemical ""venom"" which is pumped into him through his mask. As we leap into the rest of the story we see right away that director, Christopher Nolan, wasted no time in picking up right where he left off in The Dark Knight, with the death of Harvey Dent, and Batman being the criminal. This film was one of the big blockbusters in summer 2012, and for good reason. This movie brings the classic Batman comic book characters to life, which is evident in the acting, the sets, the script, the plot, and as many know, the dramatic ending. The acting is so well done, as we see emotion poured into each roll. Christian Bale (Bruce Wayne) Michael Cane (Alfred Pennyworth), Tom Hardy (Bane), and Anne Hathaway (Selena Kyle) all dove head first into their roles, leaving nothing behind. They each play a convincing role, identical to the characters that are portrayed in the Batman comics. One of the best examples is the relationship between Batman and Catwoman, because Batman is just, and Catwoman is a thief, but they are romantically involved with each other. The sets of this movie are stunning. Bruce Wayne's mansion and Batcave are just as they are depicted in the original comics. They are all encompassing and eye candy to any Batman lover. As we look back to the 1990's, we see a Batman comic book story arc that is very similar to the plot of TDKR. But Nolan's twist on the storyline is a refreshing change. Some may disagree, but not knowing what is coming next is part of the joy that comes with this film. Nolan keeps some of the key reference points in his film, but adds his own interesting, and modern additions to the film. Take for example, Bane's appearance. In the comics, Bane was unrealistically strong, and in the film he is much more realistically depicted. The only complaint I have with this film is, if Bane is so strong, why does he cover up his muscles with a vest or a coat for the majority of the movie? Show off your strength, be proud! The plot is the main focus point, like it should be. If explosions and fighting is all you want to see, then go see Pacific Rim. I'll say sorry in advance if you have wasted your time with that movie. Getting back on track to the plot, which might take a couple of watch throughs to fully catch all of the detail in this storyline. Throughout this movie, the focus is not on Batman, as one would expect, but on Gotham City itself. Bane brings the city to hell and back, and Batman is sitting on the side lines, bruised and battered, left watching, waiting, and hoping that his beloved city isn't left shattered and destroyed. The script of TDKR was written with pure precision, which allows us, as an audience, to remember key points of the movie through the use of dramatic quotes. Bane has a lot of one-liners that leave you repeating them to your friends after you see the film. Here are a few examples of memorable Bane quotes; ""But you merely adopted the dark; I was born in it, molded by it."" ""when it is done and Gotham is ashes, then you have my permission to die."" Because of Bane's voice, these short, memorable lines only add to the effect Nolan was going for. Leaving you on the edge of your seat wondering how Batman could possibly win? The moment you doubt if the good guy can win, that's when you know the director has succeeded.

This was a very well done film, and I encourage you to see it several times (it might take a few times to fully grasp the story) and the way this film ends is the perfect way to close out the series. In the end it all comes down to autopilot, back stabbing, and a turn of events by a woman you would not expect, all ending in an unpredictable manner."
The Dark Knight Rises is one of the most intense super hero movies I have watched. The opening scene is intense as the bad guys swing into action to get the good guys as the plane is moving into a tail spin. This time the world is void of the Bat crusader as he is in mourning the loss of his beloved. The plot lines are mix as you feel at times you need a chart to know who the good and bad guy is. The thread though out the movie is dark and deep and the most dramatic character is the bad guy Bane appears to take over the city of Gotham. A long movie that will keep you in total suspense until the end of the run. This movies does a good job of bringing into the mix several story lines from the comic book series. bravo!
"as much as i am huge fan of the batman in almost every facet of the genre, i am having a hard time getting completely behind this film. it makes the same mistake a lot of sequels do: it tries to pack too much into the story. the reason why the first two films in the trilogy, batman begins and the dark knight, worked so well was because they mostly focused on one central story and villain. in the dark knight rises there are too many new characters and too many story lines to be introduced and told that the film loses focus. sure it has plenty of action which you would expect but nolan strays too far from the source material when it comes to the characters in the film. the cast does a fine job with the script they had to work with and most film goers will probably like this film but i think true fans of the batman who know the history of the characters will wonder what nolan is doing to their batman."
"What is up with all this haters? Seriously, it makes me want to laugh because they're so ignorant. Some people here are saying: ""Worst Batman film ever"", or: ""I prefer watching Adam West Batman than this mess."" Wow, just wow. Anyways, enough complaining, this is one of the greatest conclusions in film trilogies history. No worry, this is a spoiler free review. The film is almost 3 hours long and the impressive thing is, the movie is NEVER dull, it's always keeping you interested because if its smart dialog and action. The story is great too. Bruce Wayne has stopped fighting crime as the Batman for 8 years after the Joker wanted to terrorize Gotham. But now a new threat has arrived, Bane. His plan is to burn Gotham to ashes and the Batman is the only one who can stop him.

Now the cast in this movie is really good. Christian Bale is a great Batman as always. Michael Caine deserves an Oscar nomination as best Supporting character for his amazing performance as Alfred Pennyworth. Anne Hathaway really impressed me as Catwoman. She steals any scene she's in. Tom Hardy as Bane is a great villain in this film. My favorite villain since the Joker. Joseph Gordon Levitt as John Blake delivers a good performance as well. Also Morgan Freeman and Marion Cottillard were good as well.

I love Trilogies, this trilogy is in my top 5 and ranks #2 right behind The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. In conclusion this is an amazing trilogy, the best of superheroes films and the second best trilogy of all time. All I have to say is, thank you Mr. Nolan, thank you. 10/10."
"This film is spectacular, the closest thing I have seen to perfection in film since the good ol days of filmmaking.

If you're hoping its better than The Dark Knight, your hopes have been answered. Christopher Nolan somehow outdoes himself once again, delivering a fantastic plot with great action, character development, and direction.

The writing itself is a wonder. The dialogue in this film is outstanding and perfectly fits each character.

Heath Ledger set a new standard for acting talent in comic book films. TDKR definitely meets that bar, possibly surpassing it. No single performance is better than Ledger's but everyone gives 110% in this and it comes together nicely. Christian Bale gives perhaps his most heartfelt performance in this one, and Tom Hardy is terrifying as Bane. Other regulars such as Caine and Oldman are just as good as ever. Joseph Gordon Levitt is a breath of fresh air and plays his part to perfection. However, I give it to Anne Hathaway for stealing the show. She is seductive, sexy, and dangerous as Catwoman, and becomes the very essence of the femme fatale.

Hans Zimmer continues to be my favorite film composer. His score simply blows me away, especially the way he uses the chants from the trailers as Bane's theme. Zimmer promised us an epic score, and delivered.

Editor Lee Smith and Director of Photography Wally Pfister both continue their win streak, as well as production designer Nathan Crowley and Costume designer Lindy Hemming.

All in all, TDKR is the best of this series. It is emotionally gripping and, at times, gutwrenching. As a current film student, I can honestly say that TDKR possesses all of the essential qualities of an Oscar for Best Picture. If you have seen the previous two Batman movies, you will enjoy this film so much more than you ever have. It truly is a whole new cinematic experience."
"So after seeing the The Dark Knight my expectations were pretty high for this movie and most movies would fail miserably but luckily The Dark Knight Rises is not one of most movies. It absolutely lived up to my expectations. What was good about the movie? Pretty much everything. The acting was top notch in this movie everyone does a good job in it. The action was great but the movie is great without action. Tom Hardy as Bane is one of the most terrifying villains I have ever seen. I likes the characters, the story everything. The one gripe that people might have is that it is very dark. But even that is not a real issue. In the end I loved this movie I recommend it to everyone an even though its not as good as The Dark Knight its still an amazing movie."
"Right from the start of the movie you will be on the edge of your seat. Personally I think this is the best conclusion I have ever seen. Performance of each actor in the movie is outstanding.Before I saw the movie I thought that Anne Hathaway wouldn't be as good cat-woman as Michelle Pfeiffer was, but not only was she better, she blew Michelle away. All the special effects are amazing and unbelievable. I have to say I love some of the batman's new toys. I have seen it in V Max theater last night but I am going to see it again in I MAX because Its worth the experience. It runs for 2 hours and 45 minutes but it felt like 30 minutes and I wanted more. 10 stars is not enough for such a great movie. I recommend to all movie lovers out there to go and see it in cinemas."
"what can i say really, this movie is fantastic. the plot is genius. the actors and so well put together. the best movie of 2012!

The direction they took this movie is beautiful. and the way ended the trilogy is breathtaking.

This is the best batman movie. his biggest job yet!

Save gotham one last time! the rise sequence is perfect. Lovie it!

10/10 all the way.

nolan the way.....

Nolan is amazing! :)

Also, Bane is great. Now i like joker and bane both. i like them eqaul. The joker scared me but yet i rooted for him. Bane really freaked me out! Scary stuff!"
"The Dark Knight Rises and Falls. I cannot put it in more simpler words than that.

I went in there with my coffers full of hope of having my mind blown out. After all it was Christopher Nolan and I am yet to see a work of his which has under-delivered.

But I guess everything has a first time.

Don't get me wrong. It's a good movie, not just a great one, and it left me highly confused as to how I should feel about it. TDKR, more than anything, falls under its own weight. With the endless hype and as a follow up to one of the greatest superhero movies of all time, TDKR had a lot riding on its shoulders. Tasked with this,Christopher Nolan has to be lauded for what he has achieved, or should I rather say 'hoped to'?

Let's begin with the basics. The Dark Knight trilogy was not a trilogy to begin with. Batman Begins (BB) and The Dark Knight (TDK) are almost two independent Batman films with little in common in terms of a story arc other than the characters it carries forward. That given, TDKR's greatest flaw was in attempting to connect the first movie to his final one so as to make it feel like one continuous arc. (Think kind of what happened in the final season of LOST) While I understand Nolan's intentions, the forced continuity just killed it.

This was further amplified by the many plot holes that marred the story. To keep this review spoiler free I will not mention any of them here but it will suffice to say that if you are a fan of the series but are willing to look past your fanboy goggles, the failings are plain to see.

Tom Hardy's take on the superstrong Bane was interesting enough to start off with, but as it went on there were just too many similarities with a previous villain (I will not say which one) to actually stand out on his own. Even his motives and methods were too familiar to be regarded as novel. His fights with Batman were epic enough though, and you almost pity Batman for having to face the mini-hulk that Hardy had transformed himself into. His menacing voice coupled with the cold hard stare in his eyes gave him the aura of a truly awful foe, one that must not be triffled with.

But add to that some cringe worthy dialogues, forgetful action sequences and appalling acting by Marion Cotillard, and I find myself subtracting more from the movie than adding. Nolan needed to make this movie bigger and better than the previous two, and for that he needed a crisis large enough to destroy Batman's world. While he did manage to conjur up a scheme, its immensity and implausibility made it hard to believe. I really wanted to love this movie but far too often found myself shaking my head in dismay as things got grander and larger, until they no more fit into the world.

But while I might seem to be cursing the movie a lot, remember I did say it is a good movie. And the best thing for me in the movie was - wait for it - Anne Hathaway as Catwoman/Selina Kyle.

I will confess that when I had first heard the casting I was more than dismayed. But now I'm forced to eat my own words. Anne Hathaway was brilliant. She might not be your regular comic book version of Selina Kyle, but in Nolan's Dark Knight universe she was the perfect choice to portray Gotham's sexiest vigilante. Everything from her stance to her fight moves and to the way she spouted sassy dialogues was perfect. Given more time and space, I am sure she could have probably stolen the show.

That however would have been unfair to Christian Bale/Bruce Wayne/Batman. The man has been a constant shining light throughout the series. He is a perfect fit for the role and has carried both versions of his character almost flawlessly. Moving into his third (and final) film in the series, I am glad to say he has not faltered a bit. While BB was about Batman, and TDK about the Joker, this movie was about Bruce Wayne the man behind the mask. As a superhero who is a mere mortal compared to most others out there, TDKR's focus on Bruce Wayne's mortality was totally warranted. This was not a Batman movie. This was a Bruce Wayne movie, with his alter ego guest starring. TDKR plays out like the swansong it is to this great character Bale and Nolan have moulded over the years.

Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine are as dependable as usual. They provided stellar performances as always. Even the newcomer to series - Joseph Gordon-Levitt gave a fine performance as the hotheaded cop John Blake. His character was by far one of the most interesting in the movie, developing into interesting dimensions, but alas finally being let down partly by the story and mostly by the limited run time that a movie of this scope can afford to a new character.

All in all, TDKR is a fine movie, but sadly nothing more. While I thoroughly enjoyed the ending (the last 5-10 minutes) and a bunch of scenes here and there, the action sequenced seemed bland, and the motives for some of the main characters left a lot to be desired. Batman was great as usual, but Bruce Wayne was better. And given the track-record of threequels, TDKR is a comparatively great ending to a great series, even if it is not all that it could have been. Probably the weakest entry to the series but nonetheless a wholesome entertainer on its own merits. Just don't expect to be blown away."
"I am not a critic but an average movie goer , but I must say that this movie is a pale shadow of the previous movie .

Missing the usual quality of a Chris Nolan movie . The movie lacks the frenetic pace of the previous title .First half of the movie is painfully slow . Second half picks up pace but still no big fireworks. Anne Hathaway unexpectedly performed very well in her role .

Weak story line .Background score average .Villain is simply lame with a dog mask ,and is nowhere near the calibre of Joker.No great twists or surprise in the plot ,lacks suspense .

Overall a better than average movie .Take my advice watch it at home ."
"The Dark Knight Rises is a brilliant,excellent and masterful epic conclusion to The Dark Knight Trilogy. Filled with excellent direction,wonderful performances,great Action and epic storytelling,The Dark Knight Rises is Christopher Nolan at his best.

Set eight years after the events in The Dark Knight,Batman/Bruce Wayne(Christian Bale) has been a recluse and retired as Batman and Gotham City has been at peace as well as safe and quiet. But when a new threat and terrorist named Bane(Tom Hardy)comes into Gotham City and threatens to destroy and demolish Gotham,Batman must come out of retirement to fight and face Bane and save the city of Gotham from destruction.

The Dark Knight Rises is a powerful and unforgettable conclusion to The Dark Knight Trilogy,it is a film that loved since I saw it in theaters and I cannot understand why the film has gotten a mixed to negative reception with most Batman fans. I guess because this film came out after Nolan's other films The Dark Knight and Inception which raised the bar really high when it comes to filmmaking and were universally loved by everyone and comparing this film with the other two this film can be seen as letdown for most people but not to me. The Dark Knight Rises is an Epic in the truest since of the word because Nolan has created a film that is big not only in length(2 Hours and 45 minutes)but in scope as well bringing everything to higher level whether it's the Action or the storyline. The film was so epic it probably would be longer with an overture like the epics of the 50s and 60s. Most of the time the third film in the trilogy is usually seen as the weakest but Nolan is a smart filmmaker who knows that if you are going to complete a trilogy you have to go out with a huge bang and TDKR goes out with not only a bang but with explosions. What I love about TDK Trilogy is that while all of them are three connected films all them are different in story. If Batman Begins is an origin story and Action/Adventure and The Dark Knight is a Crime Drama then TDKR can be described as a War Film. TDKR is War Film in sense where there are armies rising and gangs are controlling the streets with power,guns and tanks and Gotham is divided like a Civil War between the rich and poor or cops and criminals. With the theme of War and control running throughout the film you pulled into a Dystopian nightmare where Gotham City is being held hostage and not the cops or government can do anything about it and the only person that can do anything about is Batman. In TDKR we see not only the physical but also the mental toll being Batman has had on Bruce Wayne. Bruce has become broken down and a recluse and the damage of being Batman has affected his friendships and relationships or lack there of. Bane is such a great villain because where The Joker in TDK wanted to make people evil and corrupt and wanted to burn Gotham,Bane wants the people of Gotham to take control and take back the city of Gotham from the corrupt and the rich and create a revolution and army and still wants to destroy Gotham City. Bane is villain unlike Batman has ever faced before because Bane can match Batman on no only a physical level but on an intelligence level as well. The Action scenes in the film are amazing and like the first two films are done in a realistic way. Each Action scene is handled with a great deal of suspense and build up and this time it is done on an big scale to match the epic feel of the film. When the Action in the film happens you are glued to the screen and mesmerized. The ending of the film lasts about 20-30 minutes and it will blow you away with it's filmmaking and craft. The ending will have you cheering and smiling and it is a great conclusion to this film and The Dark Knight Trilogy.

The cast does an excellent jobs in their roles. Christian Bale is excellent in his final performance as Batman/Bruce Wayne bringing the same depth and intensity to the role. Tom Hardy is simply brilliant and scary as Bane,with using his voice,eyes and body language for the performance. Hardy's performance in my opinion makes Bane one of the best villains in film history. Gary Oldman is great once again as Jim Gordan,with Oldman bringing cynicism and depth to the role. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is fantastic as Blake,an idealistic rookie cop. Anne Hathaway is wonderful and sexy as Catwoman/Selina Kyle and has great scenes with Bale. Marion Cotillard does a great job as Miranda,Bruce's other love interest. Morgan Freeman excels once again as Lucius Fox,Batman's weapon maker. Michael Caine is amazing once again as Alfred. Caine's final scenes with Bale are powerful and well-acted. Matthew Modine(Foley)and Ben Mendelsohn(Daggett)give good performances as well.

The direction by Christopher Nolan is excellent and brilliant,with Nolan always moving the camera and having great shots and camera angles and giving the film an epic feel and Nolan does a great job with the Action scenes. Great direction by Nolan.

The score by Hans Zimmer is brilliant and intense and matches the dark and epic tone of the film. A great memorable score by Zimmer.

In final word,if you love Batman,Christopher Nolan,Comic Book films,Superhero films or films in general,I highly suggest you see The Dark Knight Rises,a brilliant,masterful and epic conclusion to an excellent trilogy that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10."
"well may lot of you not going to like my review cause am really really a great big fan of batman.after batman begins,and fabulous the dark knight,am just waiting when the 3rd installment of nolan series going to released.well a lot of time has passed but i am writing this review because i just thought i should have right something for it cause i love this movie.its almost 2 years now and trust me friends,,every night i watch one of the batman movie.specially dark knight rises,i have watched it more than 200 times.so i think you can imagine i am quite disbalanced from my head site.whatever people say it don't really matter.the only thing is matter how much did u enjoyed when you seen a movie.christopher nolans batman series is one of the best movies i have seen in my life.many many thanks to you sir.Christian bale,,you are just amazing.the joker, ben each and every character are truly remarkable.i just love the full batman team.the dark knight is the best in the series.but the dark knight rises may don't have the strong content like the previous installment but its really a huge entertainment for me.hope batman will come again to save the gotham..."
"Title: The title is perfect for movie story specially for main character. Actually it's better than 'batman' to me.

Genre: Action: In my point of view, action seemed to be a wrestling show.

Crime: Yes, this is an actual crime movie.

Thrill: It's truly thrilling at each and every sequence of movie.

Drama: The total dramatic plot is tremendously evolved with strong characters

Visual Effects: The batman's ride thing, bike, burning property etc are extremely accurate.

Character: Obviously Christian Bale and Tom Hardy.

Overall, I like it. It is really enjoyable and entertaining. Of course you'd want to see it again and again."
"I don't know where to start,. The power source shown in movie caught my eye;its very nice of Nolan to show the very future power source without loss of reality.

The action scenes between Wayne and Bane are so dramatic that when Batman hits Bane it clearly portrays that it was more out of confidence and will to fight against evil rather than strength and muscle whereas it appears opposite in case of Bane hitting Batman.The Catwoman's action scenes couldn't have been better the attitude,spontaneous performance,flexibility in physique are perfectly played by Anne Hathaway.

Hans Zimmer's music is an extra ordinary asset to the film .the back scroll in every action sequence is so wonderful to bring up goose bumps all-over.Especially the chant 'deh-shay bas-ha bas-ha' is clouded with drum beat and would take you into the depths of morality in the movie.

After a movie like 'The Dark Knight' its the very guts of Nolan to continue that should be appreciated.he must be a very good social visionary to write-up such an excellent ending to the trilogy.I don't need to separately chant praises on his direction and screenplay.And the twists in movie surprises everyone."
"With a gargantuan ambition, huge stakes, powerful themes, compelling characters and a fantastic third act, The Dark Knight Rises exceeded my already sky high expectations, and delivered an extremely satisfying conclusion to the trilogy."
"Words cannot adequately describe how awesome this movie is! It is everything you thought it would be and much more. Most certainly a beautifully crafted psychological crime thriller and a truly satisfying conclusion that does justice to the trilogy. Batman isn't exactly the cool hero with fancy gadgets nor is he the strongest. His inner strength is tested, he is physically and mentally pushed to his limits and all odds are against him. What an epic finale!

Christian Bale as always is perfect as Bruce Wayne and Batman but Tom Hardy's portrayal of Bane almost steals the show. Unlike Batman's mask where you get to see the emotions through eyes and mouth of the actor, Bane's mask covers his entire mouth, leaving only his eyes in view. Despite an obscured face, actor Tom Hardy seems to have found a way to brilliantly express his emotions physically! He projects Bane's character, the strength, pain, attitude and the darkness by movements and body language alone! Bane is as intellectual as he is strong, which makes him genuinely terrifying. He is easily the most formidable of all Batman villains in the trilogy and simply owned the scenes he was in.

Hans Zimmer does an excellent job with the background score that sets the pace of the movie and compliments the visual artistry. The music makes you feel the excitement and energy of the movie. Both Anne Hathaway and Joseph Gordon-Levitt do justice to their characters. Hathaway is believable as Catwoman. Last but not the least, Michael Caine gives a very effective and heartfelt performance as Alfred.

The special effects in this movie are so good, that it seems very real. The Batpod, which made its appearance in Dark Knight is back in this movie and it is exceedingly cool. But wait till you see 'The Bat'!

This movie has a stellar start, will keep you on the edge of your seat with adrenaline-pumping action sequences, intense drama both emotional and dark, has several layers of the story interweaving with frequent curve balls thrown in. But the movie never loses momentum, it ultimately sets you up for a fantastic climax and probably a very unpredictable yet satisfying end. It will keep you guessing till the very last second and that is the magic of Christopher Nolan's amazing masterpiece, The Dark Knight Rises.

I will give this movie 10 out of 10."
"Every time a good superhero movie is made ,fanatic fanboys have to rush to IMDb to declare it as the ""Greatest Movie Ever Made"" LOL,, I do give them credit for a least being consistent. With that said, it was a good movie but should not even be in any top 100. Yes, the storyline was far fetched for real life but hey, it's the norm for a sci-fi thriller action movie. Villain wants to destroy stuff,, hero must stop him. It was well acted, and the action, while not ground breaking was shot very well. While Anne Hathaway is great to look at, and done an okay job , I felt you could of totally removed her character from the entire film and it would not have made any difference . It was almost like her role was just filler material. In the end to me it's just a fun summer movie to get lost in,,but not to put on a pedestal..."
"The Dark Knight rises is easily the most anticipated film of the year and has a lot to live up to with the previous two entries just seeming to get better and better. With the same creative team intact, can Nolan and Bale pull off the ultimate finale to their trilogy and deliver the film we've all been waiting for or will it fall to the dreaded bad third film syndrome that seems to plague most series?

The Dark Knight Rises continues the journey of Batman eight years after he took the fall for the death and crimes of Harvey Dent. Forced back into action to take on the terrorist Bane, the Dark Knight returns to protect the city that looks at him as an enemy. The Dark Knight was a brilliant film on numerous levels so going in this film already had a big hurdle to overcome. While it may not have completely overshadowed the previous entry, it easily finds its place on equal ground. This final entry to the Nolan series continues to bring these three films together becoming essentially one long film. Rises brings new realm of personal journey to numerous characters old and new. Christian Bale steps back into the role like he never left bringing a new pain that seems to elevate both Wayne and Batman to another level. Most fans will be happy to know that while the growl like voice is still here, it is toned down a bit so not to be quite as off putting. Michael Caine is given a bit more to do taking the character study between Alfred and Wayne that has been building and he delivers more of his motivational and emotional speeches like only he can. Gary Oldman gets a bit more to do as well getting to channel the Gordon we have been waiting for since the beginning. Tom Hardy steps into the role of Bane, a character that is met with mixed emotions. Known in the comics as the villain that broke the bat, has had many incarnations, most of them not all that good and not widely known to those that aren't comic fans. Believe it or not, Nolan has taken a fairly single dimension character and brought to life a destructive force that smashes through this film with no remorse. The big surprise was Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle aka Catwoman. She seemed to be channeling some of the previous versions, most notably that of the 60's series minus the camp. She really makes this character work bringing the sexiness as well as a more empowered woman aspect to the character. She is easily the best incarnation of this character so far.

The story is well crafted bringing all the characters together along with the story to create an epic piece of filmmaking. There are numerous levels to the story that worked well for every character giving each of them their own small story without ever making the film feel overcrowded or forced. It takes a bit to get going, but not in a bad way. There are some pretty heavy moments that push this film along, but will keep you away from the action for longer than you may want. Much like the source material this trilogy is a character study of the inner struggles of a man and not so much about the action. Make no mistake there are plenty of action sequences, each bigger than the next. Nolan has slowed the action down a bit, namely during the fight scenes letting the viewer finally get a better glimpse of the Dark Knight in action. Kudos to Nolan as gone are most of the fancy well-choreographed fights and in their place is a brutality that is needed to make the Bane story work.

This is not only a great film, but a brilliant cap to an already brilliant series. It's a truly amazing experience to see this film come to life and wrap up a series that has continued to get better and better. There are plenty of moments that will make both comic and non-comic fans alike smile and cheer. Nolan has stamped his mark on the Batman universe and has done something almost never thought possible. He has delivered a brilliant Batman trilogy and managed to keep the entire brilliant cast in tact all the way down to members of the Wayne Corp board members. This is a film that will make you cheer and sad that it is coming to an end. As this series comes to an end and the credits role you will find yourself sighing in relief and happiness knowing Nolan pulled it off and wondering what's next for the Batman."
"Ultimately, this is an excellent film, but after seeing this as part of an all night trilogy viewing, I have to say it is not as good as The Dark Knight.

The film opens with, strangely for Nolan a quite farcical scene that introduces Bane. I won't spoil it, but please tell me, who takes 3 unknown prisoners on a plane without even looking at their faces? Really??

The proper story starts, and to chose words like jaded, withdrawn, cynical, tired, lethargic and disconnected, is how we find our hero and Police commissioner. So ultimately this is how the audience is manipulated into feeling too, and so act 1 is ultimately a long ""downer"" as lots of elements are put in place for the last 2 acts. But, after sitting through six hours of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, I was left feeling it was too much, and I started getting bored with the overall emotional shade of the film, coupled with the lack of action and the lack of any real story. It was like watching a plate spinner getting 40 plates spinning on pointy poles, necessary for his act, but ultimately boring for his audience.

The second Act is where our bad guy makes his play and gains the upper hand. One of the strongest sources of praise for The Dark Knight, is the ultimately real-world story telling. But what Bane unleashes on Gotham, takes us back to the more comic book villainy of the first film, which I won't criticise, but for me is not as rewarding as the realism of the second film. All the while our good guys are slow, wrong footed, and creaking under their mental baggage, so we are two thirds through a superhero film, where our superhero has been anything but. Action has been thin on the ground, and we have all been through the ringer, and we are crying for some redeeming pay-off.

After the third act, our her is restored, all has been put right. However, ultimately our pay-off for all we have been put through in the first two acts is only satisfying if you can shrug off the memory of what you have just been put through. It's much like childbirth, you need your brain to be swimming with endorphins to blank out the pain of labour, and for me, I didn't get enough endorphins to make the experience totally rewarding.

Add to this, a slightly facial bad-guy twist, and a groan-worthy sequel shoe-in, I have to say that Nolan has tried to squeeze in far too much, and Batman's saga creeps over the line, rather than ending with a bang, so much so, you will feel convinced that this is not the final part of the story, and we will need another installment to accept that our hero has sailed off into the sunset."
"Apologies, Dominus, I have done many reviews here but to get this one right took me 5 years and multiple re-watchings.

Conclusion? Not merely great, but the ""great-est"" superhero film of all time. The story is iconic and majestic in scope. The script not merely good, it borders on perfection. The performances are nothing less than stunning.

Bale and Oldman could not give a bad performance even if you asked them. Hathaway has never looked this good, her height and frame infusing her Catwoman with a vibe never seen before or since. And the almost-invisible Tom Hardy (one of the greatest actors of our age, BTW) makes Bane as interesting a character, if not moreso, than even Darth Vader himself.

So why did this review take me 5 years? To discover the dissonance between the three parts of the trilogy, which is the only flaw, the Achilles Heel of the boxed set.

Ordinarily a trilogy should be harmonious and consistent. Look at the original Lord of the Rings as the best example. Each part not only stands on its own but, taken in sequence, the story builds, the characters become clearer, everything works to a conclusion.

Like an orchestra reaching a crescendo.

Not so here. The whole is weakened by the sum of the parts. Batman Begins is, frankly, sloppy. Great ideas and even great performances are lost in a weak narrative with a unsatisfying conclusion.

The Dark Knight has become iconic in its own right but not because of the way it continues the story, but rather because of the amazing one-of-a-kind performance by Ledger.

It is only when we get to Part 3 that we achieve perfection. This film is not merely better than than the first two, it may be the best film of its genre, ever."
"It's been eight years since the events of the immediate predecessor to this(a film that this matches in most ways, tops in several, and the only thing it lacks that that has, is Heath Ledger's Joker, and, well, that's part force majeure), and we see the outcome of that. Legislation has made organized crime a thing of the past in the city, and with no need for the caped crusader, Bruce(once again impeccably acted by Bale... and yes, the voice has thankfully been toned down) has a gap in his life that he doesn't know how to fill(straining the relationship between him and Alfred, played by the usually charming and compelling Caine). When a mysterious masked man, known as Bane, a dominating physical presence with a brain(played largely by Hardy's eyes and brows... taking a ton of his tools as an actor away, and still he does incredible), with unclear motives makes his presence known, he realizes he will have to become Batman again. But is he enough to take out this new threat? This finishes the series, providing closure to the characters and story. Catwoman is done right here, and just about perfect. She's finally a femme fatale... hot and manipulative. They do with her what we hoped they'd do with Black Widow. And this does justice to the relationship between her and Wayne. The performances are great all around. Most return from the other two(and Freeman gets a lot more to do), with a few new faces, such as Gordon-Levitt as idealistic cop John. This does a lot to surprise us, and like TDk, it does it right, with hardly any of them being unnecessary, and none of them insulting. The bleakness is back and amplified - this puts its titular hero and its audience through a serious amount of pain and conflict, with a genuine feeling that it might not work out. And as a result of this, and other brave decisions made(you can barely believe these are mainstream movies!), it becomes really powerful, really draws us in. The action is the biggest and best of these(the jet he uses is awesome! And the Pod gets some more really cool use, in the edge-of-your-seat chases, and we get fast martial arts(and covered well!), and the stakes and tension are the highest(and frankly, if they were raised any higher, it would be excessive... this is already as draining as the last one). There is a lot of disturbing content, some violence and a little moderate to strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone interested in these(and make sure you've watched the other two first, this really adds to them). 10/10"
"Got to watch it in a preview show here in India. Was stunned with the way Nolan has narrated the story. It is simply AWESOME! Everything looks so perfect here, right from the starting, till the end credits roll. Even though i am not an ardent fan of action/superhero movies, I liked the first two installments of the series, so the expectation for this was so huge. And to be frank, i am happy with the outcome. Ii is brilliant in every aspect. Nolan's direction is top-notch and he is the real hero of the movie. I even felt goosebumps in certain sequences. I do not want to reveal the story much, but what i can say is, this one is a must for every movie lover. Such an awesome performance from Tom Hardy! I was just amazed to see him perform Bane. Christian Bale is no less, he is literally perfect reprising his role from the previous two films. The other actors have done good job. But i missed Heath Ledger, may his soul rest in peace. Anyway, what i have to say is, do not miss this film, lest it is a real loss for you. I would like to rate it 8.5/10, And Hats off to Nolan and the entire crew for giving us such a cinematic experience."
"Another achievement by Nolan Bros. and Warner Bros... Thanks to its huge budget available (ca 230 million USD) one could use state-of-the-art technology and employ a dream-team of actors of different generations: Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Anne Hathaway, Joseph Gordon-Levitt... And they got the opportunity to have elaborated roles to play, not just appearing in the background; Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth is probably the finest of the great ones. Moreover, it is no comic strip movie, but an epic story of universal values, attitudes and issues, with superhero and sci-fi moments complementing the script, not governing it.

Minuses from me due to length (ca 2,5 hours) and too obvious references/comparisons with characters from other hit movies (e.g. Hannibal, Catwoman, James Bond). But still, the movie is worth watching and recommendable!"
"This movie is full of excitement, explosions, and edge of your seat moments. It ties up all of the loose ends in a great culmination to the series. The casting is perfect. I was surprised by some of the characters that were added. I would have liked to see the story line continued though. It is a bit of a let down that they didn't incorporate more of the villains.Or even continue the series to include cooperative adventures for multiple DC heroes.It is great that they managed to keep all of the same actors from the previous movies. It irritated me when they changed the actress who played Rachel. I think that this is a good date movie or movie for a family with older children. Of course it is great for a guys night. Make sure you have you popcorn ready."
"As the ending chapter in the trilogy I enjoyed this movie the most. It had more of Bruce Wayne than just Batman. It showed Bruce's face behind the Batman mask and did so believably. Like we all know the Joker took the spotlight in the previous film and the first one was more Batman action. So we got a trilogy with a balanced focus between the guise, the seamlessly corrupt and the person behind the guise. Which is nice.

As a movie about the struggling person behind the mask this was, for me, the most touching out of the three films. And the most hope inducing, seeing Bruce Wayne recollect himself from the pit and rise to stand on his own feet. Re-mustering his courage and will."
